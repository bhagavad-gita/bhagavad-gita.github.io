CHAPTER FIVE Karma-yoga\xc3\x91Action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Consciousness

TEXT 5.1
TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?

TEXT 5.2
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better \nthan renunciation of works.

TEXT 5.3
TRANSLATION
One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced. Such a person, liberated from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.


TEXT 5.4
TRANSLATION
Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different from the analytical study of the material world [s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya]. Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths \nachieves the results of both.


TEXT 5.5
TRANSLATION
One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that the path of works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they are.
detachment from matter and attachment to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are.

TEXT 5.6
TRANSLATION
Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.

TEXT 5.7
TRANSLATION
One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working, such a man is never entangled.'

TEXTS 5.8-9
TRANSLATION
A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows \nwithin himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from \nthem.

TEXT 5.10
TRANSLATION
One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme God, is not affected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water.

TEXT 5.11
TRANSLATION
The yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.

TEXT 5.12
TRANSLATION
The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.

TEXT 5.13
TRANSLATION
When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither \nworking nor causing work to be done.


TEXT 5.14
TRANSLATION
The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.

TEXT 5.15
TRANSLATION
Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone\xc3\x95s sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.


TEXT 5.16
TRANSLATION
When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up everything in the daytime.

TEXT 5.17

TRANSLATION
When one\xc3\x95s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.

TEXT 5.18
TRANSLATION
The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste] .


TEXT 5.19
TRANSLATION
Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.


TEXT 5.20
TRANSLATION
A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, unbewildered, and who knows the science of God, is to be understood as already situated in \nTranscendence.

TEXT 5.21
TRANSLATION
Such a liberated person is not attracted to material sense pleasure or external objects but is always in trance, enjoying the pleasure within. In this way the \nself-realized person enjoys unlimited happiness, for he concentrates on the \nSupreme.

TEXT 5.22
TRANSLATION
An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.

TEXT 5.23
TRANSLATION
Before giving up this present body, if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses and check the force of desire and anger, he is a yog\xe2\x80\x9d and is happy in this world.

TEXT 5.24
TRANSLATION
One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who rejoices within and is illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.

TEXT 5.25
TRANSLATION
One who is beyond duality and doubt, whose mind is engaged within, who is always busy working for the welfare of all sentient beings, and who is free from \nall sins, achieves liberation in the Supreme.'

TEXT 5.26
TRANSLATION
Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are selfrealized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.

TEXTS 5.27-28
TRANSLATION
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within '
the nostrils\xc3\x91thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the tranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.

TEXT 5.29
TRANSLATION
The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.
