<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.1"><b>1.1</b></a>

Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra said: O Sa\xc5\x81jaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, what did my sons and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u do, being desirous to fight?
want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship!even for the denizens of heaven!Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra became very \nfearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\xc5\x81jaya was a student of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, Sa\xc5\x81jaya was able to envision the \nBattlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra even while he was in the room of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. And so, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.Both the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas and the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra belong to the same family, but Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants \nare taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra where the father of religion, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\xc5\x92etre and kuru-k\xc5\x92etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.
