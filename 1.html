<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.1"><b>1.1</b></a>

Dhrtarastra said: O Sanjaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruksetra, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, being desirous to fight?
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.2</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.2"><b>1.2</b></a>

Sanjaya said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of Pandu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following words:
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.3</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.3"><b>1.3</b></a>

O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.4</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.4"><b>1.4</b></a>

Here in this army there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhima and Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.5</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.5"><b>1.5</b></a>

There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, Kasiraja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Saibya.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.6</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.6"><b>1.6</b></a>

There are the mighty Yudhamanyu, the very powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi. All these warriors are great chariot fighters.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.7</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.7"><b>1.7</b></a>

O best of the brahmanas, for your information, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.8</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.8"><b>1.8</b></a>

There are personalities like yourself, Bhisma, Karna, Krpa, Asvatthama, Vikarna and the son of Somadatta called Bhurisrava, who are always victorious in battle.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.9</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.9"><b>1.9</b></a>

There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.10</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.10"><b>1.10</b></a>

Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhismha, whereas the strength of the Pandavas, carefully protected by Bhima, is limited.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.11</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.11"><b>1.11</b></a>

Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bhisma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.12</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.12"><b>1.12</b></a>

Then Bhisma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.13</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.13"><b>1.13</b></a>

After that, the conchshells, bugles, trumpets, drums and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.14</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.14"><b>1.14</b></a>

On the other side, both Lord Krsna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.15</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.15"><b>1.15</b></a>

Then, Lord Krsna blew His conchshell, called Pancajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundram.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.16-18</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.16-18"><b>1.16-18</b></a>

King Yudhisthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sughosa and Manipuspaka. That great archer the King of K\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d, the great fighter \xe2\x80\xa1ikha\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9d, Dh\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1adyumna, Vir\xe2\x88\x92\xc4\xb1a and the \nunconquerable S\xe2\x88\x92tyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d, and the others, O King, \nsuch as the son of Subhadr\xe2\x88\x92, greatly armed, all blew their respective conchshells.'
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.19</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.19"><b>1.19</b></a>

The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus, vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.20</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.20"><b>1.20</b></a>

O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, who was seated in his chariot, his flag marked with Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his \narrows, looking at the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] these words:

Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I must contend in this great battle attempt.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.23</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.23"><b>1.23</b></a>

Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.24</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.24"><b>1.24</b></a>

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.25</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.25"><b>1.25</b></a>

In the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa and all other chieftains of the world, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord, said, Just behold, P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, all the Kurus who are assembled here.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.26</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.26"><b>1.26</b></a>

There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his father-in-law and well-wishers\xc3\x91all present there.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.27</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.27"><b>1.27</b></a>

When the son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus:
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.28</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.28"><b>1.28</b></a>

Arjuna said: My dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth \ndrying up.'
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.29</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.29"><b>1.29</b></a>

My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end. My bow G\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9dva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.31"><b>1.31</b></a>

I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.
</p>

<br>
<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1">1</a>.32-35</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.32-35"><b>1.32-35</b></a>

O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.

<p>
<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/1.36"><b>1.36</b></a>

Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra and our friends. What should we gain, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our \nown kinsmen?

O Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one\xc3\x95s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the \nsin, engage in these acts?'

When irreligion is prominent in the family, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of \nV\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai, comes unwanted progeny.
