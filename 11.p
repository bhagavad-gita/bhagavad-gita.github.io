CHAPTER ELEVEN The Universal Form

TEXT 1

Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.

TEXT 2
TRANSLATION
O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.

TEXT 3
TRANSLATION
O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.

TEXT 4
TRANSLATION
If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.

TEXT 5
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, behold now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.

TEXT 6
TRANSLATION
O best of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas, see here the different manifestations of \xe2\x80\xa2dityas, Rudras, and all the demigods. Behold the many things which no one has ever \nseen or heard before.

TEXT 7

TRANSLATION
Whatever you wish to see can be seen all at once in this body. This universal form can show you all that you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in the future. Everything is here completely.

TEXT 8
TRANSLATION
But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.

TEXT 9
TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O King, speaking thus, the Supreme, the Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed His universal form to Arjuna.

TEXTS 10-11
TRANSLATION
Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many \nscents smeared over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. \nThis was seen by Arjuna.

TEXT 12
TRANSLATION
If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.

TEXT 13
TRANSLATION
At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.

TEXT 14
TRANSLATION
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.

TEXT 15
TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: My dear Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, I see assembled together in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 sitting on the lotus flower as well as Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and many sages and divine serpents.

TEXT 16
TRANSLATION
O Lord of the universe, I see in Your universal body many, many forms\xc3\x91bellies, mouths, eyes\xc3\x91expanded without limit. There is no end, there is no beginning, and there is no middle to all this.

TEXT 17
TRANSLATION
Your form, adorned with various crowns, clubs and discs, is difficult to see because of its glaring effulgence, which is fiery and immeasurable like the sun.'

TEXT 18
TRANSLATION
You are the supreme primal objective; You are the best in all the universes; You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest; You are the maintainer of \nreligion, the eternal Personality of Godhead.

TEXT 19
TRANSLATION
You are the origin without beginning, middle or end. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are among Your great unlimited eyes. By Your own \nradiance You are heating this entire universe.

TEXT 20
TRANSLATION
Although You are one, You are spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, as I behold this terrible form, I see that all the planetary systems are perplexed.

TEXT 21
TRANSLATION
All the demigods are surrendering and entering into You. They are very much afraid, and with folded hands they are singing the Vedic hymns.

TEXT 22
TRANSLATION
The different manifestations of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva, the \xe2\x80\xa2dityas, the Vasus, the S\xe2\x88\x92dhyas, the Vi\xe2\x80\x9cvadevas, the two A\xe2\x80\x9cvins, the M\xe2\x88\x92ruts, the forefathers and the \nGandharvas, the Yak\xc5\x92as, Asuras, and all perfected demigods are beholding You in wonder.'

TEXT 23
TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed one, all the planets with their demigods are disturbed at seeing Your many faces, eyes, arms, bellies and legs and Your terrible teeth, and as \nthey are disturbed, so am I.

TEXT 24
TRANSLATION
O all-pervading Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, I can no longer maintain my equilibrium. Seeing Your radiant colors fill the skies and beholding Your eyes and mouths, I am afraid.

TEXT 25
TRANSLATION
O Lord of lords, O refuge of the worlds, please be gracious to me. I cannot keep my balance seeing thus Your blazing deathlike faces and awful teeth. In all \ndirections I am bewildered.'

TEXTS 26-27
TRANSLATION
All the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra along with their allied kings, and Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa and Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa, and all our soldiers are rushing into Your mouths, their heads smashed by Your fearful teeth. I see that some are being crushed between Your teeth as well.'

TEXT 28
TRANSLATION
As the rivers flow into the sea, so all these great warriors enter Your blazing mouths and perish.

TEXT 29
TRANSLATION
I see all people rushing with full speed into Your mouths as moths dash into a blazing fire.

TEXT 30
TRANSLATION
O Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, I see You devouring all people in Your flaming mouths and covering the universe with Your immeasurable rays. Scorching the worlds, You are \nmanifest.'

TEXT 31
TRANSLATION
O Lord of lords, so fierce of form, please tell me who You are. I offer my obeisances unto You; please be gracious to me. I do not know what Your \nmission is, and I desire to hear of it.

TEXT 32
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you [the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas], all the soldiers \nhere on both sides will be slain.

TEXT 33
TRANSLATION
Therefore get up and prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyas\xe2\x88\x92cin, can be but an instmment in the fight.

TEXT 35
TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna trembled, fearfully offered obeisances \nwith folded hands and began, falteringly, to speak as follows:

TEXT 36
TRANSLATION
O H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You \ntheir respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All \nthis is rightly done.

TEXT 37
TRANSLATION
O great one, who stands above even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, You are the original master. Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the \nuniverse, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.

TEXT 38
TRANSLATION
You are the original Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You know everything, and You are all that is \nknowable. You are above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole \ncosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!

TEXT 39
TRANSLATION
You are air, fire, water, and You are the moon! You are the supreme controller and the grandfather. Thus I offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand times, and again and yet again!

TEXT 40
TRANSLATION
Obeisances from the front, from behind and from all sides! O unbounded power, You are the master of limitless, might! You are all-pervading, and thus You are \neverything!

TEXTS 41
TRANSLATION
I have in the past addressed You as \xc3\x92O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O Y\xe2\x88\x92dava,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O my friend,\xc3\x93 without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes alone and sometimes in \nfront of many friends. Please excuse me for all my offenses.

TEXT 43
TRANSLATION
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.'

TEXT 44
TRANSLATION
You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer You my respects and ask Your mercy. Please tolerate the wrongs \nthat I may have done to You and bear with me as a father with his son, or a friend with his friend, or a lover with his beloved.

TEXT 45
TRANSLATION
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.
are named. All of these forms are one and the same to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

TEXT 46
TRANSLATION
O universal Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form.
Godhead. One who knows K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

TEXT 47
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has \never seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.

TEXT 48
TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, \nnor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.'

TEXT 49
TRANSLATION
Your mind has been perturbed upon seeing this horrible feature of Mine. Now let it be finished. My devotee, be free from all disturbance. With a peaceful \nmind you can now see the form you desire.'

TEXT 50
TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, while speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.

TEXT 51
TRANSLATION
When Arjuna thus saw K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.

TEXT 52
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to \nsee this form which is so dear.

TEXT 53
TRANSLATION
The form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, \nnor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.

TEXT 54
TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.

TEXT 55
TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is \nfriendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.
