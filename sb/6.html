sri-pariksid uvaca
nivrtti-margah kathita
adau bhagavata yatha
krama-yogopalabdhena
brahmana yad asamsrtih
sri-pariksit uvaca--Maharaja Pariksit said; nivrtti-margah--the path of liberation; kathitah--described;
adau--in the beginning; bhagavata--by Your Holiness; yatha--duly; krama--gradually; yoga-upalabdhena--
obtained by the yoga process; brahmana--along with Lord Brahma (after reaching Brahmaloka); yat--by
which way; asamsrtih--cessation of the repetition of birth and death.
Maharaja Pariksit said: O my lord, O Sukadeva Gosvami, you have already described [in the Second
Canto] the path of liberation [nivrtti-marga]. By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to
the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with
Lord Brahma. Thus one's repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.
Since Maharaja Pariksit was a Vaisnava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of
the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned
souls from the clutches of maya and take them back home, back to Godhead. Therefore he reminded his
spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, about the nivrtti-marga, or path of liberation, which he had
described in the Second Canto. Maharaja Pariksit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met
Sukadeva Gosvami, inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation at that crucial time.
Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:
variyan esa te prasnah
krto loka-hitam nrpa
atmavit-sammatah pumsam
srotavyadisu yah parah
"My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people. The answer
to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists."
(Bhag. 2.1.1)
Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path
of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of
a Vaisnava. Vancha-kalpa-tarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vaisnava is an ocean of mercy. Paraduhkha-
duhkhi: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja, being
compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Sukadeva Gosvami
continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. The word asamsrti is very important in this connection. Samsrti refers to continuing on the
path of birth and death. Asamsrti, on the contrary, refers to nivrtti-marga, or the path of liberation, by
which one's birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure
devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately
returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti).
Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation
for the conditioned soul.
According to the opinion of the acaryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first
performing karma-yoga and then jnana-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can
be liberated. Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or jnana-yoga.
Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate
with no assets in jnana-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to
bhakti-yoga. Mam evaisyasy asamsayah. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.7) that by the process of bhaktiyoga
one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. Yogis, however, instead of
going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they
ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahma lives, as indicated here by the word brahmana. At the
time of dissolution, Lord Brahma, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the
spiritual world. This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows:
brahmana saha te sarve
samprapte pratisancare
parasyante krtatmanah
pravisanti param padam
"Because of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly
back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahma."

pravrtti-laksanas caiva
traigunya-visayo mune
yo 'sav alina-prakrter
guna-sargah punah punah
pravrtti--by inclination; laksanah--symptomized; ca--also; eva--indeed; trai-gunya--the three modes of
nature; visayah--possessing as objectives; mune--O great sage; yah--which; asau--that; alina-prakrteh--of
one who is not freed from the clutches of maya; guna-sargah--in which there is a creation of material
bodies; punah punah--again and again.
O great sage Sukadeva Gosvami, unless the living entity is freed from the infection of the material
modes of nature, he receives different types of bodies in which to enjoy or suffer, and according to the
body, he is understood to have various inclinations. By following these inclinations he traverses the path
called pravrtti-marga, by which one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, as you have already
described [in the Third Canto].
As Lord Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita (9.25):
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitrn yanti pitr-vratah
bhutani yanti bhutejya
yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam
"Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and
spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who
worship Me will live with Me." Because of the influence of the various modes of nature, the living entities
have various tendencies or propensities, and therefore they are qualified to achieve various destinations.
As long as one is materially attached, he wants to be elevated to the heavenly planets because of his
attraction to the material world. The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares, however, "Those who
worship Me come to Me." If one has no information about the Supreme Lord and His abode, one tries to
be elevated only to a higher material position, but when one concludes that in this material world there is
nothing but repeated birth and death, he tries to return home, back to Godhead. If one attains that
destination, he need never return to this material world (yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam
mama). As Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 19.151):
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
"According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe. Some of
them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower
planetary systems. Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an
opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krsna. By the mercy of both
Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service." All
living entities are rotating throughout the universe, going sometimes up to the higher planetary systems
and sometimes down to the lower planets. This is the material disease, which is known as pravrtti-marga.
When one becomes intelligent he takes to nivrtti-marga, the path of liberation, and thus instead of
rotating within this material world, he returns home, back to Godhead. This is necessary.

My dear lord, you have described the dynasties and characteristics of King Priyavrata and King
Uttanapada. The Supreme Personality of Godhead created this material world with various universes,
planetary systems, planets and stars, with varied lands, seas, oceans, mountains, rivers, gardens and trees,
all with different characteristics. These are divided among this planet earth, the luminaries in the sky and
the lower planetary systems. You have very clearly described these planets and the living entities who live
on them.
Here the words yathedam asrjad vibhuh clearly indicate that the Supreme, the great, almighty
Personality of Godhead, created this entire material world with its different varieties of planets, stars and
so forth. Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot
explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty
power behind them. Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time. In Bhagavad-gita (10.8), the Lord
says, aham sarvasya prabhavo: "I am the origin of everything." Mattah sarvam pravartate: "whatever exists
in the creation emanates from Me." Iti matva bhajante mam budha bhava-samanvitah: "When one fully
understands that I create everything by My omnipotence, one becomes firmly situated in devotional
service and fully surrenders at My lotus feet." Unfortunately, the unintelligent cannot immediately
understand Krsna's supremacy. Nonetheless, if they associate with devotees and read authorized books,
they may gradually come to the proper understanding, although this may take many, many births. As
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.19):
bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be
the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." Vasudeva, Krsna, is the creator of
everything, and His energy is displayed in various ways. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5), a
combination of the material energy (bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh) and the spiritual energy, the living entity,
exists in every creation. Therefore the same principle, the combination of the supreme spirit and the
material elements, is the cause of the cosmic manifestation.

O greatly fortunate and opulent Sukadeva Gosvami, now kindly tell me how human beings may be
saved from having to enter hellish conditions in which they suffer terrible pains.
In the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Canto, Sukadeva Gosvami has explained that people who
commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer. Now Maharaja Pariksit, being a devotee,
is concerned with how this can be stopped. A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; in other words, he has no
personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble. Prahlada Maharaja said, "My Lord, I
have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter
a trance of ecstasy. I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who
are busy with maya-sukha, temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You."
This is the problem faced by a Vaisnava. Because a Vaisnava fully takes shelter of the Supreme personality
of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen,
conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the
next. Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from Sukadeva Gosvami how humanity can
be saved from gliding down to hell. Sukadeva Gosvami had already explained how people enter hellish
life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it. Intelligent men must take advantage of
these instructions. Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking Krsna consciousness, and therefore
people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one. To
convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of
material enjoyment. Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them. Maharaja Pariksit is
the representative of one who can save them.

sri-sukah uvaca--Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said; na--not; cet--if; iha--within this life; eva--certainly;
apacitim--counteraction, atonement; yatha--duly; amhasah krtasya--when one has performed sinful
activities; kuryat--performs; manah--with the mind; ukta--words; panibhih--and with the senses;

hellish conditions; upaiti--attains; ye--which; kirtitah--were already described; me--by me; bhavatah--unto
you; tigma-yatanah--in which there is very terrible suffering.
Sukadeva Gosvami replied: My dear King, if before one's next death whatever impious acts one has
performed in this life with his mind, words and body are not counteracted through proper atonement
according to the description of the Manu-samhita and other dharma-sastras, one will certainly enter the
hellish planets after death and undergo terrible suffering, as I have previously described to you.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura mentions that although Maharaja Pariksit was a pure devotee,
Sukadeva Gosvami did not immediately speak to him about the strength of devotional service. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
Devotional service is so strong that if one fully surrenders to Krsna and takes fully to His devotional
service, the reactions of his sinful life immediately stop.
Elsewhere in the Gita (18.66), Lord Krsna urges that one give up all other duties and surrender to Him,
and He promises, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami: "I shall free you from all sinful reactions and
give you liberation." Therefore in response to the inquiries of Pariksit Maharaja, Sukadeva Gosvami, his
guru, could have immediately explained the principle of bhakti, but to test Pariksit Maharaja's
intelligence, he first prescribed atonement according to karma-kanda, the path of fruitive activities. For
karma-kanda there are eighty authorized scriptures, such as Manu-samhita, which are known as dharmasastras.
In these scriptures one is advised to counteract his sinful acts by performing other types of fruitive
action. This was the path first recommended by Sukadeva Gosvami to Maharaja Pariksit, and actually it is
a fact that one who does not take to devotional service must follow the decision of these scriptures by
performing pious acts to counteract his impious acts. This is known as atonement.

tasmat--therefore; pura--before; eva--indeed; asu--very quickly; iha--in this life; papa-niskrtau--to
become free from the reaction of sinful activities; yateta--one should endeavor; mrtyoh--death;
avipadyata--not troubled by disease and old age; atmana--with a body; dosasya--of the sinful activities;
drstva--estimating; guru-laghavam--the heaviness or lightness; yatha--just like; bhisak--a physician;
cikitseta--would treat; rujam--of disease; nidana-vit--one who is expert in diagnosis.
Therefore, before one's next death comes, as long as one's body is strong enough, one should quickly
adopt the process of atonement according to sastra; otherwise one's time will be lost, and the reactions of
his sins will increase. As an expert physician diagnoses and treats a disease according to its gravity, one
should undergo atonement according to the severity of one's sins.
The dharma-sastras like the Manu-samhita prescribe that a man who has committed murder should be
hanged and his own life sacrificed in atonement. Previously this system was followed all over the world,
but since people are becoming atheists, they are stopping capital punishment. This is not wise. Herein it is
said that a physician who knows how to diagnose a disease prescribes medicine accordingly. If the disease
is very serious, the medicine must be strong. The weight of a murderer's sin is very great, and therefore
according to Manu-samhita a murderer must be killed. By killing a murderer the government shows
mercy to him because if a murderer is not killed in this life, he will be killed and forced to suffer many
times in future lives. Since people do not know about the next life and the intricate workings of nature,
they manufacture their own laws, but they should properly consult the established injunctions of the
sastras and act accordingly. In India even today the Hindu community often takes advice from expert
scholars regarding how to counteract sinful activities. In Christianity also there is a process of confession
and atonement. Therefore atonement is required, and atonement must be undergone according to the
gravity of one's sinful acts.

scriptures or lawbooks); yat--since; papam--sinful, criminal action; janan--knowing; api--although;
atmanah--of his self; ahitam--injurious; karoti--he acts; bhuyah--again and again; vivasah--unable to
control himself; prayascittam--atonement; atho--therefore; katham--what is the value of.
Maharaja Pariksit said: One may know that sinful activity is injurious for him because he actually sees
that a criminal is punished by the government and rebuked by people in general and because he hears
from scriptures and learned scholars that one is thrown into hellish conditions in the next life for
committing sinful acts. Nevertheless, in spite of such knowledge, one is forced to commit sins again and
again, even after performing acts of atonement. Therefore, what is the value of such atonement?
In some religious sects a sinful man goes to a priest to confess his sinful acts and pay a fine, but then he
again commits the same sins and returns to confess them again. This is the practice of a professional
sinner. Pariksit Maharaja's observations indicate that even five thousand years ago it was the practice of
criminals to atone for their crimes but then commit the same crimes again, as if forced to do so.
Therefore, owing to his practical experience, Pariksit Maharaja saw that the process of repeatedly sinning
and atoning is pointless. Regardless of how many times he is punished, one who is attached to sense
enjoyment will commit sinful acts again and again until he is trained to refrain from enjoying his senses.
The word vivasa is used herein, indicating that even one who does not want to commit sinful acts will be
forced to do so by habit. Pariksit Maharaja therefore considered the process of atonement to have little
value for saving one from sinful acts. In the following verse he further explains his rejection of this
process.

Sometimes one who is very alert so as not to commit sinful acts is victimized by sinful life again. I
therefore consider this process of repeated sinning and atoning to be useless. It is like the bathing of an
elephant, for an elephant cleanses itself by taking a full bath, but then throws dust over its head and body
as soon as it returns to the land.
When Pariksit Maharaja inquired how a human being could free himself from sinful activities so as not
to be forced to go to hellish planetary systems after death, Sukadeva Gosvami answered that the process of
counteracting sinful life is atonement. In this way Sukadeva Gosvami tested the intelligence of Maharaja
Pariksit, who passed the examination by refusing to accept this process as genuine. Now Pariksit Maharaja
is expecting another answer from his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami.

sri-badarayanih uvaca--Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vyasadeva, replied; karmana--by fruitive
activities; karma-nirharah--counteraction of fruitive activities; na--not; hi--indeed; atyantikah--final;
isyate--becomes possible; avidvat-adhikaritvat--from being without knowledge; prayascittam--real
atonement; vimarsanam--full knowledge of Vedanta.
Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vedavyasa, answered: My dear King, since acts meant to neutralize
impious actions are also fruitive, they will not release one from the tendency to act fruitively. Persons who
subject themselves to the rules and regulations of atonement are not at all intelligent. Indeed, they are in
the mode of darkness. Unless one is freed from the mode of ignorance, trying to counteract one action
through another is useless because this will not uproot one's desires. Thus even though one may
superficially seem pious, he will undoubtedly be prone to act impiously. Therefore real atonement is
enlightenment in perfect knowledge, Vedanta, by which one understands the Supreme Absolute Truth.
The guru, Sukadeva Gosvami, has examined Pariksit Maharaja, and it appears that the King has passed
one phase of the examination by rejecting the process of atonement because it involves fruitive activities.
Now Sukadeva Gosvami is suggesting the platform of speculative knowledge. Progressing from karmakanda
to jnana-kanda, he is proposing, prayascittam vimarsanam: "Real atonement is full knowledge."
Vimarsana refers to the cultivation of speculative knowledge. In Bhagavad-gita, karmis, who are lacking in
knowledge, are compared to asses. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." Thus karmis who
engage in sinful acts and who do not know the true objective of life are called mudhas, asses. Vimarsana,
however, is also explained in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), where Krsna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah:
the purpose of Vedic study is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one studies Vedanta
but merely advances somewhat in speculative knowledge and does not understand the Supreme Lord, one
remains the same mudha. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.19), one attains real knowledge when he
understands Krsna and surrenders unto Him (bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate). To
become learned and free from material contamination, therefore, one should try to understand Krsna, for
thus one is immediately liberated from all pious and impious activities and their reactions.

My dear King, if a diseased person eats the pure, uncontaminated food prescribed by a physician, he is
gradually cured, and the infection of disease can no longer touch him. Similarly, if one follows the
regulative principles of knowledge, he gradually progresses toward liberation from material
contamination.
One is gradually purified if one cultivates knowledge, even through mental speculation, and strictly
follows the regulative principles enjoined in the sastras and explained in the next verse. Therefore the
platform of jnana, speculative knowledge, is better than the platform of karma, fruitive action. There is
every chance of falling from the platform of karma to hellish conditions, but on the platform of jnana one
is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection. The difficulty is that on
the platform of jnana one thinks that he has been liberated and has become Narayana, or Bhagavan. This
is another phase of ignorance.

Because of ignorance, one speculatively thinks himself liberated from material contamination although
actually he is not. Therefore even if one rises to brahma jnana, understanding of Brahman, one
nevertheless falls down because of not taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna. Nonetheless, jnanis at least
know what is sinful and what is pious, and they very cautiously act according to the injunctions of the
sastras.

austerity); samena--by controlling the mind; ca--and; damena--by fully controlling the senses; ca--also;
tyagena--by voluntarily giving charity to good causes; satya--by truthfulness; saucabhyam--and by

To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the
austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give
charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy
name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily
purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of
creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again
at the first opportunity.
Tapah is explained in the smrti-sastra as follows: manasas cendriyanam ca aikagryam paramam tapah.
"Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is
called tapah." Our Krsna consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on
devotional service. This is first-class tapah. Brahmacarya, the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should
not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with
women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex
life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is
called first-class brahmacarya. If a brahmacari or sannyasi talks with a woman in a secluded place,
naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone's knowledge. Therefore a complete
brahmacari practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect brahmacari, he can very easily control the mind
and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue
and the process of eating.
In the bhakti-marga, the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by
first controlling the tongue (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah). The tongue (jihva) can
be controlled if one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, does not speak of any subjects other than those
concerning Krsna and does not taste anything not offered to Krsna. If one can control the tongue in this
way, brahmacarya and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next
verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of
fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the Vedas, Srila Viraraghava Acarya explains
that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (tapasanasakena). Srila Rupa Gosvami has also
advised that atyahara, too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in
Bhagavad-gita (6.17) Krsna says:
yuktahara-viharasya
yukta-cestasya karmasu
yukta-svapnavabodhasya
yogo bhavati duhkha-ha
"He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material
pains by practicing the yoga system."
In text 14 the word dhirah, meaning "those who are undisturbed under all circumstances," is very
significant. Krsna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." In
material life there are many disturbances (adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika). One who has
learned to tolerate these disturbances under all circumstances is called dhira.

kecit kevalaya bhaktya
vasudeva-parayanah
agham dhunvanti kartsnyena
niharam iva bhaskarah
kecit--some people; kevalaya bhaktya--by executing unalloyed devotional service; vasudeva--to Lord
Krsna, the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead; parayanah--completely attached (only to such
service, without dependence on austerity, penance, cultivation of knowledge or pious activities); agham--
all kinds of sinful reactions; dhunvanti--destroy; kartsnyena--completely (with no possibility that sinful
desires will revive); niharam--fog; iva--like; bhaskarah--the sun.
Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the
weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging
devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.
In the previous verse Sukadeva Gosvami gave the example that the dried leaves of creepers beneath a
bamboo tree may be completely burnt to ashes by a fire, although the creepers may sprout again because
the root is still in the ground. Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a
person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that
his sinful desires will reappear. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.4):
sreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho
klisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
Speculators who undergo great labor to gain a meticulous understanding of the material world by
distinguishing between sinful and pious activities, but who are not situated in devotional service, are
prone to material activities. They may fall down and become implicated in fruitive activities. If one
becomes attached to devotional service, however, his desires for material enjoyment are automatically
vanquished without separate endeavor. Bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: if one is advanced in
Krsna consciousness, material activities, both sinful and pious, automatically become distasteful to him.
That is the test of Krsna consciousness. Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance
because a living entity, as an eternal servant of Krsna, has no need to act for his personal sense
gratification. Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes
his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy Krsna. This
process of bhakti, devotional service to Krsna (vasudeva-parayana), relieves one from the reactions of all
activities.
Since Maharaja Pariksit was a great devotee. the answers of his guru, Sukadeva Gosvami, concerning
karma-kanda and jnana-kanda could not satisfy him. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, knowing very well the
heart of his disciple, explained the transcendental bliss of devotional service. The word kecit, which is
used in this verse, means. "a few people but not all." Not everyone can become Krsna conscious. As Krsna
explains in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." Practically no one understands Krsna as He is, for Krsna
cannot be understood through pious activities or attainment of the most elevated speculative knowledge.
Actually the highest knowledge consists of understanding Krsna. Unintelligent men who do not
understand Krsna are grossly puffed up, thinking that they are liberated or have themselves become Krsna
or Narayana. This is ignorance.
To indicate the purity of bhakti, devotional service, Srila Rupa Gosvami says in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
(1.1.11):
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." Srila Rupa Gosvami further explains that bhakti is klesaghni subhada, which
means if one takes to devotional service, all kinds of unnecessary labor and material distress cease entirely
and one achieves all good fortune. Bhakti is so powerful that it is also said to be moksa-laghutakrt; in
other words, it minimizes the importance of liberation.
Nondevotees must undergo material hardships because they are prone to commit sinful fruitive
activities. The desire to commit sinful actions continues in their hearts due to ignorance. These sinful
actions are divided into three categories--pataka, maha-pataka and atipataka--and also into two divisions;
prarabdha and aprarabdha. Prarabdha refers to sinful reactions from which one is suffering at the present,
and aprarabdha refers to sources of potential suffering. When the seeds (bija) of sinful reactions have not
yet fructified, the reactions are called aprarabdha. These seeds of sinful action are unseen, but they are
unlimited, and no one can trace when they were first planted. Because of prarabdha, sinful reactions that
have already fructified, one is seen to have taken birth in a low family or to be suffering from other
miseries.
When one takes to devotional service, however, all phases of sinful life, including prarabdha,
aprarabdha and bija, are vanquished. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.19) Lord Krsna tells Uddhava:
yathagnih susamrddharcih
karoty edhamsi bhasmasat
tatha mad-visaya bhaktir
uddhavainamsi krtsnasah
"My dear Uddhava, devotional service in relationship with Me is like a blazing fire that can burn to
ashes all the fuel of sinful activities supplied to it." How devotional service vanquishes the reactions of
sinful life is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.6) in a verse spoken during Lord Kapiladeva's
instructions to His mother, Devahuti. Devahuti said:
yan-namadheya-sravananukirtanad
yat-prahvanad yat-smaranad api kvacit
svado 'pi sadyah savanaya kalpate
kutah punas te bhagavan nu darsanat
"My dear Lord, if even a person born in a family of dog-eaters hears and repeats the chanting of Your
glories, offers respects to You and remembers You, he is immediately greater than a brahmana and is
therefore eligible to perform sacrifices. Therefore, what is to be said of one who has seen You directly?"
In the Padma purana there is a statement that persons whose hearts are always attached to the
devotional service of Lord Visnu are immediately released from all the reactions of sinful life. These
reactions generally exist in four phases. Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are
in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current. All such reactions are immediately
nullified by devotional service. When devotional service is present in one's heart, desires to perform sinful
activities have no place there. Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one's
constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully Krsna conscious he realizes that
he is God's eternal servant.
In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami comments that bhakti may be divided into two divisions: (1) santata,
devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) kadacitki, devotional service that
does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened. Incessantly flowing devotional service (santata)
may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2)
spontaneous devotional service. Intermittent devotional service (kadacitki) may be divided into three
categories: (1) ragabhasamayi, devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) ragabhasa-sunyasvarupa-
bhuta, devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional
position of serving, and (3) abhasa-rupa, a slight glimpse of devotional service. As for atonement, if one
has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo prayascitta, atonement, are
superseded. Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and,
above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in kadacitki. Even in the
stage of abhasa-rupa bhakti, all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished. Srila Jiva Gosvami
expresses the opinion that the word kartsnyena means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful
actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by abhasa-rupa bhakti. The example of bhaskara,
the sun, is most appropriate. The abhasa feature of bhakti is compared to twilight, and the accumulation
of one's sinful activities is compared to fog. Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do
no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears. Similarly, if one has even
a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished.

na tatha hy aghavan rajan

na--not; tatha--so much; hi--certainly; agha-van--a man full of sinful activities; rajan--O King; puyeta--
can become purified; tapah-adibhih--by executing the principles of austerity, penance, brahmacarya and
other purifying processes; yatha--as much as; krsna-arpita-pranah--the devotee whose life is fully Krsna
conscious; tat-purusa-nisevaya--by engaging his life in the service of Krsna's representative.
My dear King, if a sinful person engages in the service of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and thus learns
how to dedicate his life unto the lotus feet of Krsna, he can be completely purified. One cannot be purified
merely by undergoing austerity, penance, brahmacarya and the other methods of atonement I have
previously described.
Tat-purusa refers to a preacher of Krsna consciousness, such as the spiritual master. Srila Narottama
dasa Thakura has said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: "Without serving a bona fide spiritual
master, an ideal Vaisnava, who can be delivered from the clutches of maya?" This idea is also expressed in
many other places. Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) says, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh: if one desires
liberation from the clutches of maya, one must associate with a pure devotee mahatma. A mahatma is one
who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.13):
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible." Thus the symptom of a mahatma is that he has no engagement
other than service to Krsna. One must render service to a Vaisnava in order to get freed from sinful
reactions, revive one's original Krsna consciousness and be trained in how to love Krsna. This is the result
of mahatma-seva. Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one's sinful
life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock
of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for Krsna. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight,
one's sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no
separate endeavor is required.
The word krsna-rpita-pranah refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving Krsna, not to being
saved from the path to hellish life. A devotee is narayana-parayana, or vasudeva-parayana, which means
that the path of Vasudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana
bibhyati (Bhag. 6.17.28): such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere. There is a path toward liberation
in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a narayana-para devotee is
unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember Krsna, wherever he may be. Such a devotee is
unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to Krsna. When a devotee is
put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as Krsna's mercy: tat te 'nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag.
10.14.8). He does not protest, "Oh, I am such a great devotee of Krsna. Why have I been put into this
misery?" Instead he thinks, "This is Krsna's mercy." Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who
engages in the service of Krsna's representative. This is the secret of success.

The path followed by pure devotees, who are well behaved and fully endowed with the best
qualifications, is certainly the most auspicious path in this material world. It is free from fear, and it is
authorized by the sastras.
One should not think that the person who takes to bhakti is one who cannot perform the ritualistic
ceremonies recommended in the karma-kanda section of the Vedas or is not sufficiently educated to
speculate on spiritual subjects. Mayavadis generally allege that the bhakti path is for women and
illiterates. This is a groundless accusation. The bhakti path is followed by the most learned scholars, such
as the Gosvamis, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramanujacarya. These are the actual followers of the
bhakti path. Regardless of whether or not one is educated or aristocratic, one must follow in their
footsteps. Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah: one must follow the path of the mahajanas. The mahajanas
are those who have taken to the path of devotional service (susilah sadhavo yatra narayana-parayanah),
for these great personalities are the perfect persons. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.18.12):
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
"One who has unflinching devotion to the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the
demigods." The less intelligent, however, misunderstand the bhakti path and therefore allege that it is for
one who cannot execute ritualistic ceremonies or speculate. As confirmed here by the word sadhricinah,
bhakti is the path that is appropriate, not the paths of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda. Mayavadis may be
susilah sadhavah (well-behaved saintly persons), but there is nevertheless some doubt about whether they
are actually making progress, for they have not accepted the path of bhakti. On the other hand, those who
follow the path of the acaryas are susilah and sadhavah, but furthermore their path is akuto-bhaya, which
means free from fear. One should fearlessly follow the twelve mahajanas and their line of disciplic
succession and thus be liberated from the clutches of maya.

My dear King, as a pot containing liquor cannot be purified even if washed in the waters of many rivers,
nondevotees cannot be purified by processes of atonement even if they perform them very well.
To take advantage of the methods of atonement, one must be at least somewhat devoted; otherwise
there is no chance of one's being purified. It is clear from this verse that even those who take advantage of
karma-kanda and jnana-kanda, but are not at least slightly devoted cannot be purified simply by following
these other paths. The word prayascittani is plural in number to indicate both karma-kanda and jnanakanda.
Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says, karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda. Thus
Narottama dasa Thakura compares the paths of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda to pots of poison. Liquor
and poison are in the same category. According to this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam, a person who has
heard a good deal about the path of devotional service, but who is not attached to it, who is not Krsna
conscious, is like a pot of liquor. Such a person cannot be purified without at least a slight touch of
devotional service.

and; tat--his; bhatan--order carriers; svapne api--even in dreams; pasyanti--see; hi--indeed; cirnaniskrtah--
who have performed the right type of atonement.
Although not having fully realized Krsna, persons who have even once surrendered completely unto His
lotus feet and who have become attracted to His name, form, qualities and pastimes are completely freed
of all sinful reactions, for they have thus accepted the true method of atonement. Even in dreams, such
surrendered souls do not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are equipped with ropes to bind the
sinful.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." This same principle is described here (sakrn manah krsna-padaravindayoh). If by studying
Bhagavad-gita one decides to surrender to Krsna, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions. It is
also significant that Sukadeva Gosvami, having several times repeated the words vasudeva-parayana and
narayana-parayana, finally says krsna-padaravindayoh. Thus he indicates that Krsna is the origin of both
Narayana and Vasudeva. Even though Narayana and Vasudeva are not different from Krsna, simply by
surrendering to Krsna one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as Narayana, Vasudeva and
Govinda. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram nanyat: "There is no truth superior to
Me." There are many names and forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is the supreme
form (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). Therefore Krsna recommends to neophyte devotees that one should
surrender unto Him only (mam ekam). Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of
Narayana, Vasudeva and Govinda are, Krsna directly says, mam ekam. Herein, this is also supported by
the word krsna-padaravindayoh. Narayana does not speak personally, but Krsna, or Vasudeva, does, as in
Bhagavad-gita for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-gita means to surrender unto
Krsna, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga.
Pariksit Maharaja had inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami how one can be saved from falling into the
various conditions of hellish life. In this verse Sukadeva Gosvami answers that a soul who has surrendered
to Krsna certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his
dreams he does not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if
one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to Krsna. The
word sakrt is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to Krsna once, he is saved
even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.30):
api cet su-duracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah
"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be
considered saintly because he is properly situated." If one never for a moment forgets Krsna, he is safe
even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts.
In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (2.40) the Lord also says:
nehabhikrama-naso 'sti
pratyavayo na vidyate
svalpam apy asya dharmasya
trayate mahato bhayat
"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one
from the most dangerous type of fear."
Elsewhere in the Gita (6.40) the Lord says, na hi kalyana-krt kascid durgatim tata gacchati: "one who
performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil." The highest kalyana (auspicious) activity is to
surrender to Krsna. That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life. Srila
Prabodhananda Sarasvati has confirmed this as follows:
kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto Krsna are compared to a snake with its poison fangs
removed (protkhata-damstrayate). Such a snake is no longer to be feared. Of course, one should not
commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to Krsna. However, even if one who has
surrendered to Krsna happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no
longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of Krsna very tightly and
serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free
from fear.

In this regard, learned scholars and saintly persons describe a very old historical incident involving a
discussion between the order carriers of Lord Visnu and those of Yamaraja. Please hear of this from me.
The Puranas, or old histories, are sometimes neglected by unintelligent men who consider their
descriptions mythological. Actually, the descriptions of the Puranas, or the old histories of the universe,
are factual, although not chronological. The puranas record the chief incidents that have occurred over
many millions of years, not only on this planet but also on other planets within the universe. Therefore all
learned and realized Vedic scholars speak with references to the incidents in the Puranas. Srila Rupa
Gosvami accepts the Puranas to be as important as the Vedas themselves. Therefore in Bhakti-rasamrtasindhu
he quotes the following verse from the Brahma-yamala:
sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-
vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, puranas
and Narada-pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society." A devotee of Krsna must refer
not only to the Vedas, but also to the puranas. One should not foolishly consider the Puranas
mythological. If they were mythological, Sukadeva Gosvami would not have taken the trouble to recite the
old historical incidents concerning the life of Ajamila. Now the history begins as follows.

kanya-kubje--in the city of Kanyakubja (Kanauj, a town near Kanpur); dvijah--brahmana; kascit--some;
dasi-patih--the husband of a low-class woman or prostitute; ajamilah--Ajamila; namna--by name; nastasat-
acarah--who lost all brahminical qualities; dasyah--of the prostitute or maidservant; samsargadusitah--
contaminated by the association.
In the city known as Kanyakubja there was a brahmana named Ajamila who married a prostitute
maidservant and lost all his brahminical qualities because of the association of that low-class woman.
The fault of illicit connection with women is that it makes one lose all brahminical qualities. In India
there is still a class of servants, called sudras, whose maidservant wives are called sudranis. Sometimes
people who are very lusty establish relationships with such maidservants and sweeping women, since in
the higher statuses of society they cannot indulge in the habit of woman hunting, which is strictly
prohibited by social convention. Ajamila, a qualified brahmana youth, lost all his brahminical qualities
because of his association with a prostitute, but he was ultimately saved because he had begun the process
of bhakti-yoga. Therefore in the previous verse, Sukadeva Gosvami spoke of the person who has only
once surrendered himself at the lotus feet of the Lord (manah krsna-padaravindayoh) or has just begun
the bhakti-yoga process. Bhakti-yoga begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh, hearing and chanting of
Lord Visnu's names, as in the maha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Chanting is the beginning of bhakti-yoga. Therefore Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu declares:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the
Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." The process of chanting the
holy name of the Lord is always superbly effective, but it is especially effective in this age of Kali. Its
practical effectiveness will now be explained by Sukadeva Gosvami through the history of Ajamila, who
was freed from the hands of the Yamadutas simply because of chanting the holy name of Narayana.
Pariksit Maharaja's original question was how to be freed from falling down into hell or into the hands of
the Yamadutas. In reply, Sukadeva Gosvami is citing this old historical example to convince Pariksit
Maharaja of the potency of bhakti-yoga, which begins simply with the chanting of the Lord's name. All the
great authorities of bhakti-yoga recommend the devotional process beginning with the chanting of the
holy name of Krsna (tan-nama-grahanadibhih).

This fallen brahmana, Ajamila, gave trouble to others by arresting them, by cheating them in gambling
or by directly plundering them. This was the way he earned his livelihood and maintained his wife and
children.
This verse indicates how degraded one becomes simply by indulging in illicit sex with a prostitute. Illicit
sex is not possible with a chaste or aristocratic woman, but only with unchaste sudras. The more society
allows prostitution and illicit sex, the more impetus it gives to cheaters, thieves, plunderers, drunkards
and gamblers. Therefore we first advise all the disciples in our Krsna consciousness movement to avoid
illicit sex, which is the beginning of all abominable life and which is followed by meat-eating, gambling
and intoxication, one after another. Of course, restraint is very difficult, but it is quite possible if one fully
surrenders to Krsna, since all these abominable habits gradually become distasteful for a Krsna conscious
person. If illicit sex is allowed to increase in a society, however, the entire society will be condemned, for
it will be full of rogues, thieves, cheaters and so forth.

That old man Ajamila had ten sons, of whom the youngest was a baby named Narayana. Since Narayana
was the youngest of all the sons, he was naturally very dear to both his father and his mother.
The word pravayasah indicates Ajamila's sinfulness because although he was eighty-eight years old, he
had a very young child. According to Vedic culture, one should leave home as soon as he has reached fifty
years of age; one should not live at home and go on producing children. Sex life is allowed for twenty-five
years, between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five or, at the most, fifty. After that one should give up
the habit of sex life and leave home as a vanaprastha and then properly take sannyasa. Ajamila, however,
because of his association with a prostitute, lost all brahminical culture and became most sinful, even in
his so-called household life.

Because of the child's broken language and awkward movements, old Ajamila was very much attached
to him. He always took care of the child and enjoyed the child's activities.
Here it is clearly mentioned that the child Narayana was so young that he could not even speak or walk
properly. Since the old man was very attached to the child, he enjoyed the child's activities, and because
the child's name was Narayana, the old man always chanted the holy name of Narayana. Although he was
referring to the small child and not to the original Narayana, the name of Narayana is so powerful that
even by chanting his son's name he was becoming purified (harer nama harer nama harer namaiva
kevalam). Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore declared that if one's mind is somehow or other attracted by
the holy name of Krsna (tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet), one is on the path of liberation.
It is customary in Hindu society for parents to give their children names like Krsnadasa, Govinda dasa,
Narayana dasa and Vrndavana dasa. Thus they chant the names Krsna, Govinda, Narayana and Vrndavana
and get the chance to be purified.

When Ajamila chewed food and ate it, he called the child to chew and eat, and when he drank he called
the child to drink also. Always engaged in taking care of the child and calling his name, Narayana,
Ajamila could not understand that his own time was now exhausted and that death was upon him.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is kind to the conditioned soul. Although this man completely
forgot Narayana, he was calling his child, saying, "Narayana, please come eat this food. Narayana, please
come drink this milk." Somehow or other, therefore, he was attached to the name Narayana. This is called
ajnata-sukrti. Although calling for his son, he was unknowingly chanting the name of Narayana, and the
holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so transcendentally powerful that his chanting was
being counted and recorded.

When the time of death arrived for the foolish Ajamila, he began thinking exclusively of his son
Narayana.
In the Second Canto of the Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.6) Sukadeva Gosvami says:
etavan sankhya-yogabhyam
svadharma-parinisthaya
janma-labhah parah pumsam
ante narayana-smrtih
"The highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by
acquirement of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of one's occupational duty, is to remember the
Personality of Godhead at the end of life." Somehow or other, Ajamila consciously or unconsciously
chanted the name of Narayana at the time of death (ante narayana-smrtih), and therefore he became allperfect
simply by concentrating his mind on the name of Narayana.
It may also be concluded that Ajamila, who was the son of a brahmana, was accustomed to worshiping
Narayana in his youth because in every brahmana's house there is worship of the narayana-sila. This
system is still present in India; in a rigid brahmana's house, there is narayana-seva, worship of Narayana.
Therefore, although the contaminated Ajamila was calling for his son, by concentrating his mind on the
holy name of Narayana he remembered the Narayana he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth.
In this regard Srila Sridhara Svami expressed his verdict as follows: etac ca tad-upalalanadi-sri-narayananamoccarana-
mahatmyena tad-bhaktir evabhud iti siddhantopayogitvenapi drastavyam. "According to the
bhakti-siddhanta, it is to be analyzed that because Ajamila constantly chanted his son's name, Narayana,
he was elevated to the platform of bhakti, although he did not know it." Similarly, Srila Viraraghava
Acarya gives this opinion: evam vartamanah sa dvijah mrtyu-kale upasthite satyajno narayanakhye putra
eva matim cakara matim asaktam akarod ity arthah. "Although at the time of death he was chanting the
name of his son, he nevertheless concentrated his mind upon the holy name of Narayana." Srila
Vijayadhvaja Tirtha gives a similar opinion:
mrtyu-kale deha-viyoga-laksana-kale mrtyoh sarva-dosa-papa-harasya harer anugrahat kale datta-jnanalaksane
upasthite hrdi prakasite tanaye purna-jnane bale panca-varsa-kalpe pradesa-matre narayanahvaye
murti-visese matim smarana-samartham cittam cakara bhaktyasmarad ity arthah.
Directly or indirectly, Ajamila factually remembered Narayana at the time of death (ante narayanasmrtih).

Ajamila then saw three awkward persons with deformed bodily features, fierce, twisted faces, and hair
standing erect on their bodies. With ropes in their hands, they had come to take him away to the abode of
Yamaraja. When he saw them he was extremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who
was playing a short distance away, Ajamila began to call him loudly by his name. Thus with tears in his
eyes he somehow or other chanted the holy name of Narayana.
A person who performs sinful activities performs them with his body, mind and words. Therefore three
order carriers from Yamaraja came to take Ajamila to Yamaraja's abode. Fortunately, even though he was
referring to his son, Ajamila chanted the four syllables of the hari-nama Narayana, and therefore the order
carriers of Narayana, the Visnudutas, also immediately arrived there. Because Ajamila was extremely
afraid of the ropes of Yamaraja, he chanted the Lord's name with tearful eyes. Actually, however, he never
meant to chant the holy name of Narayana; he meant to call his son.

My dear King, the order carriers of Visnu, the Visnudutas, immediately arrived when they heard the
holy name of their master from the mouth of the dying Ajamila, who had certainly chanted without
offense because he had chanted in complete anxiety.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks, hari-kirtanam nisamyapatan, katham-bhutasya bhartur
nama bruvatah: the order carriers of Lord Visnu came because Ajamila had chanted the holy name of
Narayana. They did not consider why he was chanting. While chanting the name of Narayana, Ajamila
was actually thinking of his son, but simply because they heard Ajamila chanting the Lord's name, the
order carriers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, immediately came for Ajamila's protection. Hari-kirtana is
actually meant to glorify the holy name, form, pastimes and qualities of the Lord. Ajamila, however, did
not glorify the form, qualities or paraphernalia of the Lord; he simply chanted the holy name.
Nevertheless, that chanting was sufficient to cleanse him of all sinful activities. As soon as the Visnudutas
heard their master's name being chanted, they immediately came. In this regard Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirtha
remarks: anena putra-sneham antarena pracinadrsta-balad udbhutaya bhaktya bhagavan-namasankirtanam
krtam iti jnayate. "Ajamila chanted the name of Narayana because of his excessive
attachment to his son. Nevertheless, because of his past good fortune in having rendered devotional
service to Narayana, he apparently chanted the holy name in full devotional service and without offenses."

Visnu; varayam asuh--forbade; ojasa--with resounding voices.
The order carriers of Yamaraja were snatching the soul from the core of the heart of Ajamila, the
husband of the prostitute, but with resounding voices the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas,
forbade them to do so.
A Vaisnava, one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu, is always protected by Lord
Visnu's order carriers. Because Ajamila had chanted the holy name of Narayana, the Visnudutas not only
immediately arrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamadutas not to touch him. By speaking
with resounding voices, the Visnudutas threatened to punish the Yamadutas if they continued trying to
snatch Ajamila's soul from his heart. The order carriers of Yamaraja have jurisdiction over all sinful living
entities, but the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, are capable of punishing anyone, including
Yamaraja, if he wrongs a Vaisnava.
Materialistic scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body with their material
instruments, but this verse clearly explains that the soul is within the core of the heart (hrdaya); it is from
the heart that the Yamadutas were extracting the soul of Ajamila. Similarly, we learn that the Supersoul,
Lord Visnu, is also situated within the heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). In the
Upanisads it is said that the Supersoul and the individual soul are living in the same tree of the body as
two friendly birds. The Supersoul is said to be friendly because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so
kind to the original soul that when the original soul transmigrates from one body to another, the Lord
goes with him. Furthermore, according to the desire and karma of the individual soul, the Lord, through
the agency of maya, creates another body for him.
The heart of the body is a mechanical arrangement. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." Yantra means a machine,
such as an automobile. The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its
director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One's body is
created through the agency of maya (karmana daiva-netrena), and according to one's activities in this life,
another vehicle is created, again under the supervision of daivi maya (daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya
duratyaya). At the appropriate time, one's next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul
and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration. During
transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamaraja and
put into a particular type of hellish life (naraka) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which
he will live in his next body.

When the order carriers of Yamaraja, the son of the sun-god, were thus forbidden, they replied: Who are

According to the sinful activities of Ajamila, he was within the jurisdiction of Yamaraja, the supreme
judge appointed to consider the sins of the living entities. When forbidden to touch Ajamila, the order
carriers of Yamaraja were surprised because they had never been hindered in the execution of their duty
by anyone within the three worlds.

Dear sirs, whose servants are you, where have you come from, and why are you forbidding us to touch
the body of Ajamila? Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the
best of devotees?
The most significant word used in this verse is siddha-sattamah, which means "the best of the perfect."
In Bhagavad-gita (7.3) it is said, manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye: out of millions of persons,
one may try to become siddha, perfect--or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that
he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aham brahmasmi). At the present moment practically everyone is
unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha.
When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the
devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sat-tama. One is then eligible to live in the
Vaikuntha planets or Krsnaloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee.
Since the Yamadutas are servants of Yamaraja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a
siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within
this material world. The Yamadutas therefore inquired why the Visnudutas were present where a sinful
man was going to die.
It should also be noted that Ajamila was not yet dead, for the Yamadutas were trying to snatch the soul
from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Ajamila was not yet dead. This will
be revealed in later verses. Ajamila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in
progress between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a
decision regarding who would claim the soul of Ajamila.

features and behavior and can thus understand his position. Therefore when the Yamadutas saw the
Visnudutas for the first time, they were surprised. They said, "By your bodily features you appear to be
very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this
material world with your own effulgences. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our
duty?" It will be explained that the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, mistakenly considered
Ajamila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified
by constantly chanting the holy name of Narayana. In other words, unless one is a Vaisnava, one cannot
understand the activities of a Vaisnava.
The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaikunthaloka are properly described in these verses.
The residents of Vaikuntha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms
holding various weapons. Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Visnu. They have the same bodily
features as Narayana because they have attained the liberation of sarupya, but they nevertheless act as
servants. All the residents of Vaikunthaloka know perfectly well that their master is Narayana, or Krsna,
and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who are nitya-mukta, everlastingly
liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves Narayana or Visnu, they never do so; they
always remain Krsna conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaikunthaloka.
Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord Krsna through the Krsna consciousness movement
will always remain in Vaikunthaloka and have nothing to do with the material world.

servants of Yamaraja, the supreme judge of religious principles, were unaware of the principles of
religious action. Thus the Visnudutas smiled, thinking, "What is this nonsense they are speaking? If they
are actually servants of Yamaraja they should know that Ajamila is not a suitable candidate for them to
carry off."

sri-visnudutah ucuh--the blessed messengers of Lord Visnu spoke; yuyam--all of you; vai--indeed;
dharma-rajasya--of King Yamaraja, who knows the religious principles; yadi--if; nirdesa-karinah--order
carriers; bruta--just speak; dharmasya--of religious principles; nah--unto us; tattvam--the truth; yat--that
which; ca--also; adharmasya--of impious activities; laksanam--symptoms.
The blessed messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, said: If you are actually servants of Yamaraja,
you must explain to us the meaning of religious principles and the symptoms of irreligion.
This inquiry by the Visnudutas to the Yamadutas is most important. A servant must know the
instructions of his master. The servants of Yamaraja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore
the Visnudutas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious
principles. A Vaisnava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the
instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." Therefore
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion. Those who have
surrendered to the principles of material nature instead of to Krsna are all impious, regardless of their
material position. Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to Krsna, and therefore
they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge. As Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." One who has not
surrendered to Krsna does not know the true principle of religion; otherwise he would have surrendered.
The question posed by the Visnudutas was very suitable. One who represents someone else must fully
know that person's mission. The devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement must therefore be fully
aware of the mission of Krsna and Lord Caitanya; otherwise they will be considered foolish. All devotees,
especially preachers, must know the philosophy of Krsna consciousness so as not to be embarrassed and
insulted when they preach.

What is the process of punishing others? Who are the actual candidates for punishment? Are all karmis
engaged in fruitive activities punishable, or only some of them?
One who has the power to punish others should not punish everyone. There are innumerable living
entities, the majority of whom are in the spiritual world and are nitya-mukta, everlastingly liberated.
There is no question of judging these liberated living beings. Only a small fraction of the living entities,
perhaps one fourth, are in the material world. And the major portion of the living entities in the material
world--8,000,000 of the 8,400,000 forms of life--are lower than human beings. They are not punishable,
for under the laws of material nature they are automatically evolving. Human beings, who are advanced in
consciousness, are responsible, but not all of them are punishable. Those engaged in advanced pious
activities are beyond punishment. Only those who engage in sinful activities are punishable. Therefore the
Visnudutas particularly inquired about who is punishable and why Yamaraja has been designated to
discriminate between who is punishable and who is not. How is one to be judged? What is the basic
principle of authority? These are the questions raised by the Visnudutas.

yamaduta ucuh
veda-pranihito dharmo
hy adharmas tad-viparyayah
vedo narayanah saksat
svayambhur iti susruma
yamadutah ucuh--the order carriers of Yamaraja said; veda--by the four Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Rg and
Atharva); pranihitah--prescribed; dharmah--religious principles; hi--indeed; adharmah--irreligious
principles; tat-viparyayah--the opposite of that (that which is not supported by Vedic injunctions);
vedah--the Vedas, books of knowledge; narayanah saksat--directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead
(being the words of Narayana); svayam-bhuh--self-born, self-sufficient (appearing only from the breath of
Narayana and not being learned from anyone else); iti--thus; susruma--we have heard.
The Yamadutas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious
principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Narayana, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamaraja.
The servants of Yamaraja replied quite properly. They did not manufacture principles of religion or
irreligion. Instead, they explained what they had heard from the authority Yamaraja. Mahajano yena gatah
sa panthah: one should follow the mahajana, the authorized person. Yamaraja is one of twelve authorities.
Therefore the servants of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, replied with perfect clarity when they said susruma
("we have heard"). The members of modern civilization manufacture defective religious principles
through speculative concoction. This is not dharma. They do not know what is dharma and what is
adharma. Therefore, as stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, dharmah projjhita-kaitavo 'tra:
dharma not supported by the Vedas is rejected from srimad-bhagavata-dharma. Bhagavata-dharma
comprises only that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavata-dharma is sarvadharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: one must accept the authority of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and surrender to Him and whatever He says. That is dharma. Arjuna, for example, thinking
that violence was adharma, was declining to fight, but Krsna urged him to fight. Arjuna abided by the
orders of Krsna, and therefore he is actually a dharmi because the order of Krsna is dharma. Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: "The real purpose of veda, knowledge, is to
know Me." One who knows Krsna perfectly is liberated. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One who
understands Krsna and abides by His order is a candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. It may be
concluded that dharma, religion, refers to that which is ordered in the Vedas, and adharma, irreligion,
refers to that which is not supported in the Vedas.
Dharma is not actually manufactured by Narayana. As stated in the Vedas, asya mahato bhutasya
nisvasitam etad yad rg-vedah iti: the injunctions of dharma emanate from the breathing of Narayana, the
supreme living entity. Narayana exists eternally and breathes eternally, and therefore dharma, the
injunctions of Narayana, also exist eternally. Srila Madhvacarya, the original acarya for those who belong
to the Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya, says:
vedanam prathamo vakta
harir eva yato vibhuh
ato visnv-atmaka veda
ity ahur veda-vadinah
The transcendental words of the Vedas emanated from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the Vedic principles should be understood to be Vaisnava principles because Visnu is
the origin of the Vedas. The Vedas contain nothing besides the instructions of Visnu, and one who follows
the Vedic principles is a Vaisnava. The Vaisnava is not a member of a manufactured community of this
material world. A Vaisnava is a real knower of the Vedas, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (vedais ca sarvair
aham eva vedyah).

yena--by whom (Narayana); sva-dhamni--although in His own place, the spiritual world; ami--all these;

(passion, goodness and ignorance); guna--qualities; nama--names; kriya--activities; rupaih--and with

The supreme cause of all causes, Narayana, is situated in His own abode in the spiritual world, but
nevertheless He controls the entire cosmic manifestation according to the three modes of material nature--
sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. In this way all living entities are awarded different qualities,
different names [such as brahmana, ksatriya and vaisya], different duties according to the varnasrama
institution, and different forms. Thus Narayana is the cause of the entire cosmic manifestation.
The Vedas inform us:
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8)
Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is almighty, omnipotent. He has multifarious energies,
and therefore He is able to remain in His own abode and without endeavor supervise and manipulate the
entire cosmic manifestation through the interaction of the three modes of material nature--sattva-guna,
rajo-guna and tamo-guna. These interactions create different forms, bodies, activities and changes, which
all occur perfectly. Because the Lord is perfect, everything works as if He were directly supervising and
taking part in it. Atheistic men, however, being covered by the three modes of material nature, cannot see
Narayana to be the supreme cause behind all activities. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.13):
tribhir gunamayair bhavair
ebhih sarvam idam jagat
mohitam nabhijanati
mam ebhyah param avyayam
"Deluded by the three modes, the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and
inexhaustible." Because unintelligent agnostics are mohita, illusioned by the three modes of material
nature, they cannot understand that Narayana, Krsna, is the supreme cause of all activities. As stated in
Brahma-samhita (5.1):
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes."

The sun, fire, sky, air, demigods, moon, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and Supersoul

The members of some religious sects, especially Christians, do not believe in the reactions of karma. We
once had a discussion with a learned Christian professor who argued that although people are generally
punished after the witnesses of their misdeeds are examined, where are the witnesses responsible for one's
suffering the reactions of past karma? To such a person the answer by the Yamadutas is given here. A
conditioned soul thinks that he is working stealthily and that no one can see his sinful activities, but we
can understand from the sastras that there are many witnesses, including the sun, fire, sky, air, moon,
demigods, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and the Supersoul Himself, who sits with the
individual soul within his heart. Where is the dearth of witnesses? The witnesses and the Supreme Lord
both exist, and therefore so many living entities are elevated to higher planetary systems or degraded to
lower planetary systems, including the hellish planets. There are no discrepancies, for everything is
arranged perfectly by the management of the Supreme God (svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca). The
witnesses mentioned in this verse are also mentioned in other Vedic literatures:

the three modes of nature and must act accordingly. One who has accepted a material body cannot be
inactive, and sinful action is inevitable for one acting under the modes of material nature. Therefore all
the living entities within this material world are punishable.
The difference between human beings and nonhuman beings is that a human is supposed to act
according to the direction of the Vedas. Unfortunately, men manufacture their own ways of acting,
without reference to the Vedas. Therefore all of them commit sinful actions and are punishable.

O best of the demigods, we can see three different varieties of life, which are due to the contamination
of the three modes of nature. The living entities are thus known as peaceful, restless and foolish; as happy,
unhappy or in-between; or as religious, irreligious and semireligious. We can deduce that in the next life
these three kinds of material nature will similarly act.
The actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature are visible in this life. For example,
some people are very happy, some are very distressed, and some are in mixed happiness and distress. This
is the result of past association with the modes of material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance. Since
these varieties are visible in this life, we may assume that the living entities, according to their association
with the different modes of material nature, will be happy, distressed or between the two in their next
lives also. Therefore the best policy is to disassociate oneself from the three modes of material nature and
be always transcendental to their contamination. This is possible only when one fully engages in the
devotional service of the Lord. As Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down under any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the spiritual platform." Unless one is fully
absorbed in the service of the Lord, one is subject to the contamination of the three modes of material
nature and must therefore suffer from distress or mixed happiness and distress.

As a sleeping person acts according to the body manifested in his dreams and accepts it to be himself, so
one identifies with his present body, which he acquired because of his past religious or irreligious actions,
and is unable to know his past or future lives.
A man engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he did in his past life to get his
present materially conditioned body, which is subjected to the threefold miseries. As stated by
Rsabhadeva in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.4), nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: a human being who is mad
after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully. Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: he performs sinful
actions simply for sense gratification. Na sadhu manye: this is not good. Yata atmano 'yam asann api
klesada asa dehah: because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which to suffer as he is
suffering in his present body because of his past sinful activities.
It should be understood that a person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance of
what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present and how he will suffer in the future. He is
completely in darkness. Therefore the Vedic injunction is, tamasi ma: "Don't remain in darkness." Jyotir
gama: "Try to go to the light." The light or illumination is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand
when he is elevated to the mode of goodness or when he transcends the mode of goodness by engaging in
devotional service to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord. This is described in the Svetasvatara
Upanisad (6.23):
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports
of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." The Vedas enjoin, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum
evabhigacchet: one must approach a spiritual master who has full knowledge of the Vedas and be
faithfully directed by him in order to become a devotee of the Lord. Then the knowledge of the Vedas will
be revealed. When the Vedic knowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of
material nature.
According to his association with the material modes of nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--a
living entity gets a particular type of body. The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness
is a qualified brahmana. Such a brahmana knows past, present and future because he consults the Vedic
literature and sees through the eyes of sastra (sastra-caksuh). He can understand what his past life was,
why be is in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches of maya and not accept
another material body. This is all possible when one is situated in the mode of goodness. Generally,
however, the living entities are engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance.
In any case, one receives an inferior or superior body at the discretion of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Paramatma. As stated in the previous verse:
manasaiva pure devah
purva-rupam vipasyati
anumimamsate 'purvam
manasa bhagavan ajah
Everything depends on bhagavan, or ajah, the unborn. Why doesn't one please Bhagavan to receive a
better body? The answer is ajnas tamasa: because of gross ignorance. One who is in complete darkness
cannot know what his past life was or what his next life will be; he is simply interested in his present
body. Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his
present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of
life and happiness is to eat as much as possible. A human being must be educated to understand his past
life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future. There is even a book, called Bhrgu-samhita,
which reveals information about one's past, present and future lives according to astrological calculations.
Somehow or other one must be enlightened about his past, present and future. One who is interested only
in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in
the mode of ignorance. His future is very, very dark. Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is
grossly covered by ignorance. Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance,
and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or
future.

pancabhih--with the five working senses (voice, arms, legs, anus and genitals); kurute--performs; svaarthan--
his desired interests; panca--the five objects of the senses (sound, form, touch, aroma and taste);
veda--knows; atha--thus; pancabhih--by the five senses of perception (hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting
and feeling); ekah--the one; tu--but; sodasena--by these fifteen items and the mind; trin--the three
categories of experience (happiness, distress and a mixture of both); svayam--he, the living entity himself;
saptadasah--the seventeenth item; asnute--enjoys.
Above the five senses of perception, the five working senses and the five objects of the senses is the
mind, which is the sixteenth element. Above the mind is the seventeenth element, the soul, the living
being himself, who, in cooperation with the other sixteen, enjoys the material world alone. The living
being enjoys three kinds of situations, namely happy, distressful and mixed.
Everyone engages in work with his hands, legs and other senses just to achieve a certain goal according
to his concocted ideas. One tries to enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma and
touch, not knowing the actual goal of life, which is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Because of disobeying the
Supreme Lord, one is put into material conditions, and he then tries to improve his situation in a
concocted way, not desiring to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself to instruct the bewildered living entity
how to act obediently and then gradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal,
peaceful life of bliss and knowledge. The living entity has a body, which is a very complicated
combination of the material elements, and with this body he struggles alone, as indicated in this verse by
the words ekas tu. For example, if one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone.
Although many other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care of himself because
no one else will help him. Therefore this verse indicates that the seventeenth item, the soul, must work
alone. Although he tries to create society, friendship and love, no one will be able to help him but Krsna,
the Supreme Lord. Therefore his only concern should be how to satisfy Krsna. That is also what Krsna
wants (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). People bewildered by material conditions try
to be united, but although they strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile.
Everyone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of nature. Therefore one's only hope,
as Krsna advises, is to surrender to Him, for He can help one become free from the ocean of nescience. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore prayed:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"O Krsna, beloved son of Nanda Maharaja, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have
fallen into this ocean of nescience, and although I am struggling very hard, there is no way I can save
myself. If You kindly pick me up and fix me as one of the particles of dust at Your lotus feet, that will save
me."
In a similar way, Bhaktivinoda Thakura sang:
anadi karama-phale, padi' bhavarnava-jale,
taribare na dekhi upaya
"My dear Lord, I cannot remember when I somehow or other fell into this ocean of nescience, and now
I can find no way to rescue myself." We should remember that everyone is responsible for his own life. If
an individual becomes a pure devotee of Krsna, he is then delivered from the ocean of nescience.

The subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts--the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five working
senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind. This subtle body is an effect of the three
modes of material nature. It is composed of insurmountably strong desires, and therefore it causes the
living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life, animal life and life as a demigod.
When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is certainly very jubilant, when he gets a human
body he is always in lamentation, and when he gets the body of an animal, he is always afraid. In all
conditions, however, he is actually miserable. His miserable condition is called samsrti, or transmigration
in material life.
The sum and substance of material conditional life is explained in this verse. The living entity, the
seventeenth element, is struggling alone, life after life. This struggle is called samsrti, or material
conditional life. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that the force of material nature is insurmountably strong
(daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya). Material nature harasses the living entity in different
bodies, but if the living entity surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes free from
this entanglement, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te). Thus
his life becomes successful.

Not a single living entity can remain unengaged even for a moment. One must act by his natural
tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this natural tendency forcibly makes
him work in a particular way.
The svabhavika, or one's natural tendency, is the most important factor in action. One's natural
tendency is to serve because a living entity is an eternal servant of God. The living entity wants to serve,
but because of his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord, he serves under the modes of
material nature and manufactures various modes of service, such as socialism, humanitarianism and
altruism. However, one should be enlightened in the tenets of Bhagavad-gita and accept the instruction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one give up all natural tendencies for material service under
different names and take to the service of the Lord. One's original natural tendency is to act in Krsna
consciousness because one's real nature is spiritual. The duty of a human being is to understand that since
he is essentially spirit, he must abide by the spiritual tendency and not be carried away by material
tendencies. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung:
(miche) mayara vase, yaccha bhese',
khaccha habudubu, bhai
"My dear brothers, you are being carried away by the waves of material energy and are suffering in many
miserable conditions. Sometimes you are drowning in the waves of material nature, and sometimes you
are tossed like a swimmer struggling in the ocean." As confirmed by Bhaktivinoda Thakura, this tendency
to be battered by the waves of maya can be changed to one's original, natural tendency, which is spiritual,
when the living entity comes to understand that he is eternally krsna-dasa, a servant of God, Krsna.
(jiva) krsna-dasa, ei visvasa,
karle ta' ara duhkha nai
If instead of serving maya under different names, one turns his service attitude toward the Supreme
Lord, he is then safe, and there is no more difficulty. If one returns to his original, natural tendency in the
human form of life by understanding the perfect knowledge given by Krsna Himself in the Vedic
literature, one's life is successful.

labdhva--having gotten; nimittam--the cause; avyaktam--unseen or unknown to the person; vyaktaavyaktam--

uta--certainly; yatha-yoni--exactly like the mother; yatha-bijam--exactly like the father; sva-bhavena--by
the natural tendency; baliyasa--which is very powerful.
The fruitive activities a living being performs, whether pious or impious, are the unseen cause for the
fulfillment of his desires. This unseen cause is the root for the living entity's different bodies. Because of
his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a particular family and receives a body which is either
like that of his mother or like that of his father. The gross and subtle bodies are created according to his
desire.
The gross body is a product of the subtle body. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.6):
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail."
The atmosphere of the subtle body at the time of death is created by the activities of the gross body. Thus
the gross body acts during one's lifetime, and the subtle body acts at the time of death. The subtle body,
which is called linga, the body of desire, is the background for the development of a particular type of
gross body, which is either like that of one's mother or like that of one's father. According to the Rg Veda,
if at the time of sex the secretions of the mother are more profuse than those of the father, the child will
receive a female body, and if the secretions of the father are more profuse than those of the mother, the
child will receive a male body. These are the subtle laws of nature, which act according to the desire of the
living entity. If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by developing a consciousness of Krsna,
at the time of death the subtle body will create a gross body in which he will be a devotee of Krsna, or if
he is still more perfect, he will not take another material body but will immediately get a spiritual body
and thus return home, back to Godhead. This is the process of the transmigration of the soul. Therefore
instead of trying to unite human society through pacts for sense gratification that can never be achieved, it
is clearly desirable to teach people how to become Krsna conscious and return home, back to Godhead.
This is true now and, indeed, at any time.

position; eva--indeed; na--not; cirat--taking a long time; isa-sangat--from the association of the Supreme

Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the
human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee,
this position can be overcome.
The word prakrti means material nature, and purusa may also refer to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with prakrti, the female energy of Krsna, and be
separated from Krsna by the illusion that he is able to enjoy prakrti, he must continue in his conditional
life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (purusam
sasvatam), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah: one must simply understand the
Supreme Person, Krsna, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes. This will keep one always in
the association of Krsna. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so'rjuna: thus after giving up his gross
material body, one accepts not another gross body but a spiritual body in which to return home, back to
Godhead. Thus one ends the tribulation caused by his association with the material energy. In summary,
the living entity is an eternal servant of God, but he comes to the material world and is bound by material
conditions because of his desire to lord it over matter. Liberation means giving up this false consciousness
and reviving one's original service to the Lord. This return to one's original life is called mukti, as
confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih).

In the beginning this brahmana named Ajamila studied all the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of
good character, good conduct and good qualities. Firmly established in executing all the Vedic
injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control. Furthermore, he
was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Ajamila was
very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire-god, guests, and the elderly members of his household.
Indeed, he was free from false prestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved.
He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.
The order carriers of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety
and how a living entity is entangled in this material world. Describing the history of Ajamila's life, the
Yamadutas relate that in the beginning he was a learned scholar of the Vedic literature. He was well
behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone. In fact, he had all good qualities. In other words, he
was like a perfect brahmana. A brahmana is expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative
principles and to have all good qualities. The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses. Srila
Viraraghava Acarya comments that dhrta-vrata means dhrtam vratam stri-sanga-rahityatmakabrahmacarya-
rupam. In other words, Ajamila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfect
brahmacari and was very softhearted, truthful, clean and pure. How he fell down in spite of all these
qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamaraja will be described in the following
verses.

Once this brahmana Ajamila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers
and two kinds of grass, called samit and kusa. On the way home, he came upon a sudra, a very lusty,
fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The sudra was smiling,
singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the sudra and the prostitute were drunk. The
prostitute's eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in
which Ajamila saw them.
While traveling along the public way, Ajamila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are
vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very
frequently. In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world
have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken sudra and the prostitute,
Ajamila, who was a perfect brahmacari, was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and
we must consider the position of a brahmacari student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmacari to
remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles.
Nevertheless, if one takes to Krsna consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created
by sin. In our Krsna consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and
gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight,
especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult.
Nevertheless, if by the grace of Krsna one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare Krsna
mantra, Krsna will certainly protect him. Indeed, Krsna says that His devotee is never vanquished
(kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). Therefore all the disciples practicing Krsna
consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy
name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one's position is very dangerous, especially in
this Kali-yuga.

As far as possible he patiently tried to remember the instructions of the sastras not even to see a woman.
With the help of this knowledge and his intellect, he tried to control his lusty desires, but because of the

Unless one is very strong in knowledge, patience and proper bodily, mental and intellectual behavior,
controlling one's lusty desires is extremely difficult. Thus after seeing a man embracing a young woman
and practically doing everything required for sex life, even a fully qualified brahmana, as described above,
could not control his lusty desires and restrain himself from pursuing them. Because of the force of
materialistic life, to maintain self-control is extremely difficult unless one is specifically under the
protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service.

In the same way that the sun and moon are eclipsed by a low planet, the brahmana lost all his good
sense. Taking advantage of this situation, he always thought of the prostitute, and within a short time he
took her as a servant in his house and abandoned all the regulative principles of a brahmana.
By speaking this verse, Sukadeva Gosvami wants to impress upon the mind of the reader that Ajamila's
exalted position as a brahmana was vanquished by his association with the prostitute, so much so that he
forgot all his brahminical activities. Nevertheless, at the end of his life, by chanting the four syllables of
the name Narayana, he was saved from the gravest danger of falling down. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya
trayate mahato bhayat: even a little devotional service can save one from the greatest danger. Devotional
service, which begins with chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is so powerful that even if one falls
down from the exalted position of a brahmana through sexual indulgence, he can be saved from all
calamities if he somehow or other chants the holy name of the Lord. This is the extraordinary power of
the Lord's holy name. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita it is advised that one not forget the chanting of the holy
name even for a moment (satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah). There are so many dangers
in this material world that one may fall down from an exalted position at any time. Yet if one keeps
himself always pure and steady by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, he will be safe without a doubt.

Thus Ajamila began spending whatever money he had inherited from his father to satisfy the prostitute
with various material presentations so that she would remain pleased with him. He gave up all his
brahminical activities to satisfy the prostitute.
There are many instances throughout the world in which even a purified person, being attracted by a
prostitute, spends all the money he has inherited. Prostitute hunting is so abominable that the desire for
sex with a prostitute can ruin one's character, destroy one's exalted position and plunder all one's money.
Therefore illicit sex is strictly prohibited. One should be satisfied with his married wife, for even a slight
deviation will create havoc. A Krsna conscious grhastha should always remember this. He should always
be satisfied with one wife and be peaceful simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Otherwise at any
moment he may fall down from his good position, as exemplified in the case of Ajamila.

Customarily everyone is eligible to inherit his father's property, and Ajamila also inherited the money of
his father. But what did he do with the money? Instead of engaging the money in the service of Krsna, he
engaged it in the service of a prostitute. Therefore he was condemned and was punishable by Yamaraja.
How did this happen? He was victimized by the dangerous lustful glance of a prostitute.

who has not undergone atonement; yatra--where; dandena--by punishment; suddhyati--he will

This man Ajamila did not undergo atonement. Therefore because of his sinful life, we must take him
into the presence of Yamaraja for punishment. There, according to the extent of his sinful acts, he will be
punished and thus purified.
The Visnudutas had forbidden the Yamadutas to take Ajamila to Yamaraja, and therefore the Yamadutas
explained that taking such a man to Yamaraja was appropriate. Since Ajamila had not undergone
atonement for his sinful acts, he was to be taken to Yamaraja to be purified. When a man commits murder
he becomes sinful, and therefore he also must be killed; otherwise after death he must suffer many sinful
reactions. Similarly, punishment by Yamaraja is a process of purification for the most abominable sinful
persons. Therefore the Yamadutas requested the Visnudutas not to obstruct their taking Ajamila to
Yamaraja.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The History of the Life of Ajamila."
Chapter Two
Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas
In this chapter the messengers from Vaikuntha explain to the Yamadutas the glories of chanting the
holy name of the Lord. The Visnudutas said, "Now impious acts are being performed even in an assembly
of devotees, for a person who is not punishable is going to be punished in the assembly of Yamaraja. The
mass of people are helpless and must depend upon the government for their safety and security, but if the
government takes advantage of this to harm the citizens, where will they go? We see perfectly that
Ajamila should not be punished, although you are attempting to take him to Yamaraja for punishment."
It was due to Ajamila's glorifying the holy name of the Supreme Lord that he was not punishable. The
Visnudutas explained this as follows: "Simply by once chanting the holy name of Narayana, this
brahmana has become free from the reactions of sinful life. Indeed, he has been freed not only from the
sins of this life, but from the sins of many, many thousands of other lives. He has already undergone true
atonement for all his sinful actions. If one atones according to the directions of the sastras, one does not
actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of
such chanting can immediately free one from all sins. Chanting the glories of the Lord's holy name
awakens all good fortune. Therefore there is no doubt that Ajamila, being completely free from all sinful
reactions, should not be punished by Yamaraja."
As they were saying this, the Visnudutas released Ajamila from the ropes of the Yamadutas and left for
their own abode. The brahmana Ajamila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Visnudutas. He
could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of Narayana at the end of his life.
Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune. Having thoroughly understood the
discussion between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned
himself again and again.
Finally, because of his association with the Visnudutas, Ajamila, his original consciousness aroused,
gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation,
always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the Visnudutas went there, seated him on a
golden throne and took him away to Vaikunthaloka.
In summary, although the sinful Ajamila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord Narayana, even
though chanted in the preliminary stage, namabhasa, was able to give him liberation. Therefore one who
chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted. He is protected even in his
material, conditional life.

assembly; yatra--wherein; adandyesu--upon persons not to be punished; apapesu--who are sinless;

The Visnudutas said: Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where
religion should be maintained. Indeed, those in charge of maintaining the religious principles are
needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.
The Visnudutas accused the Yamadutas of violating the religious principles by attempting to drag
Ajamila to Yamaraja for punishment. Yamaraja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However,
if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamaraja is contaminated. This principle
applies not only in the assembly of Yamaraja, but throughout human society also.
In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king's court or the
government. Unfortunately, in this yuga, Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the
government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if
one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that
magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the Krsna
consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and
courts. The Visnudutas, who are Vaisnavas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their
spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vaisnavas go out to preach according to the standard method
of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vaisnavas who have
dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts
on false charges of disturbing the peace.

A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and
protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and
instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamaraja does this, for
he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons
become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the
citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?
The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching
them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one's self and
one's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life.
The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a
gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship
with God. This principle was followed by kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Maharaja Pariksit, Lord
Ramacandra, Maharaja Ambarisa and Prahlada Maharaja. The leaders of the government must be very
honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer. Unfortunately, in the name of
democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the
government. Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and
dragged down from his post by the citizens. This is only one case, but there are many others. Because of
the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement, people should be Krsna conscious and should not
vote for anyone who is not Krsna conscious. Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state.
When a Vaisnava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries
his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare Krsna movement.

Although Ajamila was not punishable, the Yamadutas were insisting on taking him away to Yamaraja for
punishment. This was adharma, contrary to religious principles. The Visnudutas feared that if such
irreligious acts were allowed, the management of human society would be spoiled. In modern times, the
Krsna consciousness movement is trying to introduce the right principles of management for human
society, but unfortunately the governments of Kali-yuga do not properly support the Hare Krsna
movement because they do not appreciate its valuable service. The Hare Krsna movement is the right
movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public
leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity's sinful
condition.

People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and
irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head
on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master's protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted
and deserves to be the object of a living entity's faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has
fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?
The Sanskrit word visvasta-ghata refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust. The mass of
people should always feel security because of the government's protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is
for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons.
We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together
peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the
Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In this age, animals are
kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon
as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vaisnavas
like the Visnudutas. Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for
such suffering. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith,
whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now
go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age
are therefore described as mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah. As a consequence of
such sinfulness, men are condemned (mandah), their intelligence is unclear (sumanda-matayah), they are
unfortunate (manda-bhagyah), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (upadrutah).
This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions.

Ajamila has already atoned for all his sinful actions. Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed
in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy
name of Narayana. Even though he did not chant purely, he chanted without offense, and therefore he is
now pure and eligible for liberation.
The Yamadutas had considered only the external situation of Ajamila. Since he was extremely sinful
throughout his life, they thought he should be taken to Yamaraja and did not know that he had become
free from the reactions of all his sins. The Visnudutas therefore instructed that because he had chanted
the four syllables of the name Narayana at the time of his death, he was freed from all sinful reactions. In
this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following verses from the smrti-sastra:
namno hi yavati saktih
papa-nirharane hareh
tavat kartum na saknoti
patakam pataki narah
"Simply by chanting one holy name of Hari, a sinful man can counteract the reactions to more sins than
he is able to commit." (Brhad-visnu Purana)
avasenapi yan-namni
kirtite sarva-patakaih
puman vimucyate sadyah
simha-trastair mrgair iva
"If one chants the holy name of the Lord, even in a helpless condition or without desiring to do so, all
the reactions of his sinful life depart, just as when a lion roars, all the small animals flee in fear." (Garuda
Purana)
sakrd uccaritam yena
harir ity aksara-dvayam
baddha-parikaras tena
moksaya gamanam prati
"By once chanting the holy name of the Lord, which consists of the two syllables ha-ri, one guarantees
his path to liberation." (Skanda Purana)
These are some of the reasons why the Visnudutas objected to the Yamadutas' taking Ajamila to the
court of Yamaraja.

The Visnudutas continued: Even previously, while eating and at other times, this Ajamila would call his
son, saying, "My dear Narayana, please come here." Although calling the name of his son, he nevertheless
uttered the four syllables na-ra-ya-na. Simply by chanting the name of Narayana in this way, he
sufficiently atoned for the sinful reactions of millions of lives.
Previously, when engaged in sinful activities to maintain his family, Ajamila chanted the name of
Narayana without offenses. To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one's sinful activities, or
to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (namno balad yasya hi
papa-buddhih). But although Ajamila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of
Narayana to counteract them; he simply chanted the name Narayana to call his son. Therefore his
chanting was effective. Because of chanting the holy name of Narayana in this way, he had already
vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives. In the beginning he was pure, but
although he later committed many sinful acts, he was offenseless because he did not chant the holy name
of Narayana to counteract them. One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is
always pure. As confirmed in this verse Ajamila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of
Narayana he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.

atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all
other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu, such sinful persons may attract the
attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers, "Because this man has chanted My holy name,

By following the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or undergoing atonement, sinful men do not become as
purified as by chanting once the holy name of Lord Hari. Although ritualistic atonement may free one
from sinful reactions, it does not awaken devotional service, unlike the chanting of the Lord's names,
which reminds one of the Lord's fame, qualities, attributes, pastimes and paraphernalia.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that the chanting of the holy name of the Lord has
special significance that distinguishes it from the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement for severe,
more severe or most severe sinful actions. There are twenty types of religious scriptures called dharmasastras,
beginning with the Manu-samhita and parasara-samhita, but herein it is stressed that although one
may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of
these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord. On the other
hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of
the greatest sins, but also raises one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is described as uttamasloka because He is famous for His glorious activities. Thus one
serves the Lord by remembering His form, His attributes and pastimes. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura explains that this is all possible simply by chanting the Lord's holy name because of the Lord's
omnipotence. What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can be easily achieved
through the chanting of the Lord's holy name. To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy and
sublime that one can achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process. Therefore
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu declares, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam: "All glories to Sri Krsna
sankirtana!" The sankirtana movement we have started offers the best process for becoming purified of all
sinful reactions and coming immediately to the platform of spiritual life.

The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to
cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one's mind again runs toward material activities.
Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting
of the Hare Krsna mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as
the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one's heart
completely.
The statements in this verse have been confirmed previously in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted." It is the
special mercy of the Supreme Lord that as soon as He knows that one is glorifying His name, fame and
attributes, He personally helps cleanse the dirt from one's heart. Therefore simply by such glorification
one not only becomes purified, but also achieves the results of pious activities (punya-sravana-kirtana).
Punya-sravana-kirtana refers to the process of devotional service. Even if one does not understand the
meaning of the Lord's name, pastimes or attributes, one is purified simply by hearing or chanting of them.
Such purification is called sattva-bhavana.
One's main purpose in human life should be to purify his existence and achieve liberation. As long as
one has a material body, one is understood to be impure. In such an impure, material condition, one
cannot enjoy a truly blissful life, although everyone seeks it. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.1) says,
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyet: one must perform tapasya, austerity, to purify his existence
in order to come to the spiritual platform. The tapasya of chanting and glorifying the name, fame and
attributes of the Lord is a very easy purifying process by which everyone can be happy. Therefore
everyone who desires the ultimate cleansing of his heart must adopt this process. Other processes, such as
karma, jnana and yoga, cannot cleanse the heart absolutely.

Narayana. That chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life. Therefore, O
servants of Yamaraja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish conditions.
The Visnudutas, who are superior authorities, gave orders to the Yamadutas, who did not know that
Ajamila was no longer subject to tribulation in hellish life for his past sins. Although he had chanted the
holy name Narayana to indicate his son, the holy name is so transcendentally powerful that he was
automatically freed because he had chanted the holy name while dying (ante narayana-smrtih). As Krsna
confirms in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." Unless one is freed from all sinful reactions, one cannot be promoted to the platform of
devotional service. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (8.5) it is stated:
anta-kale ca mam eva
smaran muktva kalevaram
yah prayati sa mad-bhavam
yati nasty atra samsayah
If one remembers Krsna, Narayana, at the time of death, one is certainly eligible to return immediately
home, back to Godhead.

absolved from having to enter hellish life, even though he is sinful.

yam yam vapi smaran bhavam

"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail."
If one practices chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, he is naturally expected to chant Hare Krsna when he
meets with some accident. Even without such practice, however, if one somehow or other chants the holy
name of the Lord (Hare Krsna) when he meets with an accident and dies, he will be saved from hellish life

Authorities who are learned scholars and sages have carefully ascertained that one should atone for the
heaviest sins by undergoing a heavy process of atonement and one should atone for lighter sins by
undergoing lighter atonement. Chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, however, vanquishes all the effects of
sinful activities, regardless of whether heavy or light.
In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes an incident that took place when Samba
was rescued from the punishment of the Kauravas. Samba fell in love with the daughter of Duryodhana,
and since according to ksatriya custom one is not offered a ksatriya's daughter unless he displays his
chivalrous valor, Samba abducted her. Consequently Samba was arrested by the Kauravas. Later, when
Lord Balarama came to rescue him, there was an argument about Samba's release. Since the argument was
not settled, Balarama showed His power in such a way that all of Hastinapura trembled and would have
been vanquished as if by a great earthquake. Then the matter was settled, and Samba married
Duryodhana's daughter. The purport is that one should take shelter of Krsna-Balarama, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, whose protective power is so great that it cannot be equaled in the material
world. However powerful the reactions of one's sins, they will immediately be vanquished if one chants
the name of Hari, Krsna, Balarama or Narayana.

Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows and other such

As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.42), bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: devotional
service is so powerful that one who performs devotional service is immediately freed from all sinful
desires. All desires within this material world are sinful because material desire means sense gratification,
which always involves action that is more or less sinful. Pure bhakti, however, is anyabhilasita-sunya; in
other words, it is free from material desires, which result from karma and jnana. One who is situated in
devotional service no longer has material desires, and therefore he is beyond sinful life. Material desires
should be completely stopped. Otherwise, although one's austerities, penances and charity may free one
from sin for the time being, one's desires will reappear because his heart is impure. Thus he will act
sinfully and suffer.

Lord, if one chants knowingly or unknowingly, the chanting will be very effective.
In the Western countries, where the Hare Krsna movement is spreading, learned scholars and other
thoughtful men are realizing its effectiveness. For example, Dr. J. Stillson Judah, a learned scholar, has
been very much attracted to this movement because he has actually seen that it is turning hippies addicted
to drugs into pure Vaisnavas who voluntarily become servants of Krsna and humanity. Even a few years
ago, such hippies did not know the Hare Krsna mantra, but now they are chanting it and becoming pure
Vaisnavas. Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meateating
and gambling. This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare Krsna movement, which is
supported in this verse. One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, but if
one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine
will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.

conditioned souls to their senses. Those who are fortunate like Ajamila are saved by the Visnudutas, or

O sinless Maharaja Pariksit, the order carriers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Visnudutas,
saw that Ajamila was attempting to say something, and thus they suddenly disappeared from his presence.
The sastras say:

apathya-bhojanas tesam
akale maranam dhruvam
"For persons who are papistha, very sinful, and duracara, misbehaved or very unclean in their habits,
who are against the existence of God, who disrespect Vaisnavas and brahmanas, and who eat anything
and everything, untimely death is sure." It is said that in Kali-yuga one has a maximum lifetime of one
hundred years, but as people become degraded, the duration of their lives decreases (prayenalpayusah).
Because Ajamila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to
have died immediately. When the Visnudutas saw Ajamila trying to say something to them, they
disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord. Since all his sinful reactions had been
vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is
completely free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." The Visnudutas made Ajamila aware of devotional service so that He might immediately
become fit to return home, back to Godhead. To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they
disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of
the Lord is very intense.

After hearing the discourses between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, Ajamila could understand the
religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature. These principles are mentioned in
the three Vedas. He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the
modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, Ajamila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities and
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee. He could then
remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.
In Bhagavad-gita (2.45) Lord Krsna told Arjuna:
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the Self." The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising
to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his
being elevated to spiritual life. Krsna therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the
process of transcendental religion. The transcendental position of devotional service is also confirmed in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6). Sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje. Bhakti, devotional
service, is paro dharmah, transcendental dharma; it is not material dharma. People generally think that
religion should be pursued for material profit. This may be suitable for persons interested in material life,
but one who is interested in spiritual life should be attached to paro dharmah, the religious principles by
which one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord (yato bhaktir adhoksaje). The bhagavata religion
teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to
surrender to the Lord. When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from
impediments and completely satisfied (ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati). Having been elevated to
that platform, Ajamila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form
and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Ajamila said: Alas, being a servant of my senses, how degraded I became! I fell down from my position
as a duly qualified brahmana and begot children in the womb of a prostitute.
The men of the higher classes--the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas--do not beget children in the
wombs of lower-class women. Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a
girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable. Vedic astrology
reveals whether one has been born in the vipra-varna, ksatriya-varna, vaisya-varna or sudra-varna,
according to the three qualities of material nature. This must be examined because a marriage between a
boy of the vipra-varna and a girl of the sudra-varna is incompatible; married life would be miserable for
both husband and wife. Consequently a boy should marry a girl of the same category. Of course, this is
trai-gunya, a material calculation according to the Vedas, but if the boy and girl are devotees there need be
no such considerations. A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the
boy and girl form a very happy combination.

This is the mentality of one who is becoming a pure devotee. When one is elevated to the platform of
devotional service by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master, one first regrets his past sinful
activities. This helps one advance in spiritual life. The Visnudutas had given Ajamila the chance to
become a pure devotee, and the duty of a pure devotee is to regret his past sinful activities in illicit sex,
intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. Not only should one give up his past bad habits, but he must
always regret his past sinful acts. This is the standard of pure devotion.

"Association with devotees is recommended by all the sastras because by even a moment of such

very pure, and he associated with devotees and brahmanas; because of that pious activity, even though he
was fallen, he was inspired to name his son Narayana. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from
within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham
hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." The Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart, is so kind that
if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave
Ajamila the opportunity to name his youngest son Narayana so that in affection he would constantly call
"Narayana! Narayana!" and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of
his death. Such is the mercy of Krsna. Guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija: by the mercy of the guru
and Krsna, one receives the seed of bhakti. This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our
Krsna consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee's name to a form that reminds him of
Visnu. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as Krsnadasa or Govinda
dasa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is
essential. The Krsna consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to
remember Krsna somehow or other.

Were it not for my past devotional service, how could I, a most unclean keeper of a prostitute, have
gotten an opportunity to chant the holy name of Vaikunthapati when I was just ready to die? Certainly it
could not have been possible.
The name Vaikunthapati, which means "the master of the spiritual world," is not different from the
name Vaikuntha. Ajamila, who was now a realized soul, could understand that because of his past
spiritual activities in devotional service, he had gotten this opportunity to chant the holy name of
Vaikunthapati in his horrible condition at the time of death.

Those engaged in broadcasting the holy name of Narayana, Krsna, through the Krsna consciousness
movement should always consider what our position was before we came and what it is now. We had
fallen into abominable lives as meat-eaters, drunkards and woman hunters who performed all kinds of
sinful activities, but now we have been given the opportunity to chant the Hare Krsna mantra. Therefore
we should always appreciate this opportunity. By the grace of the Lord we are opening many branches,
and we should use this good fortune to chant the holy name of the Lord and serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead directly. We must be conscious of the difference between our present and past
conditions and should always be very careful not to fall from the most exalted life.

Because of identifying oneself with the body, one is subjected to desires for sense gratification, and thus
one engages in many different types of pious and impious action. This is what constitutes material
bondage. Now I shall disentangle myself from my material bondage, which has been caused by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead's illusory energy in the form of a woman. Being a most fallen soul, I was
victimized by the illusory energy and have become like a dancing dog led around by a woman's hand.
Now I shall give up all lusty desires and free myself from this illusion. I shall become a merciful, wellwishing
friend to all living entities and always absorb myself in Krsna consciousness.
This should be the standard of determination for all Krsna conscious persons. A Krsna conscious person
should free himself from the clutches of maya, and he should also be compassionate to all others suffering
in those clutches. The activities of the Krsna consciousness movement are meant not only for oneself but
for others also. This is the perfection of Krsna consciousness. One who is interested in his own salvation
is not as advanced in Krsna consciousness as one who feels compassion for others and who therefore
propagates the Krsna consciousness movement. Such an advanced devotee will never fall down, for Krsna
will give him special protection. That is the sum and substance of the Krsna consciousness movement.
Everyone is like a play toy in the hands of the illusory energy and is acting as she moves him. One should
come to Krsna consciousness to release oneself and also to release others.

Simply because I chanted the holy name of the Lord in the association of devotees, my heart is now
becoming purified. Therefore I shall not fall victim again to the false lures of material sense gratification.
Now that I have become fixed in the Absolute Truth, henceforward I shall not identify myself with the
body. I shall give up false conceptions of "I" and "mine" and fix my mind on the lotus feet of Krsna.
How a living entity becomes a victim of the material condition is lucidly explained in this verse. The
beginning is to misidentify the body as one's self. Therefore Bhagavad-gita begins with the spiritual
instruction that one is not the body, but is within the body. This consciousness can be possible only if one
chants the holy name of Krsna, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, and always keeps oneself in the association
of devotees. This is the secret of success. Therefore we stress that one should chant the holy name of the
Lord and keep oneself free from the contaminations of this material world, especially the contaminations
of lusty desires for illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. With determination, one should
vow to follow these principles and thus be saved from the miserable condition of material existence. The
first necessity is to become freed from the bodily concept of life.

Because of a moment's association with devotees [the Visnudutas], Ajamila detached himself from the
material conception of life with determination. Thus freed from all material attraction, he immediately
started for Hardwar.
The word mukta-sarvanubandhanah indicates that after this incident, Ajamila, not caring for his wife
and children, went straight to Hardwar for further advancement in his spiritual life. Our Krsna
consciousness movement now has centers in Vrndavana and Navadvipa so that those who want to live a
retired life, whether they be devotees or not, can go there and with determination give up the bodily
concept of life. One is welcome to live in those holy places for the rest of his life in order to achieve the
highest success by the very simple method of chanting the holy name of the Lord and taking prasada.
Thus one may return home, back to Godhead. We do not have a center in Hardwar, but Vrndavana and
Sridhama Mayapur are better for devotees than any other places. The Caitanya Candrodaya temple offers
one a good opportunity to associate with devotees. Let us all take advantage of this opportunity.

Ajamila fully engaged in devotional service. Thus he detached his mind from the process of sense
gratification and became fully absorbed in thinking of the form of the Lord.
If one worships the Deity in the temple, one's mind will naturally be absorbed in thought of the Lord
and His form. There is no distinction between the form of the Lord and the Lord Himself. Therefore
bhakti-yoga is the most easy system of yoga. Yogis try to concentrate their minds upon the form of the
Supersoul, Visnu, within the heart, but this same objective is easily achieved when one's mind is absorbed
in the Deity worshiped in the temple. In every temple there is a transcendental form of the Lord, and one
may easily think of this form. By seeing the Lord during arati, by offering bhoga and by constantly
thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class yogi. This is the best process of yoga, as
confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." The first-class yogi is he who
controls his senses and detaches himself from material activities by always thinking of the form of the
Lord.

the form of the Lord. The Visnudutas had gone away for some time to give Ajamila a chance to become
firmly fixed in meditation upon the Lord. Now that his devotion had matured, they returned to take him.
Understanding that the same Visnudutas had returned, Ajamila offered them his obeisances by bowing

Upon seeing the Visnudutas, Ajamila gave up his material body at Hardwar on the bank of the Ganges.

"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
The result of perfection in Krsna consciousness is that after giving up one's material body, one is
immediately transferred to the spiritual world in one's original spiritual body to become an associate of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Some devotees go to Vaikunthaloka, and others go to Goloka
Vrndavana to become associates of Krsna.

For many years, material scientists have tried to go to the moon, but they are still unable to go there.
However, the spiritual airplanes from the spiritual planets can take one back home, back to Godhead, in a
second. The speed of such a spiritual plane can only be imagined. Spirit is finer than the mind, and
everyone has experience of how swiftly the mind travels from one place to another. Therefore one can
imagine the swiftness of the spiritual form by comparing it to the speed of the mind. In less than even a
moment, a perfect devotee can return home, back to Godhead, immediately after giving up his material
body.

Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and
glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the
holy places stand. One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement,
speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one
takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of
nature, namely passion and ignorance.
It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many karmis, jnanis and yogis
become attached to material activities again. Many so-called svamis and yogis give up material activities as
false (jagan mithya), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals
and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in
politics, although still falsely declaring themselves sannyasis, members of the renounced order. The
perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to
devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh: chanting and hearing the glories of the
Lord. The Krsna consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young
boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up,
abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as
they joined the Krsna consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of
atonement for actions performed in rajah and tamah (passion and ignorance). As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.19):
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitam sattve prasidati
As a result of rajah and tamah, one becomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the
process of chanting and hearing, one comes to the platform of goodness and becomes happy. As he
advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate hrdaya-granthis
chidyante sarva-samsayah). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces.

While suffering at the time of death, Ajamila chanted the holy name of the Lord, and although the
chanting was directed toward his son, he nevertheless returned home, back to Godhead. Therefore if one
faithfully and inoffensively chants the holy name of the Lord, where is the doubt that he will return to
Godhead?
At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder. At that
time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able
to chant the Hare Krsna mantra very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of
chanting the holy name. While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the
Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be
properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the
holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.
Supplementary note to this chapter.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura's commentary to texts nine and ten of this chapter form a dialogue
concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the
Lord.
Someone may say, "It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed
from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only
once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning
for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of
the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?"
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura replies by quoting verses nine and ten of this chapter: "The
chanting of the holy name of Lord Visnu is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other
valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a brahmana, or for
one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of
atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all
other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu, such sinful persons may attract the
attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers "Because this man has chanted My holy name, My
duty is to give him protection.' "
One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this
is not called atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not
completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not
as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the sastras it is said that if a person only once
chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately
considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by Sridhara
Svami. Thus when Ajamila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamaraja, the
Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Ajamila was freed from all
sinful reactions, the Visnudutas spoke on his behalf.
Ajamila had named his son Narayana, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again
and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name Narayana
is not different from the Supreme Lord Narayana. When Ajamila named his son Narayana, all the
reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy
name of Narayana thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in Krsna consciousness.
One may argue, "Since he was constantly chanting the name of Narayana, how was it possible for him to
be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?" By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering
upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of Narayana was the
cause of his being freed. However, his chanting would then have been a nama-aparadha. Namno balad
yasya hi papa-buddhih: one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the
holy name of the Lord is a nama-aparadhi, an offender to the holy name. In response it may be said that
Ajamila's chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of Narayana with the purpose of
counteracting his sins. He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his
chanting of the name of Narayana was neutralizing them. Thus he did not commit a nama-aparadha, and
his repeated chanting of the holy name of Narayana while calling his son may be called pure chanting.
Because of this pure chanting, Ajamila unconsciously accumulated the results of bhakti. Indeed, even his
first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical
example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly,
Ajamila's devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the
reactions did not affect him. In the sastras it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even
once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one
extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent's future victims from poisonous effects, even
if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this
protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas."
Chapter Three
Yamaraja Instructs His Messengers
As related in this chapter, the Yamadutas approached Yamaraja, who very exhaustively explained
bhagavata-dharma, the religious principle of devotional service. Yamaraja thus satisfied the Yamadutas,
who had been very disappointed. Yamaraja said, "Although Ajamila was calling for his son, he chanted the
holy name of the Lord, Narayana, and simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name, he
immediately achieved the association of Lord Visnu's order carriers, who saved him from your attempt to
arrest him. This is quite all right. It is a fact that even a chronically sinful person who chants the holy
name of the Lord, although not completely without offenses, does not take another material birth."
By chanting the holy name of the Lord, Ajamila had met four order carriers of Lord Visnu. They were
very beautiful and had quickly come to rescue him. Yamaraja now described them. "The Visnudutas are
all pure devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Person in regard to the creation, maintenance and annihilation
of this cosmic manifestation. Neither King Indra, Varuna, Siva, Brahma, the seven rsis nor I myself can
understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, who is self-sufficient and beyond the reach
of the material senses. With material senses, no one can attain enlightenment about Him. The Lord, the
master of the illusory energy, possesses transcendental qualities for the good fortune of everyone, and His
devotees are also qualified in that way. The devotees, concerned only with rescuing the fallen souls from
this material world, apparently take birth in different places in the material world just to save the
conditioned souls. If one is somewhat interested in spiritual life, the devotees of the Lord protect him in
many ways."
Yamaraja continued, "The essence of sanatana-dharma, or eternal religion, is extremely confidential. No
one but the Lord Himself can deliver that confidential religious system to human society. It is by the
mercy of the Lord that the transcendental system of religion can be understood by His pure devotees, and
specifically by the twelve mahajanas--Lord Brahma, Narada Muni, Lord Siva, the Kumaras, Kapila, Manu,
Prahlada, Janaka, Bhisma, Bali, Sukadeva Gosvami and me. Other learned scholars, headed by Jaimini, are
almost always covered by the illusory energy, and therefore they are more or less attracted by the flowery
language of the three Vedas, namely Rg, Yajur and Sama, which are called trayi. Instead of becoming pure
devotees, people captivated by the flowery words of these three Vedas are interested in the Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies. They cannot understand the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord.
Intelligent persons, however, take to the devotional service of the Lord. When they chant the holy name
of the Lord without offenses, they are no longer subject to my rulings. If by chance they commit some
sinful act, they are protected by the holy name of the Lord because that is where their interest lies. The
four weapons of the Lord, especially the club and the Sudarsana cakra, always protect the devotees. One
who chants, hears or remembers the holy name of the Lord without duplicity, or who prays or offers
obeisances to the Lord, becomes perfect, whereas even a learned person may be called to hell if he is
bereft of devotional service."
After Yamaraja thus described the glories of the Lord and His devotees, Sukadeva Gosvami further
explained the potency of chanting the holy name and the futility of performing Vedic ritualistic
ceremonies and pious activities for atonement.

Yamaraja himself.

How many causes are responsible for manifesting the various results of activities performed under the

Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, were so
disappointed that they asked their master, almost in great anger, whether there were many masters other
than him. Furthermore, because the Yamadutas had been defeated and their master could not protect
them, they were inclined to say that there was no need to serve such a master. If a servant cannot carry
out the orders of his master without being defeated, what is the use of serving such a powerless master?

If in this universe there are many rulers and justices who disagree about punishment and reward, their
contradictory actions will neutralize each other, and no one will be punished or rewarded. Otherwise, if
their contradictory acts fail to neutralize each other, everyone will have to be both punished and
rewarded.
Because the Yamadutas had been unsuccessful in carrying out the order of Yamaraja, they doubted
whether Yamaraja actually had the power to punish the sinful. Although they had gone to arrest Ajamila,
following Yamaraja's order, they found themselves unsuccessful because of the order of some higher
authority. Therefore they were unsure of whether there were many authorities or only one. If there were
many authorities who gave different judgments, which could be contradictory, a person might be wrongly
punished or wrongly rewarded, or he might be neither punished nor rewarded. According to our
experience in the material world, a person punished in one court may appeal to another. Thus the same
man may be either punished or rewarded according to different judgments. However, in the law of nature
or the court of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there cannot be such contradictory judgments. The
judges and their judgments must be perfect and free from contradictions. Actually the position of
Yamaraja was very awkward in the case of Ajamila because the Yamadutas were right in attempting to
arrest Ajamila, but the Visnudutas had baffled them. Although Yamaraja, under these circumstances, was
accused by both the Visnudutas and the Yamadutas, he is perfect in administering justice because he is
empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he will explain what his real position is
and how everyone is controlled by the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.

The Yamadutas continued: Since there are many different karmis, or workers, there may be different
judges or rulers to give them justice, but just as one central emperor controls different departmental
rulers, there must be one supreme controller to guide all the judges.
In governmental management there may be departmental officials to give justice to different persons,
but the law must be one, and that central law must control everyone. The Yamadutas could not imagine
that two judges would give two different verdicts in the same case, and therefore they wanted to know
who the central judge is. The Yamadutas were certain that Ajamila was a most sinful man, but although
Yamaraja wanted to punish him, the Visnudutas excused him. This was a puzzling situation that the
Yamadutas wanted Yamaraja to clarify.

nasi--in the nose; ota-vat--like the rope; yasya--of whom; vase--under the control; ca--and; lokah--the
whole creation.
Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not. Above
me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and
controller. The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in charge of
the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe. He is like the two threads that form the
length and breadth of a woven cloth. The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a
rope in its nose.
The order carriers of Yamaraja suspected that there was a ruler even above Yamaraja. To eradicate their
doubts, Yamaraja immediately replied, "Yes, there is one supreme controller above everything." Yamaraja
is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also
move, are not under his control. Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among
them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamaraja. Therefore although
Yamaraja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities. There are other
demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, Krsna.
Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah: the supreme controller is Krsna. Others, who control
their own departments in the affairs of the universe, are insignificant in comparison to Krsna, the supreme
controller. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: "My dear
Dhananjaya [Arjuna], no one is superior to Me." Therefore Yamaraja immediately cleared away the doubts
of his assistants, the Yamadutas, by confirming that there is a supreme controller above all others.
Srila Madhvacarya explains that the words otam protam refer to the cause of all causes. The Supreme
Lord is both vertical and horizontal to the cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed by the following verse
from the Skanda Purana:
yatha kantha-patah sutra
otah protas ca sa sthitah
evam visnav idam visvam
otam protam ca samsthitam
Like the two threads, horizontal and vertical, of which a quilt is manufactured, Lord Visnu is situated as
the vertical and horizontal cause of the cosmic manifestation.

Just as the driver of a bullock cart ties ropes through the nostrils of his bulls to control them, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all men through the ropes of His words in the Vedas, which set
forth the names and activities of the distinct orders of human society [brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and
sudra]. In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations
according to their respective activities.
In this material world, everyone is conditioned, regardless of who he is. One may be a human being, a
demigod or an animal, tree or plant, but everything is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this
natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed by Bhagavad-gita (9.10),
wherein Krsna says, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: "The material nature is working under
My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings." Thus Krsna is behind the natural
machine, which works under His control.
Apart from other living entities, the living being in the human form of body is systematically controlled
by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the divisions of varna and asrama. A human being is expected to
follow the rules and regulations of varna and asrama; otherwise he cannot escape punishment by
Yamaraja. The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of a
brahmana, the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vaisnava.
This is the perfection of life. The brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra can elevate themselves by
worshiping the Lord according to their activities (sve sve karmany abhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah).
The divisions of varna and asrama are necessary to insure the proper execution of duties and peaceful
existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to worship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena
sarvam idam tatam). The Supreme Lord exists vertically and horizontally (otam protam), and therefore if
one follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one's ability, his life will
be perfect. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13):
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
"O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by
discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the
Lord Hari." The varnasrama institution offers the perfect process for making one eligible to return home,
back to Godhead, because the aim of every varna and asrama is to please the Supreme Lord. One can
please the Lord under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. and if one does so his life is perfect.
The Supreme Lord is worshipable. and everyone worships Him directly or indirectly. Those who worship
Him directly get the results of liberation quickly, whereas the liberation of those who serve Him indirectly
is delayed.
The words namabhir vaci are very important. In the varnasrama institution, there are different names--
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasi. The vak, or Vedic
injunctions, give directions for all these divisions. Everyone is expected to offer obeisances to the
Supreme Lord and perform duties as indicated in the Vedas.

universe, as well as the best of the demigods headed by Brhaspati, and the great sages headed by Bhrgu are
all certainly freed from the influence of the two base material modes of nature, namely passion and
ignorance. Nevertheless, although we are in the mode of goodness, we cannot understand the activities of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What, then, is to be said of others, who, under illusion, merely
speculate to know God?
The men and other living entities within this cosmic manifestation are controlled by the three modes of
nature. For the living entities controlled by the base qualities of nature, passion and ignorance, there is no
possibility of understanding God. Even those in the mode of goodness, like the many demigods and great
rsis described in these verses, cannot understand the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita, one who is situated in the devotional service of the Lord is transcendental to all
the material qualities. Therefore the Lord personally says that no one can understand Him but the
bhaktas, who are transcendental to all material qualities (bhaktya mam abhijanati). As stated by
Bhismadeva to Maharaja Yudhisthira in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.9.16):
na hy asya karhicid rajan

"O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord [Sri Krsna]. Even though great philosophers inquire
exhaustively, they are bewildered." No one, therefore, can understand God by speculative knowledge.
Indeed, by speculation one will be bewildered (muhyanti). This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
Among many thousands of men, one may endeavor for perfection, and even among the siddhas, those
who have already become perfect, only one who adopts the process of bhakti, devotional service, can
understand Krsna.

yam--whom; vai--indeed; na--not; gobhih--by the senses; manasa--by the mind; asubhih--by the life
breath; va--or; hrda--by thoughts; gira--by words; va--or; asu-bhrtah--the living entities; vicaksate--see or

the living entities; caksuh--the eyes; yatha--just like; eva--indeed; akrtayah--the different parts or limbs of
the body; tatah--than them; param--higher.
As the different limbs of the body cannot see the eyes, the living entities cannot see the Supreme Lord,
who is situated as the Supersoul in everyone's heart. Not by the senses, by the mind, by the life air, by
thoughts within the heart, or by the vibration of words can the living entities ascertain the real situation
of the Supreme Lord.
Although the different parts of the body do not have the power to see the eyes, the eyes direct the
movements of the body's different parts. The legs move forward because the eyes see what is in front of
them, and the hand touches because the eyes see touchable entities. Similarly, every living being acts
according to the direction of the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart. As the Lord Himself
confirms in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I
am sitting in everyone's heart and giving directions for remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."
Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita it is stated, isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati: "The Supreme
Lord, as the Supersoul, is situated within the heart." The living entity cannot do anything without the
sanction of the Supersoul. The Supersoul is acting at every moment, but the living entity cannot
understand the form and activities of the Supersoul by manipulating his senses. The example of the eyes
and the bodily limbs is very appropriate. If the limbs could see, they could walk forward without the help
of the eyes, but that is impossible. Although one cannot see the Supersoul in one's heart through sensual
activities, His direction is necessary.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient and fully independent. He is the master of
everyone and everything, including the illusory energy. He has His form, qualities and features; and
similarly His order carriers, the Vaisnavas, who are very beautiful, possess bodily features, transcendental
qualities and a transcendental nature almost like His. They always wander within this world with full
independence.
Yamaraja was describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, but the order
carriers of Yamaraja were very eager to know about the Visnudutas, who had defeated them in their
encounter with Ajamila. Yamaraja therefore stated that the Visnudutas resemble the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in their bodily features, transcendental qualities and nature. In other words, the Visnudutas,
or Vaisnavas, are almost as qualified as the Supreme Lord. Yamaraja informed the Yamadutas that the
Visnudutas are no less powerful than Lord Visnu. Since Visnu is above Yamaraja, the Visnudutas are
above the Yamadutas. Persons protected by the Visnudutas, therefore, cannot be touched by the
Yamadutas.

Lord from the hands of enemies, from envious persons and even from my jurisdiction, as well as from
natural disturbances.
Yamaraja has specifically described the qualities of the Visnudutas to convince his own servants not to
be envious of them. Yamaraja warned the Yamadutas that the Visnudutas are worshiped with respectful
obeisances by the demigods and are always very alert to protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands
of enemies, from natural disturbances and from all dangerous conditions in this material world.
Sometimes the members of the Krsna Consciousness Society are afraid of the impending danger of world
war and ask what would happen to them if a war should occur. In all kinds of danger, they should be
confident of their protection by the Visnudutas or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). Material danger is not meant for devotees.
This is also confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam. Padam padam yad vipadam na tesam: in this material world
there are dangers at every step, but they are not meant for devotees who have fully surrendered unto the
lotus feet of the Lord. The pure devotees of Lord Visnu may rest assured of the Lord's protection, and as
long as they are in this material world they should fully engage in devotional service by preaching the cult
of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Lord Krsna, namely the Hare Krsna movement of Krsna consciousness.

Real religious principles are enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although fully situated in
the mode of goodness, even the great rsis who occupy the topmost planets cannot ascertain the real
religious principles, nor can the demigods or the leaders of Siddhaloka, to say nothing of the asuras,
ordinary human beings, Vidyadharas and Caranas.
When challenged by the Visnudutas to describe the principles of religion, the Yamadutas said, vedapranihito
dharmah: the religious principles are the principles enacted in the Vedic literature. They did not
know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental, but
are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world. Real religious
principles are nistraigunya, above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental. The Yamadutas
did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting
Ajamila they were surprised. Materialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are
described in Bhagavad-gita (2.42), wherein Krsna says, veda-vada-ratah partha nanyad astiti vadinah: the
supposed followers of the Vedas say that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies. Indeed, there is a
group of men in India who are very fond of the Vedic rituals, not understanding the meaning of these
rituals, which are intended to elevate one gradually to the transcendental platform of knowing Krsna
(vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their
faith to the Vedic rituals are called veda-vada-ratah.
Herein it is stated that the real religious principle is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. That principle is stated in Bhagavad-gita. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja:
one should give up all other duties and surrender unto the lotus feet of Krsna. That is the real religious
principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows Vedic scriptures, one may not know this
transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the
demigods in the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental religious principle must
be understood from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly or from His special representative, as
stated in the next verses.

Lord Brahma, Bhagavan Narada, Lord Siva, the four Kumaras, Lord Kapila [the son of Devahuti],
Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlada Maharaja, Janaka Maharaja, Grandfather Bhisma, Bali Maharaja, Sukadeva
Gosvami and I myself know the real religious principle. My dear servants, this transcendental religious
principle, which is known as bhagavata-dharma, or surrender unto the Supreme Lord and love for Him, is
uncontaminated by the material modes of nature. It is very confidential and difficult for ordinary human
beings to understand, but if by chance one fortunately understands it, he is immediately liberated, and
thus he returns home, back to Godhead.
In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna refers to bhagavata-dharma as the most confidential religious principle
(sarva-guhyatamam, guhyad guhyataram). Krsna says to Arjuna, "Because you are My very dear friend, I
am explaining to you the most confidential religion." Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja:
"Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me." One may ask, "If this principle is very rarely
understood, what is the use of it?" In answer, Yamaraja states herein that this religious principle is
understandable if one follows the parampara system of Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the four Kumaras and the
other standard authorities. There are four lines of disciplic succession: one from Lord Brahma, one from
Lord Siva, one from Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, and one from the Kumaras. The disciplic succession
from Lord Brahma is called the Brahma-sampradaya, the succession from Lord Siva (Sambhu) is called the
Rudra-sampradaya, the one from the goddess of fortune, Laksmiji, is called the Sri-sampradaya, and the
one from the Kumaras is called the Kumara-sampradaya. One must take shelter of one of these four
sampradayas in order to understand the most confidential religious system. In the Padma Purana it is said,
sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah: if one does not follow the four recognized disciplic
successions, his mantra or initiation is useless. In the present day there are many apasampradayas, or
sampradayas which are not bona fide, which have no link to authorities like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the
Kumaras or Laksmi. People are misguided by such sampradayas. The sastras say that being initiated in
such a sampradaya is a useless waste of time, for it will never enable one to understand the real religious
principles.

etavan--this much; eva--indeed; loke asmin--in this material world; pumsam--of the living entities;
dharmah--the religious principles; parah--transcendental; smrtah--recognized; bhakti-yogah--bhakti-yoga,
or devotional service; bhagavati--to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (not to the demigods); tat--His;
nama--of the holy name; grahana-adibhih--beginning with chanting.
Devotional service, beginning with the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is the ultimate religious
principle for the living entity in human society.
As stated in the previous verse, dharmam bhagavatam, real religious principles, are bhagavata-dharma,
the principles described in Srimad-Bhagavatam itself or in Bhagavad-gita, the preliminary study of the
Bhagavatam. What are these principles? The Bhagavatam says, dharmah projjhita-kaitavo 'tra: in Srimad-
Bhagavatam there are no cheating religious systems. Everything in the Bhagavatam is directly connected
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Bhagavatam further says, sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato
bhaktir adhoksaje: the supreme religion is that which teaches its followers how to love the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of experimental knowledge. Such a religious system
begins with tan-nama-grahana, chanting of the holy name of the Lord (sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam). After chanting the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually
sees the form of the Lord, the pastimes of the Lord and the transcendental qualities of the Lord. This way
one fully understands the situation of the Personality of Godhead. One can come to this understanding of
the Lord, how He descends into the material world, how He takes His births and what activities He
performs, but one can know this only by executing devotional service. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya
mam abhijanati: simply by devotional service one can understand everything about the Supreme Lord. If
one fortunately understands the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is tyaktva deham punar janma naiti:
after giving up his material body, he no longer has to take birth in this material world. Instead, he returns
home, back to Godhead. That is the ultimate perfection. Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.15):
mam upetya punar janma
duhkhalayam asasvatam
napnuvanti mahatmanah
samsiddhim paramam gatah
"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world,
which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection."

My dear servants, who are as good as my sons, just see how glorious is the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord. The greatly sinful Ajamila chanted only to call his son, not knowing that he was chanting the
Lord's holy name. Nevertheless, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, he remembered Narayana, and
thus he was immediately saved from the ropes of death.
There is no need to conduct research into the significance of the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra.
The history of Ajamila is sufficient proof of the power of the Lord's holy name and the exalted position of
a person who chants the holy name incessantly. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
In this age of Kali, no one can perform all the ritualistic ceremonies for becoming liberated; that is
extremely difficult. Therefore all the sastras and all the acaryas have recommended that in this age one
chant the holy name.

etavatalam agha-nirharanaya pumsam

narayaneti mriyamana iyaya muktim
etavata--with this much; alam--sufficient; agha-nirharanaya--for taking away the reactions of sinful
activities; pumsam--of human beings; sankirtanam--the congregational chanting; bhagavatah--of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; guna--of the transcendental qualities; karma-namnam--and of His
names according to His activities and pastimes; vikrusya--crying to without offense; putram--his son;
aghavan--the sinful; yat--since; ajamilah api--even Ajamila; narayana--the Lord's name, Narayana; iti--
thus; mriyamanah--dying; iyaya--achieved; muktim--liberation.
Therefore it should be understood that one is easily relieved from all sinful reactions by chanting the
holy name of the Lord and chanting of His qualities and activities. This is the only process recommended
for relief from sinful reactions. Even if one chants the holy name of the Lord with improper
pronunciation, he will achieve relief from material bondage if he chants without offenses. Ajamila, for
example, was extremely sinful, but while dying he merely chanted the holy name, and although calling his
son, he achieved complete liberation because he remembered the name of Narayana.
In the assembly of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami's father, Haridasa Thakura confirmed that simply by
chanting the holy name of the Lord one is liberated, even if he does not chant completely inoffensively.
Smarta-brahmanas and Mayavadis do not believe that one can achieve liberation in this way, but the truth
of Haridasa Thakura's statement is supported by many quotations from Srimad-Bhagavatam.
In his commentary on this verse, for example, Sridhara Svami gives the following quotation:
sayam pratar grnan bhaktya
duhkha-gramad vimucyate
"If one always chants the holy name of the Lord with great devotion in the evening and in the morning,
one can become free from all material miseries." Another quotation confirms that one can achieve
liberation if one hears the holy name of the Lord constantly, every day with great respect (anudinam idam
adarena srnvan). Another quotation says:
sravanam kirtanam dhyanam
harer adbhuta-karmanah
janma-karma-gunanam ca
tad-arthe 'khila-cestitam
"One should always chant and hear about the extraordinarily wonderful activities of the Lord, one
should meditate upon these activities, and one should endeavor to please the Lord." (Bhag. 11.3.27)
Sridhara Svami also quotes from the Puranas, papa-ksayas ca bhavati smaratam tam ahar-nisam: "One
can become free from all sinful reactions simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord day and night
[ahar-nisam]." Furthermore, he quotes from Bhagavatam (6.3.31):
tasmat sankirtanam visnor
jagan-mangalam amhasam
mahatam api kauravya
viddhy aikantika-niskrtam
All these quotations prove that one who constantly engages in chanting and hearing of the holy
activities, name, fame and form of the Lord is liberated. As stated wonderfully in this verse, etavatalam
agha-nirharanaya pumsam: simply by uttering the name of the Lord, one is freed from all sinful reactions.
The word alam, which is used in this verse, indicates that simply uttering the holy name of the Lord is
sufficient. This word is used with different imports. As stated in the Amara-kosa, the most authorized
dictionary in the Sanskrit language, alam bhusana-paryapti-sakti-varana-vacakam: the word alam is used
to mean "ornament," "sufficiency," "power" and "restraint." Here the word alam is used to indicate that
there is no need of any other process, for the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is sufficient. Even if
one chants imperfectly, one becomes free from all sinful reactions by chanting.
This power of chanting the holy name was proved by the liberation of Ajamila. When Ajamila chanted
the holy name of Narayana, he did not precisely remember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his
own son. At the time of death, Ajamila certainly was not very clean; indeed, he was famous as a great
sinner. Furthermore, one's physiological condition is completely disturbed at the time of death, and in
such an awkward condition it would certainly have been very difficult for Ajamila to have chanted clearly.
Nevertheless, Ajamila achieved liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Therefore, what
is to be said of those who are not sinful like Ajamila? It is to be concluded that with a strong vow one
should chant the holy name of the Lord--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--for thus one will certainly be delivered from the clutches of maya by
the grace of Krsna.
The chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is recommended even for persons who commit offenses, because
if they continue chanting they will gradually chant offenselessly. By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra
without offenses, one increases his love for Krsna. As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, prema pumartho
mahan: one's main concern should be to increase one's attachment to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and to increase one's love for Him.
In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.19.24):
evam dharmair manusyanam
uddhavatmani vedinam
mayi sanjayate bhaktih
ko 'nyo 'rtho 'syavasisyate
"My dear Uddhava, the supreme religious system for human society is that by which one can awaken his
dormant love for Me." Commenting on this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the word
bhakti by saying premaivoktah. Kah anyah arthah asya: in the presence of bhakti, what is the necessity of
liberation?
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also quotes this verse from the Padma Purana:
namaparadha-yuktanam
namany eva haranty agham
avisranti-prayuktani
tany evartha-karani ca
Even if in the beginning one chants the Hare Krsna mantra with offenses, one will become free from
such offenses by chanting again and again. Papa-ksayas ca bhavati smaratam tam ahar-nisam: one
becomes free from all sinful reactions if one chants day and night, following the recommendation of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. It was Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu who quoted the following verse:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the
Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." If the members of the Krsna
consciousness movement strictly follow this recommendation of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, their position
will always be secure.

prayena--almost always; veda--know; tat--that; idam--this; na--not; mahajanah--great personalities

fruitive activities; yujyamanah--being engaged.
Because they are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yajnavalkya
and Jaimini and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the secret, confidential religious
system of the twelve mahajanas. They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing
devotional service or chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic
ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas--especially the Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Rg Veda--their intelligence
has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only
temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the
sankirtana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, kama and moksa.
Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask
why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. This verse
answers that question. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the real
purpose of studying the Vedas is to approach the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. Unfortunately, unintelligent
people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic yajnas want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want
Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to
observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. Recently, when we established a
large Krsna-Balarama temple in Vrndavana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by
brahmanas because the inhabitants of Vrndavana, especially the smarta-brahmanas, would not accept
Europeans and Americans as bona fide brahmanas. Thus we had to engage brahmanas to perform costly
yajnas. In spite of these yajnas, the members of our Society performed sankirtana loudly with mrdangas,
and I considered the sankirtana more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Both the
ceremonies and the sankirtana were going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons
interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (jadi-krta-matir madhu-puspitayam), whereas
the sankirtana was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
We would simply have performed sankirtana, but then the inhabitants of Vrndavana would not have
taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those
whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the Vedas, which describe fruitive activities
intended to elevate one to the higher planets.
Especially in this age of Kali, sankirtana alone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the
different parts of the world simply continue sankirtana before the Deity, especially before Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep
oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. Srila Jiva
Gosvami says that although sankirtana is sufficient for the perfection of life, the arcana, or worship of the
Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure. Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura therefore recommended that one follow both processes
simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and sankirtana along parallel
lines. This we should continue.

there is; patakam--some sinful activity; tat--that; api--also; hanti--destroys; urugaya-vadah--the chanting of
the holy name of the Supreme Lord.
Considering all these points, therefore, intelligent men decide to solve all problems by adopting the
devotional service of chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart and who is a
mine of all auspicious qualities. Such persons are not within my jurisdiction for punishment. Generally
they never commit sinful activities, but even if by mistake or because of bewilderment or illusion they
sometimes commit sinful acts, they are protected from sinful reactions because they always chant the Hare
Krsna mantra.
In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following verse from the prayers of Lord
Brahma (Bhag. 10.14.29):
athapi te deva padambuja-dvayaprasada-
lesanugrhita eva hi
janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno
na canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan
The purport is that even though one is a very learned scholar of the Vedic sastras, he may be completely
unaware of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His name, fame, qualities and so
forth, whereas one who is not a great scholar can understand the position of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead if he somehow or other becomes a pure devotee of the Lord by engaging in devotional service.
Therefore this verse spoken by Yamaraja says, evam vimrsya sudhiyo bhagavati: those who engage in the
loving service of the Lord become sudhiyah, intelligent, but this is not so of a Vedic scholar who does not
understand Krsna's name, fame and qualities. A pure devotee is one whose intelligence is clear; he is truly
thoughtful because he engages in the service of the Lord--not as a matter of show, but with love, with his
mind, words and body. Nondevotees may make a show of religion, but it is not very effective because
although they ostentatiously attend a temple or church, they are thinking of something else. Such persons
are neglecting their religious duty and are punishable by Yamaraja. But a devotee who commits sinful acts,
which he may do unwillingly or accidentally because of his former habits, is excused. That is the value of
the sankirtana movement.

My dear servants, please do not approach such devotees, for they have fully surrendered to the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are equal to everyone, and their narrations are sung by the
demigods and the inhabitants of Siddhaloka. Please do not even go near them. They are always protected
by the club of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore Lord Brahma and I and even the time
factor are not competent to chastise them.
In effect, Yamaraja warned his servants, "My dear servants, despite what you may have done previously
to disturb the devotees, henceforward you should stop. The actions of devotees who have surrendered
unto the lotus feet of the Lord and who constantly chant the holy name of the Lord are praised by the
demigods and the residents of Siddhaloka. Those devotees are so respectable and exalted that Lord Visnu
personally protects them with the club in His hand. Therefore, regardless of what you have done this
time, henceforward you should not approach such devotees; otherwise you will be killed by the club of
Lord Visnu. This is my warning. Lord Visnu has a club and cakra to punish nondevotees. Do not risk
punishment by attempting to disturb the devotees. Not to speak of you, if even Lord Brahma or I were to
punish them, Lord Visnu would punish us. Therefore do not disturb the devotees any further."

Paramahamsas are exalted persons who have no taste for material enjoyment and who drink the honey
of the Lord's lotus feet. My dear servants, bring to me for punishment only persons who are averse to the
taste of that honey, who do not associate with paramahamsas and who are attached to family life and
worldly enjoyment, which form the path to hell.
After warning the Yamadutas not to approach the devotees, Yamaraja now indicates who is to be
brought before him. He specifically advises the Yamadutas to bring him the materialistic persons who are
attached to household life merely for sex. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, yan maithunadi-grhamedhisukham
hi tuccham: people are attached to household life for sex only. They are always harassed in many
ways by their material engagements, and their only happiness is that after working very hard all day, at
night they sleep and indulge in sex. Nidraya hriyate naktam vyavayena ca va vayah: at night, materialistic
householders sleep or indulge in sex life. Diva carthehaya rajan kutumba-bharanena va: during the day
they are busy trying to find out where money is, and if they get money they spend it to maintain their
families. Yamaraja specifically advises his servants to bring these persons to him for punishment and not
to bring the devotees, who always lick the honey at the lotus feet of the Lord, who are equal to everyone,
and who try to preach Krsna consciousness because of sympathy for all living entities. Devotees are not
liable to punishment by Yamaraja, but persons who have no information of Krsna consciousness cannot
be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment. Srimad-Bhagavatam says (2.1.4):
dehapatya-kalatradisv
atma-sainyesv asatsv api
tesam pramatto nidhanam
pasyann api na pasyati
Such persons complacently believe that their nations, communities or families can protect them,
unaware that all such fallible soldiers will be destroyed in due course of time. In conclusion, one should
try to associate with persons who engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day.

My dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to chant
the holy name and qualities of Krsna, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of Krsna even once,
and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord Krsna. Send me those who do not perform
their duties toward Visnu, which are the only duties in human life. Please bring me all such fools and
rascals.
The word visnu-krtyan is very important in this verse because the purpose of human life is to please
Lord Visnu. Varnasrama-dharma is also meant for that purpose. As stated in the Visnu Purana (3.8.9):
varnasramacaravata
purusena parah puman
visnur aradhyate pantha
nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
Human society is meant to follow strictly the varnasrama-dharma, which divides society into four social
divisions (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and four spiritual divisions (brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa). Varnasrama-dharma easily brings one nearer to Lord Visnu, who is the only
true objective in human society. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: unfortunately, however, people do
not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Visnu. Durasaya
ye bahir-artha-maninah: instead, they are simply bewildered. Every human being is expected to perform
duties meant for approaching Lord Visnu. Therefore Yamaraja advises the Yamadutas to bring him those
persons who have forgotten their duties toward Visnu (akrta-visnu-krtyan). One who does not chant the
holy name of Visnu (Krsna), who does not bow down to the Deity of Visnu, and who does not remember
the lotus feet of Visnu is punishable by Yamaraja. In summary, all avaisnavas, persons unconcerned with
Lord Visnu, are punishable by Yamaraja.

[Then Yamaraja, considering himself and his servants to be offenders, spoke as follows, begging pardon
from the Lord.] O my Lord, my servants have surely committed a great offense by arresting a Vaisnava
such as Ajamila. O Narayana, O supreme and oldest person, please forgive us. Because of our ignorance,
we failed to recognize Ajamila as a servant of Your Lordship, and thus we have certainly committed a
great offense. Therefore with folded hands we beg Your pardon. My Lord, since You are supremely
merciful and are always full of good qualities, please pardon us. We offer our respectful obeisances unto
You.
Lord Yamaraja took upon himself the responsibility for the offense committed by his servants. If the
servant of an establishment makes a mistake, the establishment takes responsibility for it. Although
Yamaraja is above offenses, his servants, practically with his permission, went to arrest Ajamila, which
was a great offense. The nyaya-sastra confirms, bhrtyaparadhe svamino dandah: if a servant makes a
mistake, the master is punishable because he is responsible for the offense. Taking this seriously,
Yamaraja, along with his servants, prayed with folded hands to be excused by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Narayana.

auspicious activity in the entire universe. Please try to understand this so that others will take it seriously.
We should note that although Ajamila chanted the name of Narayana imperfectly, he was delivered
from all sinful reactions. The chanting of the holy name is so auspicious that it can free everyone from the
reactions of sinful activities. One should not conclude that one may continue to sin with the intention of
chanting Hare Krsna to neutralize the reactions. Rather, one should be very careful to be free from all sins
and never think of counteracting sinful activities by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, for this is another
offense. If by chance a devotee accidentally performs some sinful activity, the Lord will excuse him, but
one should not intentionally perform sinful acts.

One who constantly hears and chants the holy name of the Lord and hears and chants about His
activities can very easily attain the platform of pure devotional service, which can cleanse the dirt from
one's heart. One cannot achieve such purification merely by observing vows and performing Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies.
One may very easily practice chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and thus become ecstatic
in spiritual life. Padma Purana states:
namaparadha-yuktanam
namany eva haranty agham
avisranti-prayuktani
tany evartha-karani ca
Even if one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra offensively, one can avoid offenses by continuously
chanting without deviation. One who becomes accustomed to this practice will always remain in a pure
transcendental position, untouchable by sinful reactions. Sukadeva Gosvami especially requested King
Pariksit to note this fact very carefully. There is no profit, however, in executing the Vedic ritualistic
ceremonies. By performing such activities one may go to the higher planetary systems, but as stated in
Bhagavad-gita (9.21), ksine punye martya-lokam visanti: when the period of one's enjoyment in the
heavenly planets is terminated because of the limited extent of the results of one's pious activities, one
must return to earth. Thus there is no use in endeavoring to travel up and down in the universe. It is
better to chant the holy name of the Lord so that one may become fully purified and eligible to return
home, back to Godhead. That is the aim of life, and that is the perfection of life.

Devotees who always lick the honey from the lotus feet of Lord Krsna do not care at all for material
activities, which are performed under the three modes of material nature and which bring only misery.
Indeed, devotees never give up the lotus feet of Krsna to return to material activities. Others, however,
who are addicted to Vedic rituals because they have neglected the service of the Lord's lotus feet and are
enchanted by lusty desires, sometimes perform acts of atonement. Nevertheless, being incompletely
purified, they return to sinful activities again and again.
A devotee's duty is to chant the Hare Krsna mantra. One may sometimes chant with offenses and
sometimes without offenses, but if one seriously adopts this process, he will achieve perfection, which
cannot be achieved through Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement. Persons who are attached to the
Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, but do not believe in devotional service, who advise atonement, but do not
appreciate the chanting of the Lord's holy name, fail to achieve the highest perfection. Devotees, therefore,
being completely detached from material enjoyment, never give up Krsna consciousness for Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies. Those who are attached to Vedic ritualistic ceremonies because of lusty desires are
subjected to the tribulations of material existence again and again. Maharaja Pariksit has compared their
activities to kunjara-sauca, the bathing of an elephant.

Chapter Four
The Hamsa-guhya Prayers
After Maharaja Pariksit appealed to Sukadeva Gosvami to describe in further detail the creation of the
living entities within this universe, Sukadeva Gosvami informed him that when the Pracetas, the ten sons
of Pracinabarhi, entered the sea to execute austerities, the planet earth was neglected because of the
absence of a king. Naturally many weeds and unnecessary trees grew, and no food grains were produced.
Indeed, all the land became like a forest. When the ten Pracetas came out of the sea and saw the entire
world full of trees, they were very angry with the trees and decided to destroy them all to rectify the
situation. Thus the Pracetas created wind and fire to burn the trees to ashes. Soma, however, the king of
the moon and the king of all vegetation, forbade the Pracetas to destroy the trees, since the trees are the
source of fruit and flowers for all living beings. Just to satisfy the Pracetas, Soma gave them a beautiful girl
born of Pramloca Apsara. By the semen of all the Pracetas, Daksa was born of that girl.
In the beginning, Daksa created all the demigods, demons and human beings, but when he found the
population not increasing properly, he took sannyasa and went to Vindhya Mountain. where be
underwent severe austerities and offered Lord Visnu a particular prayer known as Hamsa-guhya, by which
Lord Visnu became very pleased with him. The contents of the prayer were as follows.
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, Lord Hari, is the controller of both the living
entities and the material nature. He is self-sufficient and self-effulgent. As the subject matter of perception
is not the cause of our perceiving senses, so the living entity, although within his body, does not cause his
eternal friend the Supersoul, who is the cause of creation of all the senses. Because of the living entity's
ignorance, his senses are engaged with material objects. Since the living entity is alive, he can understand
the creation of this material world to some extent, but he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is beyond the conception of the body, mind and intelligence. Nevertheless, great sages who
are always in meditation can see the personal form of the Lord within their hearts.
"Since an ordinary living being is materially contaminated, his words and intelligence are also material.
Therefore he cannot ascertain the Supreme Personality of Godhead by manipulating his material senses.
The conception of God derived through the material senses is inaccurate because the Supreme Lord is
beyond the material senses, but when one engages his senses in devotional service, the eternal Supreme
Personality of Godhead is revealed on the platform of the soul. When that Supreme Godhead becomes the
aim of one's life, one is said to have attained spiritual knowledge.
"The Supreme Brahman is the cause of all causes because He originally existed before the creation. He is
the original cause of everything, both material and spiritual, and His existence is independent. However,
the Lord has a potency called avidya, the illusory energy, which induces the false arguer to think himself
perfect and which induces the illusory energy to bewilder the conditioned soul. That Supreme Brahman,
the Supersoul, is very affectionate to His devotees. To bestow mercy upon them, He discloses His form,
name, attributes and qualities to be worshiped within this material world.
"Unfortunately, however, those who are materially absorbed worship various demigods. As the air
passes over a lotus flower and carries the scent of the flower with it, or as the air sometimes carries dust
and therefore assumes colors, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as the various demigods
according to the desires of His various foolish worshipers, but actually He is the supreme truth, Lord
Visnu. To fulfill the desires of His devotees, He appears in various incarnations, and therefore there is no
need to worship the demigods."
Being very satisfied by the prayers of Daksa, Lord Visnu appeared before Daksa with eight arms. The
Lord was dressed in yellow garments and had a blackish complexion. Understanding that Daksa was very
eager to follow the path of enjoyment, the Lord awarded him the potency to enjoy the illusory energy.
The Lord offered him the daughter of Pancajana named Asikni, who was suitable for Maharaja Daksa to
enjoy in sex. Indeed, Daksa received his name because he was very expert in sex life. After awarding this
benediction, Lord Visnu disappeared.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the ten sons of Pracinabarhi emerged from the waters, in which they
were performing austerities, they saw that the entire surface of the world was covered by trees.
When King Pracinabarhi was performing Vedic rituals in which the killing of animals was
recommended, Narada Muni, out of compassion, advised him to stop. Pracinabarhi understood Narada
properly and then left the kingdom to perform austerities in the forest. His ten sons, however, were
performing austerities within the water, and therefore there was no king to see to the management of the
world. When the ten sons, the Pracetas, came out of the water, they saw that the earth was overrun with
trees.
When the government neglects agriculture, which is necessary for the production of food, the land
becomes covered with unnecessary trees. Of course, many trees are useful because they produce fruits and
flowers, but many other trees are unnecessary. They could be used as fuel and the land cleared and used
for agriculture. When the government is negligent, less grain is produced. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhava jam: the proper engagements for vaisyas,
according to their nature, are to farm and to protect cows. The duty of the government and the ksatriyas is
to see that the members of the third class, the vaisyas, who are neither brahmanas nor ksatriyas, are thus
properly engaged. Ksatriyas are meant to protect human beings, whereas vaisyas are meant to protect
useful animals, especially cows.

drumebhyah--unto the trees; krudhyamanah--being very angry; te--they (the ten sons of Pracinabarhi);
tapah-dipita-manyavah--whose anger was inflamed because of long austerities; mukhatah--from the
mouth; vayum--wind; agnim--fire; ca--and; sasrjuh--they created; tat--those forests; didhaksaya--with the
desire to burn.
Because of having undergone long austerities in the water, the Pracetas were very angry at the trees.
Desiring to burn them to ashes, they generated wind and fire from their mouths.
Here the word tapo-dipita-manyavah indicates that persons who have undergone severe austerity
(tapasya) are endowed with great mystic power, as evinced by the Pracetas, who created fire and wind
from their mouths. Although devotees undergo severe tapasya, however, they are vimanyavah, sadhavah,
which means that they are never angry. They are always decorated with good qualities. Bhagavatam
(3.25.21) states:
titiksavah karunikah
suhrdah sarva-dehinam
ajata-satravah santah
sadhavah sadhu-bhusanah
A sadhu, a devotee, is never angry. Actually the real feature of devotees who undergo tapasya, austerity,
is forgiveness. Although a Vaisnava has sufficient power in tapasya, he does not become angry when put
into difficulty. If one undergoes tapasya but does not become a Vaisnava, however, one does not develop
good qualities. For example, Hiranyakasipu and Ravana also performed great austerities, but they did so
to demonstrate their demoniac tendencies. Vaisnavas must meet many opponents while preaching the
glories of the Lord, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommends that they not become angry while
preaching. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has given this formula: trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna.
amanina manadena kirtaniyah sada harih. "One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state
of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree,
devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respect to others. In such a state of
mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly." Those engaged in preaching the glories of the
Lord should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree; then they can preach the glories of the
Lord without difficulty.

My dear King Pariksit, when Soma, the king of the trees and predominating deity of the moon, saw the
fire and wind burning all the trees to ashes, he felt great sympathy because he is the maintainer of all
herbs and trees. To appease the anger of the Pracetas, Soma spoke as follows.
It is understood from this verse that the predominating deity of the moon is the maintainer of all the
trees and plants throughout the universe. It is due to the moonshine that trees and plants grow very
luxuriantly. Therefore how can we accept the so-called scientists whose moon expeditions have informed
us that there are no trees or vegetation on the moon? Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, somo
vrksadhisthata sa eva vrksanam raja: Soma, the predominating deity of the moon, is the king of all
vegetation. How can we believe that the maintainer of vegetation has no vegetation on his own planet?

by the Lord of lords to provide food for everyone. If the Pracetas tried to kill them off, their own subjects

animals like the deer.
By nature's arrangement, fruits and flowers are considered the food of insects and birds; grass and other
legless living entities are meant to be the food of four-legged animals like cows and buffalo; animals that
cannot use their front legs as hands are meant to be the food of animals like tigers, which have claws; and
four-legged animals like deer and goats, as well as food grains, are meant to be the food of human beings.
By nature's law, or the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one kind of living entity is
eatable by other living entities. As mentioned herein, dvi-padam ca catus-padah: the four-legged animals
(catus-padah), as well as food grains, are eatables for human beings (dvi-padam). These four-legged
animals are those such as deer and goats, not cows, which are meant to be protected. Generally the men of
the higher classes of society--the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas--do not eat meat. Sometimes ksatriyas
go to the forest to kill animals like deer because they have to learn the art of killing, and sometimes they
eat the animals also. Sudras, too, eat animals such as goats. Cows, however, are never meant to be killed
or eaten by human beings. In every sastra, cow killing is vehemently condemned. Indeed, one who kills a
cow must suffer for as many years as there are hairs on the body of a cow. Manu-samhita says, pravrttir
esa bhutanam nivrttis tu maha-phala: we have many tendencies in this material world, but in human life
one is meant to learn how to curb those tendencies. Those who desire to eat meat may satisfy the
demands of their tongues by eating lower animals, but they should never kill cows, who are actually
accepted as the mothers of human society because they supply milk. The sastra especially recommends,
krsi-go-raksya: the vaisya section of humanity should arrange for the food of the entire society through
agricultural activities and should give full protection to the cows, which are the most useful animals
because they supply milk to human society.

Unnecessary anger is contrary to your duty. Therefore I request you to control your anger.
Here the words pitra pitamahenapi justam vah prapitamahaih depict an honest royal family, consisting
of the kings, their father, their grandfather and their great-grandfathers. Such a royal family has a
prestigious position because it maintains the citizens, or prajas. The word praja refers to one who has
taken birth within the jurisdiction of the government. The exalted royal families were conscious that all
living beings, whether human, animal or lower than animal, should be given protection. The modern
democratic system cannot be exalted in this way because the leaders elected strive only for power and
have no sense of responsibility. In a monarchy, a king with a prestigious position follows the great deeds
of his forefathers. Thus Soma, the king of the moon, here reminds the Pracetas about the glories of their
father, grandfather and great-grandfathers.

As the father and mother are the friends and maintainers of their children, as the eyelid is the protector
of the eye, as the husband is the maintainer and protector of a woman, as the householder is the
maintainer and protector of beggars, and as the learned is the friend of the ignorant, so the king is the
protector and giver of life to all his subjects. The trees are also subjects of the king. Therefore they should
be given protection.
By the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead, there are various protectors and maintainers for
helpless living entities. The trees are also considered prajas, subjects of the king, and therefore the duty of
the monarch is to protect even the trees, not to speak of others. The king is duty-bound to protect the
living entities in his kingdom. Thus although the parents are directly responsible for the protection and
maintenance of their children, the duty of the king is to see that all parents do their duty properly.
Similarly, the king is also responsible for overseeing the other protectors mentioned in this verse. It may
also be noted that the beggars who should be maintained by the householders are not professional
beggars, but sannyasis and brahmanas, to whom the householders should supply food and clothing.

One who inquires into self-realization and thus subdues his powerful anger--which awakens suddenly
in the body as if falling from the sky--transcends the influence of the modes of material nature.
When one becomes angry, he forgets himself and his situation, but if one is able to consider his
situation by knowledge, one transcends the influence of the modes of material nature. One is always a
servant of lusty desires, anger, greed, illusion, envy and so forth, but if one obtains sufficient strength in
spiritual advancement, one can control them. One who obtains such control will always be
transcendentally situated, untouched by the modes of material nature. This is only possible when one
fully engages in the service of the Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyah
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the spiritual platform." By engaging one in
devotional service, the Krsna consciousness movement keeps one always transcendental to anger, greed,
lust, envy and so forth. One must perform devotional service because otherwise one will become
victimized by the modes of material nature.

body, and in the sixth manvantara, called the Caksusa manvantara, he was born of the womb of Marisa as
Daksa. In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes this verse:

"His previous body had been destroyed, but he, the same Daksa, inspired by the supreme will, created

Prajapati Daksa said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the illusory energy and
the physical categories it produces. He possesses the potency for unfailing knowledge and supreme
willpower, and He is the controller of the living entities and the illusory energy. The conditioned souls
who have accepted this material manifestation as everything cannot see Him, for He is above the evidence
of experimental knowledge. Self-evident and self-sufficient, He is not caused by any superior cause. Let
me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.
The transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained herewith. He is not
perceivable by the conditioned souls, who are accustomed to material vision and cannot understand that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead exists in His abode, which is beyond that vision. Even if a
materialistic person could count all the atoms in the universe, he would still be unable to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Brahma-samhita (5.34):
panthas tu koti-sata-vatsara-sampragamyo
vayor athapi manaso muni-pungavanam
so 'py asti yat-prapada-simny avicintya-tattve
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
The conditioned souls may try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead for many billions of
years through their mental speculative processes, traveling at the speed of the mind or the wind, but still
the Absolute Truth will remain inconceivable to them because a materialistic person cannot measure the
length and breadth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's unlimited existence. If the Absolute Truth is
beyond measurement, one may ask, how can one realize Him? The answer is given here by the word
svayambhuve: one may understand Him or not, but nevertheless He is existing in His own spiritual
potency.

As the sense objects [form, taste, touch, smell and sound] cannot understand how the senses perceive
them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand
how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses. Let me offer my
respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person, who is the supreme controller.
The individual soul and the Supreme Soul live together within the body. This is confirmed in the
Upanisads by the analogy that two friendly birds live in one tree--one bird eating the fruit of the tree and
the other simply witnessing and directing. Although the individual living being, who is compared to the
bird that is eating, is sitting with his friend the Supreme Soul, the individual living being cannot see Him.
Actually the Supersoul is directing the workings of his senses in the enjoyment of sense objects, but as
these sense objects cannot see the senses, the conditioned soul cannot see the directing soul. The
conditioned soul has desires, and the Supreme Soul fulfills them, but the conditioned soul is unable to see
the Supreme Soul. Thus Prajapati Daksa offers his obeisances to the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, even
though unable to see Him. Another example given is that although ordinary citizens work under the
direction of the government, they cannot understand how they are being governed or what the
government is. In this regard, Madhvacarya quotes the following verse from the Skanda Purana:
yatha rajnah priyatvam tu
bhrtya vedena catmanah
tatha jivo na yat-sakhyam
vetti tasmai namo 'stu te
"As the various servants in the different departments of big establishments cannot see the supreme
managing director under whom they are working, the conditioned souls cannot see the supreme friend
sitting within their bodies. Let us therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who is
invisible to our material eyes."

dehah--this body; asavah--the life airs; aksah--the different senses; manavah--the mind, understanding,

Because they are only matter, the body, the life airs, the external and internal senses, the five gross
elements and the subtle sense objects [form, taste, smell, sound and touch] cannot know their own
nature, the nature of the other senses or the nature of their controllers. But the living being, because of his
spiritual nature, can know his body, the life airs, the senses, the elements and the sense objects, and he
can also know the three qualities that form their roots. Nevertheless, although the living being is
completely aware of them, he is unable to see the Supreme Being, who is omniscient and unlimited. I
therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.
Material scientists can make an analytical study of the physical elements, the body, the senses, the sense
objects and even the air that controls the vital force, but still they cannot understand that above all these
is the real spirit soul. In other words, the living entity, because of his being a spirit soul, can understand
all the material objects, or, when self-realized, he can understand the Paramatma, upon whom yogis
meditate. Nevertheless, the living being, even if advanced, cannot understand the Supreme Being, the
Personality of Godhead, for He is ananta, unlimited, in all six opulences.

When one's consciousness is completely purified of the contamination of material existence, gross and
subtle, without being agitated as in the working and dreaming states, and when the mind is not dissolved
as in susupti, deep sleep, one comes to the platform of trance. Then one's material vision and the
memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.
There are two stages of God realization. One is called sujneyam, or very easily understood (generally by
mental speculation), and the other is called durjneyam, understood only with difficulty. Paramatma
realization and Brahman realization are considered sujneyam, but realization of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is durjneyam. As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of
Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind--thinking, feeling and willing--or, in other words,
when mental speculation stops. This transcendental realization is above susupti, deep sleep. In our gross
conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle
stage we perceive the world in dreams. The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in
a subtle form. Above gross experience and dreams is susupti, deep sleep, and when one comes to the
completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, visuddha-sattva, or vasudevasattva,
in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.
Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: as long as one is situated in duality, on the sensual
platform, gross or subtle, realization of the original Personality of Godhead is impossible. Sevonmukhe hi
jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: but when one engages his senses in the service of the Lord--
specifically, when one engages the tongue in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and tasting only Krsna
prasada with a spirit of service--the Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed. This is indicated in this
verse by the word suci-sadmane. Suci means purified. By the spirit of rendering service with one's senses,
one's entire existence becomes suci-sadma, the platform of uncontaminated purity. Daksa therefore offers
his respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is revealed on the platform of
suci-sadma. In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following prayer by Lord
Brahma from the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.6): tathapi bhuman mahimagunasya te viboddhum arhaty
amalantar-atmabhih. "One whose heart has become completely purified, my Lord, can understand the
transcendental qualities of Your Lordship and can understand the greatness of Your activities."

Just as great learned brahmanas who are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices can
extract the fire dormant within wooden fuel by chanting the fifteen Samidheni mantras, thus proving the
efficacy of the Vedic mantras, so those who are actually advanced in consciousness--in other words, those
who are Krsna conscious--can find the Supersoul, who by His own spiritual potency is situated within the
heart. The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material
nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by
the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy
of the Lord. Great yogis meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Paramatma, within the
core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for
liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he
engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of
service. The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material
senses. When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?
In his commentary to this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura uses the word durvijneyam, which
means "very difficult to realize." The pure stage of existence is described in Bhagavad-gita (7.28), wherein
Krsna says:
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination."
Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (9.14) the Lord says:
satatam kirtayanto mam
yatantas ca drdha-vratah
namasyantas ca mam bhaktya
nitya-yukta upasate
"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these
great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."
One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead after transcending all material impediments.
Therefore Lord Krsna also says in the Gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."
To understand Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must undergo severe penances and
austerities, but since the path of devotional service is perfect, by following this process one can very easily
come to the spiritual platform and understand the Lord. This, too, is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.55),
wherein Krsna says:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And
when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom
of God."
Thus although the subject matter is durvijneyam, extremely difficult to understand, it becomes easy if
one follows the prescribed method. Coming in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible
through pure devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh. In this regard, Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.8.5): pravistah karnarandhrena
svanam bhava-saroruham. The process of hearing and chanting enters the core of the heart,
and in this way one becomes a pure devotee. By continuing this process, one comes to the stage of
transcendental love, and then he appreciates the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, a pure devotee, by devotional service, is able to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead despite many material impediments, which are all various energies of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Easily making his way through these impediments, a devotee comes
directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, the material impediments
described in these verses are but various energies of the Lord. When a devotee is eager to see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he prays to the Lord:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"O son of Maharaja Nanda [Krsna], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into
the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms
at Your lotus feet." Being pleased with the devotee, the Lord turns all his material impediments into
spiritual service. In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from the Visnu
Purana:
hladini sandhini samvit
tvayy eka sarva-samsthitau
hlada-tapa-kari misra
tvayi no guna-varjite
In the material world, the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as tapakari,
which means "causing miseries." Everyone hankers for happiness, but although happiness originally
comes from the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the material world, because
of material activities, the pleasure potency of the Lord becomes a source of miseries (hlada-tapa-kari).
False happiness in the material world is the source of distress, but when one's endeavors for happiness are
redirected toward the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this tapa-kari element of misery
is vanquished. An example given in this connection is that extracting fire from wood is certainly difficult,
but when the fire comes out it burns the wood to ashes. In other words, experiencing the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult for those devoid of devotional service, but everything
becomes easier for a devotee, and thus he can very easily meet the Supreme Lord.
Here the prayers say that the form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of material form and is
therefore inconceivable. A devotee prays, however, "My dear Lord, be pleased with me so that I may very
easily see Your transcendental form and potency." Nondevotees try to understand the Supreme Brahman
by discussions of neti neti. Nisedha-nirvana-sukhanubhutih: a devotee, however, simply by chanting the
holy name of the Lord, avoids such laborious speculations and realizes the existence of the Lord very
easily.

cause of the annihilation of everything made of the material modes of nature; visarga--and the creation;
laksanah--appearing as.
Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything
experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of
material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the
material qualities and creation. As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the
creation. I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.
One who manufactures names, forms, qualities or paraphernalia pertaining to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead cannot understand Him, since He is beyond creation. The Supreme Lord is the creator of
everything, and this means that He existed when there was no creation. In other words, His name, form
and qualities are not materially created entities; they are transcendental always. Therefore by our material
concoctions, vibrations and thoughts we cannot ascertain the Supreme Lord. This is explained in the
verse atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih.
Pracetasa, Daksa, herein offers prayers unto the Transcendence, not to anyone within the material
creation. Only fools and rascals think God a material creation. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (9.11):
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be." Therefore, one must receive knowledge from a person to whom
the Lord has revealed Himself; there is no value in creating an imaginary name or form for the Lord.
Sripada Sankaracarya was an impersonalist, but nevertheless he said, narayanah paro 'vyaktat: Narayana,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not a person of the material world. We cannot assign Narayana a
material designation, as the foolish attempt to do when they speak of daridra-narayana (poor Narayana).
Narayana is always transcendental, beyond this material creation. How can He become daridra-narayana?
Poverty is found within this material world, but in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as poverty.
Therefore the idea of daridra-narayana is merely a concoction.
Daksa very carefully points out that material designations cannot be names of the worshipable Lord: yad
yan niruktam vacasa nirupitam. Nirukta refers to the Vedic dictionary. One cannot properly understand
the Supreme Personality of Godhead merely by picking up expressions from a dictionary. In praying to
the Lord, Daksa does not wish material names and forms to be the objects of his worship; rather, he wants
to worship the Lord, who existed before the creation of material dictionaries and names. As confirmed in
the Vedas, yato vaco nivartante. aprapya manasa saha: the name, form, attributes and paraphernalia of the
Lord cannot be ascertained through a material dictionary. However, if one reaches the transcendental
platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes well acquainted with
everything, material and spiritual. This is confirmed in another Vedic mantra: tam eva viditvati mrtyum
eti. If one can somehow or other, by the grace of the Lord, understand the transcendental position of the
Lord, one becomes eternal. This is further confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Simply by
understanding the Supreme Lord, one goes beyond birth, death, old age and disease. Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami therefore advised Maharaja Pariksit in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.5):
tasmad bharata sarvatma
bhagavan isvaro harih
srotavyah kirtitavyas ca
smartavyas cecchatabhayam
"O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear, glorify and also
remember the Personality of Godhead. who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all
miseries."

a second.
The Supreme Brahman, Krsna, is the ultimate resting place and source of everything. Everything is done
by Him, everything belongs to Him, and everything is offered to Him. He is the ultimate objective, and
whether acting or causing others to act, He is the ultimate doer. There are many causes, high and low, but
since He is the cause of all causes, He is well known as the Supreme Brahman who existed before all
activities. He is one without a second and has no other cause. I therefore offer my respects unto Him.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original cause, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (aham
sarvasya prabhavah). Even this material world, which is conducted under the modes of material nature, is
caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who therefore also has an intimate relationship with the
material world. If the material world were not a part of His body, the Supreme Lord, the supreme cause,
would be incomplete. Therefore we hear, vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah: if one knows
that Vasudeva is the original cause of all causes, he becomes a perfect mahatma.
The Brahma-samhita (5.1) declares:
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." The Supreme
Brahman (tad brahma) is the cause of all causes, but He has no cause. Anadir adir govindah sarva-karanakaranam:
Govinda, Krsna, is the original cause of all causes, but He has no cause for His appearance as
Govinda. Govinda expands in multifarious forms, but nevertheless they are one. As confirmed by
Madhvacarya, ananyah sadrsabhavad eko rupady-abhedatah: Krsna has no cause nor any equal, and He is
one because His various forms, as svamsa and vibhinnamsa, are nondifferent from Himself.

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
possesses unlimited transcendental qualities. Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all
philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes
agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves. Thus He creates within this material world a
situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion. I offer my obeisances unto Him.
Since time immemorial or since the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the conditioned souls have
formed various parties of philosophical speculation, but this is not true of the devotees. Nondevotees have
different ideas of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and therefore they are called vadis and
prativadis--proponents and counterproponents. It is understood from the statement of Mahabharata that
there are many munis, or speculators:
tarko 'pratisthah srutayo vibhinna
nasav rsir yasya matam na bhinnam
All speculators must disagree with other speculators; otherwise, why should there be so many opposing
parties concerned with ascertaining the supreme cause?
Philosophy means finding the ultimate cause. As Vedanta-sutra very reasonably says, athato brahma
jijnasa: human life is meant for understanding the ultimate cause. Devotees accept that the ultimate cause
is Krsna because this conclusion is supported by all Vedic literature and also by Krsna Himself, who says,
aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am the source of everything." Devotees have no problem understanding the
ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who
wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way. In India there are many parties of
philosophers, such as the dvaita-vadis, advaita-vadis, vaisesikas, mimamsakas, Mayavadis and svabhavavadis,
and each of them opposes the others. Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many
philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation. Thus it is undoubtedly a
fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others.
Now, one might ask why there are so many philosophers if the ultimate goal of philosophy is one.
Undoubtedly the ultimate cause is one--the Supreme Brahman. As Arjuna told Krsna in Bhagavad-gita
(10.12):
param brahma param dhama
pavitram paramam bhavan
purusam sasvatam divyam
adi-devam ajam vibhum
"You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and
the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn
and all-pervading beauty." Nondevotee speculators, however, do not accept an ultimate cause (sarvakarana-
karanam). Because they are ignorant and bewildered concerning the soul and its activities, even
though some of them have a vague idea of the soul, many controversies arise, and the philosophical
speculators can never reach a conclusion. All of these speculators are envious of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and as Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (16.19-20):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
asurim yonim apanna
mudha janmani janmani
mam aprapyaiva kaunteya
tato yanty adhamam gatim
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth among the species of
demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable
type of existence." Because of their envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nondevotees are born in
demoniac families life after life. They are great offenders, and because of their offenses the Supreme Lord
keeps them always bewildered. Kurvanti caisam muhur atma-moham: the Lord, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, purposely keeps them in darkness (atma-moham).
The great authority Parasara, the father of Vyasadeva, explains the Supreme Personality of Godhead
thus:
jnana-sakti-balaisvaryavirya-
tejamsy asesatah
bhagavac-chabda-vacyani
vina heyair gunadibhih
The demoniac speculators cannot understand the transcendental qualities, form, pastimes, strength,
knowledge and opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are all free from material
contamination (vina heyair gunadibhih). These speculators are envious of the existence of the Lord. Jagad
ahur anisvaram: their conclusion is that the entire cosmic manifestation has no controller, but is just
working naturally. Thus they are kept in constant darkness, birth after birth, and cannot understand the
real cause of all causes. This is the reason why there are so many schools of philosophical speculation.

There are two parties--namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds
the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The Sankhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material
elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause--whether
Bhagavan, Paramatma or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external
activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because
although they offer opposing statements, their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both
approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.
Actually there are two sides to this argument. Some say that the Absolute has no form (nirakara), and
others say that the Absolute has a form (sakara). Therefore the word form is the common factor, although
some accept it (asti or astika) whereas others try to negate it (nasti or nastika). Since the devotee
considers the word "form" (akara) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the
form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not.
In this verse the word yoga-sankhyayoh is very important. Yoga means bhakti-yoga because yogis also
accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their
hearts. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.1), dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam
yoginah. The devotee tries to come directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas
the yogi tries to find the Supersoul within the heart by meditation. Thus, both directly and indirectly,
yoga means bhakti-yoga. Sankhya, however, means physical study of the cosmic situation through
speculative knowledge. This is generally known as jnana-sastra. The Sankhyites are attached to the
impersonal Brahman, but the Absolute Truth is known in three ways. Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti
sabdyate: the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul
existing everywhere, and some as Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the
Absolute Truth.
Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same
Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth. In the yoga-sastras, Krsna is described as follows: krsnam
pisangambaram ambujeksanam catur-bhujam sankha-gadady-udayudham. Thus the pleasing appearance
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described. The
sankhya-sastra, however, denies the existence of the Lord's transcendental form. The sankhya-sastra says
that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: hy anama-rupa-guna-pani-padam
acaksur asrotram ekam advitiyam api nama-rupadikam nasti. The Vedic mantras say, apani-pado javano
grahita: the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him. Actually
such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and
legs. This is why the Absolute is called aprakrta. Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a saccid-
ananda-vigraha, a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form. The Sankhyites, or
jnanis, deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan,
has no material form.
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." The conception of
the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are
apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person.
Therefore the word vastu-nisthayoh, which is used herein, indicates that both the yogis and Sankhyites
have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual
identities. Parabrahman, or brhat, is the common point. The Sankhyites and yogis are both situated in that
same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision.
The directions given by the bhakti-sastra point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme
Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati: "Only by devotional service am I
to be known." The bhaktas know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the jnanis
simply deny the material form. One should therefore take shelter of the bhakti-marga, the path of
devotion; then everything will be clear. Jnanis concentrate on the virat-rupa, the gigantic universal form
of the Lord. This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is
no need to think continuously of the virat-rupa. When Arjuna was shown the virat-rupa of Krsna, he saw
it, but he did not want to see it perpetually. He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form
as two-armed Krsna. In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees' concentration
upon the spiritual form of the Lord (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah). In this regard,
Srila Madhvacarya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but
because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
the ultimate goal.

yo 'nugrahartham bhajatam pada-mulam
anama-rupo bhagavan anantah
namani rupani ca janma-karmabhir
bheje sa mahyam paramah prasidatu
yah--who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); anugraha-artham--to show His causeless mercy;
bhajatam--to the devotees who always render devotional service; pada-mulam--to His transcendental lotus
feet; anama--with no material name; rupah--or material form; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; anantah--unlimited, all-pervading and eternally existing; namani--transcendental holy names;
rupani--His transcendental forms; ca--also; janma-karmabhih--with His transcendental birth and
activities; bheje--manifests; sah--He; mahyam--unto me; paramah--the Supreme; prasidatu--may He be
merciful.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inconceivably opulent, who is devoid of all material
names, forms and pastimes, and who is all-pervading, is especially merciful to the devotees who worship
His lotus feet. Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes. May that
Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to
me.
In regard to the significant word anama-rupah, Sri Sridhara Svami says, prakrta-nama-rupa-rahito 'pi.
The word anama, which means "having no name," indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has
no material name. Simply by chanting the name of Narayana to call his son, Ajamila attained salvation.
This means that Narayana is not an ordinary mundane name; it is nonmaterial. The word anama,
therefore, indicates that the names of the Supreme Lord do not belong to this material world. The
vibration of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is not a material sound, and similarly the form of the Lord and
His appearance and activities are all nonmaterial. To show His causeless mercy to the devotees, as well as
to the nondevotees, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world with
names, forms and pastimes, all of which are transcendental. Unintelligent men who cannot understand
this think that these names, forms and pastimes are material, and therefore they deny that He has a name
or a form.
Considered with scrutiny, the conclusion of nondevotees, who say that God has no name, and that of
devotees, who know that His name is not material, are practically the same. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no material name, form, birth, appearance or disappearance, but nevertheless, He takes His
birth (janma). As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.6):
ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya
Although the Lord is unborn (aja) and His body never undergoes material changes, He nevertheless
appears as an incarnation, maintaining Himself always in the transcendental stage (suddha-sattva). Thus
He exhibits His transcendental forms, names and activities. That is His special mercy toward His devotees.
Others may continue merely arguing about whether the Absolute Truth has form or not, but when a
devotee, by the grace of the Lord, sees the Lord personally, he becomes spiritually ecstatic.
Unintelligent persons say that the Lord does nothing. Actually He has nothing to do, but nevertheless
He has to do everything, because without His sanction no one can do anything. The unintelligent,
however, cannot see how He is working and how the entire material nature is working under His
direction. His different potencies work perfectly.
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8)
He has nothing to do personally, for since His potencies are perfect, everything is immediately done by
His will. Persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not revealed cannot see how He is
working, and therefore they think that even if there is God, He has nothing to do or has no particular
name.
Actually the Lord's name already exists because of His transcendental activities. The Lord is sometimes
called guna-karma-nama because He is named according to His transcendental activities. For example,
Krsna means "all-attractive." This is the Lord's name because His transcendental qualities make Him very
attractive. As a small boy He lifted Govardhana Hill, and in His childhood He killed many demons. Such
activities are very attractive, and therefore He is sometimes called Giridhari, Madhusudana, Aghanisudana
and so on. Because He acted as the son of Nanda Maharaja, He is called Nanda-tanuja. These
names already exist, but since nondevotees cannot understand the names of the Lord, He is sometimes
called anama, or nameless. This means that He has no material names. All His activities are spiritual, and
therefore He has spiritual names.
Generally, less intelligent men are under the impression that the Lord has no form. Therefore He
appears in His original form as Krsna, sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, to carry out His mission of participating in
the Battle of Kuruksetra and pastimes to protect the devotees and vanquish the demons (paritranaya
sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam). This is His mercy. For those who think that He has no form and no
work to do, Krsna comes to show that indeed He works. He works so gloriously that no one else can
perform such uncommon acts. Although He appeared as a human being, He married 16,108 wives, which
is impossible for a human being to do. The Lord performs such activities to show people how great He is,
how affectionate He is and how merciful He is. Although His original name is Krsna (krsnas tu bhagavan
svayam), He acts in unlimited ways, and therefore according to His work He has many, many thousands
of names.

yah prakrtair jnana-pathair jananam

yah--who; prakrtaih--lower grade; jnana-pathaih--by the paths of worship; jananam--of all living
entities; yatha-asayam--according to the desire; deha-gatah--situated within the core of the heart; vibhati--
manifests; yatha--just as; anilah--the air; parthivam--earthly; asritah--receiving; gunam--the quality (like
flavor and color); sah--He; isvarah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; me--my; kurutam--may He
fulfill; manoratham--desire (for devotional service).
As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors
resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according
to one's desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form. What is the use of
these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.
The impersonalists imagine the various demigods to be forms of the Lord. For example, the Mayavadis
worship five demigods (pancopasana). They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the
sake of worship they imagine some form to be God. Generally they imagine a form of Visnu, a form of
Siva, and forms of Ganesa, the sun-god and Durga. This is called pancopasana. Daksa, however, wanted to
worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord Krsna.
In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the difference between the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being. As pointed out in a previous verse, sarvam puman
veda gunams ca taj-jno na veda sarva jnam anantam ide: the omnipotent Supreme Lord knows everything,
but the living being does not actually know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita, "I know everything, but no one knows Me." This is the difference between the Supreme
Lord and an ordinary living being. In a prayer in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Queen Kunti says, "My dear Lord,
You exist inside and outside, yet no one can see You."
The conditioned soul cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by speculative knowledge
or by imagination. One must therefore know the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He reveals Himself, but He cannot be understood by speculation. As
stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.29):
athapi te deva padambuja-dvayaprasada-
lesanugrhita eva hi
janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno
na canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan
"My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the
greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead
are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years."
This is the verdict of the sastra. An ordinary man may be a great philosopher and may speculate upon
what the Absolute Truth is, what His form is and where He is existing, but be cannot understand these
truths. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: one can understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead only through devotional service. This is also explained by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Himself in Bhagavad-gita (18.55). Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: "One can
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service." Unintelligent
persons want to imagine or concoct a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but devotees want to
worship the actual Personality of Godhead. Therefore Daksa prays, "One may think of You as personal,
impersonal or imaginary, but I wish to pray to Your Lordship that You fulfill my desires to see You as You
actually are."
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that this verse is especially meant for the impersonalist,
who thinks that he himself is the Supreme because there is no difference between the living being and
God. The Mayavadi philosopher thinks that there is only one Supreme Truth and that he is also that
Supreme Truth. Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such
fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (mayayapahrta jnanah). Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that such persons, jnani-maninah, think themselves very advanced, but actually they are
unintelligent.
In regard to this verse, Srila Madhvacarya says:
svadeha-stham harim prahur
adhama jivam eva tu
madhyamas capy anirnitam
jivad bhinnam janardanam
There are three classes of men--the lowest (adhama), those in the middle (madhyama), and the best
(uttama). The lowest (adhama) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except
that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations. In their
opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the jiva, the living entity, will mix
with the Supreme. They give the argument of ghatakasa-patakasa, in which the body is compared to a pot
with the sky within and the sky without. When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky
outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme. This is their
argument, but Srila Madhvacarya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men.
Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is
a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being. Such philosophers are accepted as
mediocre. The best, however. are those who understand the Supreme Lord (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha).
Purnanandadi-gunakam sarva jiva-vilaksanam: His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and
completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity. Uttamas tu harim prahus
taratamyena tesu ca: such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature. They know that
there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme
power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees
he may be able to understand that Krsna is the Supreme personality of Godhead. As Lord Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: "There is no truth superior to Me." Aham
adir hi devanam: "I am the origin of all the demigods." Aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am superior to
everyone, even Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods." These are the conclusions of the sastra,
and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher. Such a philosopher
knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (deva-devesvaram sutram
anandam prana-vedinah).

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is extremely affectionate to
His devotees, was very pleased by the prayers offered by Daksa, and thus He appeared at that holy place
known as Aghamarsana. O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Kuru dynasty, the Lord's lotus feet rested on the
shoulders of His carrier, Garuda, and He appeared with eight long, mighty, very beautiful arms. In His
hands He held a disc, conchshell, sword, shield, arrow, bow, rope and club--in each hand a different
weapon, all brilliantly shining. His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish. His eyes and
face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers. His chest was
decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of Srivatsa. On His head was a gorgeous round helmet,
and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks. All these ornaments were uncommonly
beautiful. The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle
bells on His feet. Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living
entities of the three worlds, is known as Purusottama, the best personality. He was accompanied by great
devotees like Narada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the
residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and Caranaloka. Situated
on both sides of the Lord and behind Him as well, these devotees offered Him prayers continuously.

exalted devotion, your life is now successful. You have achieved complete perfection.
As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (8.15), one reaches the highest perfection when he
attains the fortune of realizing the Supreme Personality of Godhead:
mam upetya punar janma

"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world,

My dear Prajapati Daksa, you have performed extreme austerities for the welfare and growth of the
world. My desire also is that everyone within this world be happy. I am therefore very pleased with you
because you are endeavoring to fulfill My desire for the welfare of the entire world.
After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of
Karanodakasayi Visnu, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their
various species to resume their activities. Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living
entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material
nature? Here the Lord says to Daksa, "You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire."
The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living
entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain
within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again. There is a
chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of
this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death
again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (15.7)
the Lord says:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entity's struggle for
existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature. Unless a living entity surrenders to
Krsna, he must continue this life of struggle.
The Krsna consciousness movement is not a fad. It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the
welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of Krsna consciousness. If
one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the
upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 20.118),
kabhu svarge uthaya, kabhu narake dubaya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and
sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul.
Prajapati Daksa is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a
chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to Krsna. If one begets children with the purpose of
training them to surrender to Krsna, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains
the conditioned souls to become Krsna conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned
souls a chance to become Krsna conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (prito 'ham). Following the examples of the previous
acaryas, all the members of the Krsna consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned
souls by inducing them to become Krsna conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities
constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread Krsna
consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in
Bhagavad-gita (18.68-69):
ya idam paramam guhyam
mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati
bhaktim mayi param krtva
mam evaisyaty asamsayah
na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah
bhavita na ca me tasmad
anyah priyataro bhuvi
"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the
end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there
ever be one more dear."

brahma--Lord Brahma; bhavah--Lord Siva; bhavantah--all of you prajapatis; ca--and; manavah--the
Manus; vibudha-isvarah--all the different demigods (such as the sun, the moon, Venus, Mars and Jupiter,
who are all in charge of various activities for the welfare of the world); vibhutayah--expansions of energy;
mama--My; hi--indeed; etah--all these; bhutanam--of all the living entities; bhuti--of welfare; hetavah--
causes.
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the Manus, all the other demigods in the higher planetary systems, and you
prajapatis, who are increasing the population, are working for the benefit of all living entities. Thus you
expansions of My marginal energy are incarnations of My various qualities.
There are various types of incarnations or expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
expansions of His personal self, or visnu-tattva, are called svamsa expansions, whereas the living entities,
who are not visnu-tattva but jiva-tattva, are called vibhinnamsa, separated expansions. Although Prajapati
Daksa is not on the same level as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, he is compared to them because he engages
in the service of the Lord. In the service of the Personality of Godhead, it is not that Lord Brahma is
considered very great while an ordinary human being trying to preach the glories of the Lord is
considered very low. There are no such distinctions. Regardless of whether materially high or materially
low, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is spiritually very dear to Him. In this regard, Srila
Madhvacarya gives this quotation from the Tantra-nirnaya:
visesa-vyakti-patratvad
brahmadyas tu vibhutayah
tad-antaryaminas caiva
matsyadya vibhavah smrtah
From Lord Brahma down, all the living entities engaged in the service of the Lord are extraordinary and
are called vibhuti. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.41):
yad yad vibhutimat sattvam
srimad urjitam eva va
tat tad evavagaccha tvam
mama tejo-'msa-sambhavam
"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor." A
living entity especially empowered to act on behalf of the Lord is called vibhuti, whereas the visnu-tattva
incarnations of the Lord, such as the Matsya avatara (kesava dhrta-mina-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare), are
called vibhava.

O brahmana; tanuh--the body; vidya--the knowledge derived from Vedic scripture; kriya--spiritual
activities; akrtih--form; angani--the limbs of the body; kratavah--the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices
mentioned in the Vedic literature; jatah--completed; dharmah--the religious principles for executing the
ritualistic ceremonies; atma--My soul; asavah--life airs; surah--the demigods who execute My orders in
different departments of the material world.
My dear brahmana, austerity in the form of meditation is My heart, Vedic knowledge in the form of
hymns and mantras constitutes My body, and spiritual activities and ecstatic emotions are My actual form.
The ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices, when properly conducted, are the various limbs of My body, the
unseen good fortune proceeding from pious or spiritual activities constitutes My mind, and the demigods
who execute My orders in various departments are My life and soul.
Sometimes atheists argue that since God is invisible to their eyes, they do not believe in God. For them
the Supreme Lord is describing a method by which one can see God in His impersonal form. Intelligent
persons can see God in His personal form, as stated in the sastras, but if one is very eager to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately, face to face, he can see the Supreme Lord through this
description, which portrays the various internal and external parts of His body.
To engage in tapasya, or denial of material activities, is the first principle of spiritual life. Then there are
spiritual activities, such as the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, study of the Vedic knowledge,
meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. One
should also respect the demigods and understand how they are situated, how they act and how they
manage the activities of the various departments of this material world. In this way one can see how God
is existing and how everything is managed perfectly because of the presence of the Supreme Lord. As the
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.10):
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and
nonmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." If one is
unable to see the Supreme Lord although He is present as Krsna in His various incarnations, one may see
the Supreme Lord's impersonal feature, according to the direction of the Vedas, by seeing the activities of
material nature.
Anything done under the direction of the Vedic injunctions is called dharma, as described by the order
carriers of Yamaraja (Bhag. 6.1.40):
veda-pranihito dharmo
hy adharmas tad-viparyayah
vedo narayanah saksat
svayambhur iti susruma
"That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of
that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, and are self-born.
This we have heard from Yamaraja."
In this connection, Srila Madhvacarya comments:
tapo 'bhimani rudras tu
visnor hrdayam asritah
vidya rupa tathaivoma
visnos tanum upasrita
srngarady-akrti-gatah
kriyatma paka-sasanah

The various demigods are all acting under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
according to their various actions the demigods are differently named.

aham evasam evagre

aham--I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; eva--only; asam--was; eva--certainly; agre--in the
beginning, before the creation; na--not; anyat--other; kinca--anything; antaram--besides Me; bahih--
external (since the cosmic manifestation is external to the spiritual world, the spiritual world existed
when there was no material world); samjnana-matram--only the consciousness of the living entities;
avyaktam--unmanifested; prasuptam--sleeping; iva--like; visvatah--all over.
Before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, I alone existed with My specific spiritual potencies.
Consciousness was then unmanifested, just as one's consciousness is unmanifested during the time of
sleep.
The word aham indicates a person. As explained in the Vedas, nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam: the
Lord is the supreme eternal among innumerable eternals and the supreme living being among the
innumerable living beings. The Lord is a person who also has impersonal features. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." Consideration of the Paramatma and impersonal Brahman arose after the
creation; before the creation, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead existed. As firmly declared in
Bhagavad-gita (18.55), the Lord can be understood only by bhakti-yoga. The ultimate cause, the supreme
cause of creation, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can be understood only by bhakti-yoga. He
cannot be understood by speculative philosophical research or by meditation, since all such processes
came into existence after the material creation. The impersonal and localized conceptions of the Supreme
Lord are more or less materially contaminated. The real spiritual process, therefore, is bhakti-yoga. As the
Lord says, bhaktya mam abhijanati: "Only by devotional service can I be understood." Before the creation,
the Lord existed as a person, as indicated here by the word aham. When Prajapati Daksa saw Him as a
person, who was beautifully dressed and ornamented, he actually experienced the meaning of this word
aham through devotional service.
Each person is eternal. Because the Lord says that He existed as a person before the creation (agre) and
will also exist after the annihilation, the Lord is a person eternally. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura
therefore quotes these verses from Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.9.13-14):
na cantar na bahir yasya
na purvam napi caparam
purvaparam bahis cantar
jagato yo jagac ca yah
tam matvatmajam avyaktam
martya-lingam adhoksajam
gopikolukhale damna
babandha prakrtam yatha
The Personality of Godhead appeared in Vrndavana as the son of mother Yasoda, who bound the Lord
with rope just as an ordinary mother binds a material child. There are actually no divisions of external
and internal for the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha), but when He
appears in His own form the unintelligent think Him an ordinary person. Avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam: although He comes in His own body, which never changes. mudhas, the
unintelligent, think that the impersonal Brahman has assumed a material body to come in the form of a
person. Ordinary living beings assume material bodies, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not.
Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme consciousness, it is stated herein that samjnanamatram,
the original consciousness, Krsna consciousness, was unmanifested before the creation, although
the consciousness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything. The Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (2.12), "Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in
the future shall any of us cease to be." Thus the Lord's person is the Absolute Truth in the past, present
and future.
In this regard, Madhvacarya quotes two verses from the Matsya Purana:
nana-varno haris tv eko
bahu-sirsa-bhujo rupat
asil laye tad-anyat tu
suksma-rupam sriyam vina
asuptah supta iva ca
militakso 'bhavad dharih
anyatranadarad visnau
sris ca lineva kathyate
suksmatvena harau sthanal
linam anyad apisyate
After the annihilation of everything, the Supreme Lord, because of His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, remains
in His original form, but since the other living entities have material bodies, the matter merges into
matter, and the subtle form of the spirit soul remains within the body of the Lord. The Lord does not
sleep, but the ordinary living entities remain asleep until the next creation. An unintelligent person thinks
that the opulence of the Supreme Lord is nonexistent after the annihilation, but that is not a fact. The
opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains as it is in the spiritual world; only in the
material world is everything dissolved. Brahma-lina, merging into the Supreme Brahman, is not actual
lina, or annihilation, for the subtle form remaining in the Brahman effulgence will return to the material
world after the material creation and again assume a material form. This is described as bhutva bhutva
praliyate. When the material body is annihilated, the spirit soul remains in a subtle form, which later
assumes another material body. This is true for the conditioned souls, but the Supreme Personality of
Godhead remains eternally in His original consciousness and spiritual body.

I am the reservoir of unlimited potency, and therefore I am known as unlimited or all-pervading. From
My material energy the cosmic manifestation appeared within Me, and in this universal manifestation
appeared the chief being, Lord Brahma, who is your source and is not born of a material mother.
This is a description of the history of the universal creation. The first cause is the Lord Himself, the
Supreme Person. From Him, Brahma is created, and Brahma takes charge of the affairs of the universe.
The universal affairs of the material creation depend upon the material energy of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is therefore the cause of the material creation. The entire cosmic manifestation is
described herein as guna-vigrahah, the form of the Lord's qualities. From the cosmic universal form, the
first creation is Lord Brahma, who is the cause of all living entities. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya
describes the unlimited attributes of the Lord:

ato 'nanta-guno visnur

Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate: the Lord has innumerable potencies, all of which are unlimited.
Therefore the Lord Himself and all His qualities, forms, pastimes and paraphernalia are also unlimited.
Because Lord Visnu has unlimited attributes, He is known as Ananta.

When the chief lord of the universe, Lord Brahma [Svayambhu], having been inspired by My energy,
was attempting to create, he thought himself incapable. Therefore I gave him advice, and in accordance
with My instructions he underwent extremely difficult austerities. Because of these austerities, the great
Lord Brahma was able to create nine personalities, including you, to help him in the functions of creation.
Nothing is possible without tapasya. Lord Brahma, however, was empowered to create this entire
universe because of his austerities. The more we engage in austerities, the more we become powerful by
the grace of the Lord. Therefore Rsabhadeva advised His sons, tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed: "One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service.
By such activity, one's heart is purified." (Bhag. 5.5.1) In our material existence we are impure, and
therefore we cannot do anything wonderful, but if we purify our existence by tapasya, we can do
wonderful things by the grace of the Lord. Therefore tapasya is very important, as stressed in this verse.

Now unite in sexual life as man and woman, and in this way, by sexual intercourse, you will be able to
beget hundreds of children in the womb of this girl to increase the population.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo 'smi: "I am sex that is not
contrary to religious principles." Sexual intercourse ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
dharma, a religious principle, but it is not intended for sense enjoyment. Indulgence in sense enjoyment
through sexual intercourse is not allowed by the Vedic principles. One may follow the natural tendency
for sex life only to beget children. Therefore the Lord told Daksa in this verse, "This girl is offered to you
only for sex life to beget children, not for any other purpose. She is very fertile, and therefore you will be
able to have as many children as you can beget."
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks in this connection that Daksa was given the facility for
unlimited sexual intercourse. In Daksa's previous life he was also known as Daksa, but in the course of
performing sacrifices he offended Lord Siva, and thus his head was replaced with that of a goat. Then
Daksa gave up his life because of his degraded condition, but because he maintained the same unlimited
sexual desires, he underwent austerities by which he satisfied the Supreme Lord, who then gave him
unlimited potency for sexual intercourse.
It should be noted that although such a facility for sexual intercourse is achieved by the grace of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, this facility is not offered to advanced devotees, who are free from
material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam). In this connection it may be noted that if the American boys and
girls engaged in the Krsna consciousness movement want to advance in Krsna consciousness to achieve
the supreme benefit of loving service to the Lord, they should refrain from indulging in this facility for sex
life. Therefore we advise that one should at least refrain from illicit sex. Even if there are opportunities for
sex life, one should voluntarily accept the limitation of having sex only for progeny, not for any other
purpose. Kardama Muni was also given the facility for sex life, but he had only a slight desire for it.
Therefore after begetting children in the womb of Devahuti, Kardama Muni became completely
renounced. The purport is that if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one should voluntarily
refrain from sex life. Sex should be accepted only as much as needed, not unlimitedly.
One should not think that Daksa received the favor of the Lord by receiving the facilities for unlimited
sex. Later verses will reveal that Daksa again committed an offense, this time at the lotus feet of Narada.
Therefore although sex life is the topmost enjoyment in the material world and although one may have an
opportunity for sexual enjoyment by the grace of God, this entails a risk of committing offenses. Daksa
was open to such offenses, and therefore, strictly speaking, he was not actually favored by the Supreme
Lord. One should not seek the favor of the Lord for unlimited potency in sex life.

Chapter Five
Narada Muni Cursed by Prajapati Daksa
This chapter relates how all the sons of Daksa were delivered from the clutches of the material energy
by following the advice of Narada, who was therefore cursed by Daksa.
Influenced by the external energy of Lord Visnu, Prajapati Daksa begot ten thousand sons in the womb
of his wife, Pancajani. These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the
Haryasvas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Haryasvas went west to the
place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the site of a
holy lake named Narayana-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Haryasvas began practicing
austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of
life. However, when Srila Narada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply
for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency. Narada Muni described to
the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary karmis to beget children.
Thus all the sons of Daksa became enlightened and left, never to return.
Prajapati Daksa, who was very sad at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of
his wife, Pancajani, and ordered them to increase progeny. These sons, who were named the Savalasvas,
also engaged in worshiping Lord Visnu to beget children, but Narada Muni convinced them to become
mendicants and not beget children. Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Prajapati Daksa
became most angry at Narada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay
anywhere. Since Narada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Daksa's curse.

The great sage Narada said: My dear Haryasvas, you have not seen the extremities of the earth. There is
a kingdom where only one man lives and where there is a hole from which, having entered, no one
emerges. A woman there who is extremely unchaste adorns herself with various attractive dresses, and the
man who lives there is her husband. In that kingdom, there is a river flowing in both directions, a
wonderful home made of twenty-five materials, a swan that vibrates various sounds, and an automatically
revolving object made of sharp razors and thunderbolts. You have not seen all this, and therefore you are
inexperienced boys without advanced knowledge. How, then, will you create progeny?
Narada Muni saw that the boys known as the Haryasvas were already purified because of living in that
holy place and were practically ready for liberation. Why then should they be encouraged to become
entangled in family life, which is so dark that once having entered it one cannot leave it? Through this
analogy, Narada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father's order to be entangled
in family life. Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the
Supersoul, Lord Visnu, for then they would truly be experienced. In other words, one who is too involved
in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the
illusory energy. Narada Muni's purpose was to get the sons of Prajapati Daksa to divert their attention
toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of
propagation. The same advice was given by Prahlada Maharaja to his father (Bhag. 7.5.5):
tat sadhu manye 'sura-varya dehinam
sada samudvigna-dhiyam asad-grahat
hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam
vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta
In the dark well of family life, one is always full of anxiety because of having accepted a temporary
body. If one wants to free himself from this anxiety, one should immediately leave family life and take
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana. Narada Muni advised the Haryasvas not to
enter household life. Since they were already advanced in spiritual knowledge, why should they be
entangled in that way?

bhuh--the earth; ksetram--the field of activities; jiva-samjnam--the designation of the spiritual living
being who is bound by different results of activity; yat--which; anadi--existing since time immemorial;
nija-bandhanam--causing his own bondage; adrstva--without seeing; tasya--of this; nirvanam--the
cessation; kim--what benefit; asat-karmabhih--with temporary fruitive activities; bhavet--there can be.
[The Haryasvas understood the meaning of Narada's words as follows.] The word "bhuh" ["the earth"]
refers to the field of activities. The material body, which is a result of the living being's actions, is his field
of activities, and it gives him false designations. Since time immemorial, he has received various types of
material bodies, which are the roots of bondage to the material world. If one foolishly engages in
temporary fruitive activities and does not look toward the cessation of this bondage, what will be the
benefit of his actions?
Narada Muni spoke to the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, about ten allegorical subjects--the
king, the kingdom, the river, the house, the physical elements and so forth. After considering these by
themselves, the Haryasvas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness,
but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement. This is a very important verse, since all
the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies. A
man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense
gratification all day and night. Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various
activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body. Especially in the human form of body,
one's duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the
instructions of Narada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily
activities to enjoy maya-sukha--flickering, temporary happiness. They do not know how to become free
from their material encagement. Rsabhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it
encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition.
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, could immediately understand the purport of Narada's
instructions. Our Krsna consciousness movement is especially meant for such enlightenment. We are
trying to enlighten humanity so that people may come to the understanding that they should work hard
in tapasya for self-realization and freedom from the continuous bondage of birth, death, old age and
disease in one body after another. Maya, however, is very strong; she is expert in putting impediments in
the way of this understanding. Therefore sometimes one comes to the Krsna consciousness movement but
again falls into the clutches of maya, not understanding the importance of this movement.

[Narada Muni had said that there is a kingdom where there is only one male. The Haryasvas realized the
purport of this statement.] The only enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who observes
everything, everywhere. He is full of six opulences and fully independent of everyone else. He is never
subject to the three modes of material nature, for He is always transcendental to this material creation. If
the members of human society do not understand Him, the Supreme, through their advancement in
knowledge and activities, but simply work very hard like cats and dogs all day and night for temporary
happiness, what will be the benefit of their activities?
Narada Muni had mentioned a kingdom where there is only one king with no competitor. The complete
spiritual world, and specifically the cosmic manifestation, has only one proprietor or enjoyer--the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond this material manifestation. The Lord has therefore been
described as turya, existing on the fourth platform. He has also been described as abhava. The word
bhava, which means "takes birth," comes from the word bhu, "to be." As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.19),
bhutva bhutva praliyate: the living entities in the material world must be repeatedly born and destroyed.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is neither bhutva nor praliyate; He is eternal. In other
words, He is not obliged to take birth like human beings or animals, which repeatedly take birth and die
because of ignorance of the soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not subjected to such
changes of body, and one who thinks otherwise is considered a fool (avajananti mam mudha manusim
tanum asritam). Narada Muni advises that human beings not waste their time simply jumping like cats
and monkeys, without real benefit. The duty of the human being is to understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

[Narada Muni had described that there is a bila, or hole, from which, having entered, one does not
return. The Haryasvas understood the meaning of this allegory.] Hardly once has a person who has
entered the lower planetary system called Patala been seen to return. Similarly, if one enters the
Vaikuntha-dhama [pratyag-dhama], he does not return to this material world. If there is such a place,
from which, having gone, one does not return to the miserable material condition of life, what is the use
of jumping like monkeys in the temporary material world and not seeing or understanding that place?
What will be the profit?
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.6), yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama: there is a region
from which, having gone, one does not return to the material world. This region has been repeatedly
described. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), Krsna says:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
If one can properly understand Krsna, who has already been described as the Supreme King, he does not
return here after giving up his material body. This fact has been described in this verse of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Puman naivaiti yad gatva: he does not return to this material world, but returns home, back
to Godhead, to live an eternally blissful life of knowledge. Why do people not care about this? What will
be the benefit of taking birth again in this material world, sometimes as a human being, sometimes a
demigod and sometimes a cat or dog? What is the benefit of wasting time in this way? Krsna has very
definitely asserted in Bhagavad-gita (8.15):
mam upetya punar janma
duhkhalayam asasvatam
napnuvanti mahatmanah
samsiddhim paramam gatah
"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world,
which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection." One's real concern should be
to free himself from the repetition of birth and death and attain the topmost perfection of life by living
with the Supreme King in the spiritual world. In these verses the sons of Daksa repeatedly say, kim asatkarmabhir
bhavet: "What is the use of impermanent fruitive activities?"

[Narada Muni had described a woman who is a professional prostitute. The Haryasvas understood the
identity of this woman.] Mixed with the mode of passion, the unsteady intelligence of every living entity
is like a prostitute who changes dresses just to attract one's attention. If one fully engages in temporary
fruitive activities, not understanding how this is taking place, what does he actually gain?
A woman who has no husband declares herself independent, which means that she becomes a
prostitute. A prostitute generally dresses herself in various fashions intended to attract a man's attention
to the lower part of her body. Today it has become a much advertised fashion for a woman to go almost
naked, covering the lower part of her body only slightly, in order to draw the attention of a man to her
private parts for sexual enjoyment. The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body
is the intelligence of a professional prostitute. Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not
turn his attention toward Krsna or the Krsna consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a
prostitute. What is the benefit of such foolish intelligence? One should be intelligently conscious in such
a way that he need no longer change from one body to another.
Karmis change their professions at any moment, but a Krsna conscious person does not change his
profession, for his only profession is to attract the attention of Krsna by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra
and living a very simple life, without following daily changes of fashion. In our Krsna consciousness
movement, fashionable persons are taught to adopt one fashion--the dress of a Vaisnava with a shaved
head and tilaka. They are taught to be always clean in mind, dress and eating in order to be fixed in Krsna
consciousness. What is the use of changing one's dress, sometimes wearing long hair and a long beard and
sometimes dressing otherwise? This is not good. One should not waste his time in such frivolous
activities. One should always be fixed in Krsna consciousness and take the cure of devotional service with
firm determination.

one who does not know; iha--in this world; kim asat-karmabhih bhavet--what can be the benefit of
performing temporary fruitive activities.
[Narada Muni had also spoken of a man who is the husband of the prostitute. The Haryasvas
understood this as follows.] If one becomes the husband of a prostitute, he loses all independence.
Similarly, if a living entity has polluted intelligence, he prolongs his materialistic life. Frustrated by
material nature, he must follow the movements of the intelligence, which brings various conditions of
happiness and distress. If one performs fruitive activities under such conditions, what will be the benefit?
Polluted intelligence has been compared to a prostitute. One who has not purified his intelligence is said
to be controlled by that prostitute. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.41), vyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kurunandana:
those who are actually serious are conducted by one kind of intelligence, namely, intelligence in
Krsna consciousness. Bahu-sakha hy anantas ca buddhayo 'vyavasayinam: one who is not fixed in proper
intelligence discovers many modes of life. Thus involved in material activities, he is exposed to the
different modes of material nature and subjected to varieties of so-called happiness and distress. If a man
becomes the husband of a prostitute, he cannot be happy, and similarly one who follows the dictations of
material intelligence and material consciousness will never be happy.
One must judiciously understand the activities of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27):
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to
be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." Although one follows the dictations
of material nature, he happily thinks himself the master or husband of material nature. Scientists, for
example, try to be the masters of material nature, life after life, not caring to understand the Supreme
Person, under whose direction everything within this material world is moving. Trying to be the masters
of material nature, they are imitation gods who declare to the public that scientific advancement will one
day be able to avoid the so-called control of God. In fact, however, the living being, unable to control the
rulings of God, is forced to associate with the prostitute of polluted intelligence and accept various
material bodies. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.22):
purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhunkte prakrti-jan gunan
karanam guna-sango 'sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.
This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various
species." If one fully engages in temporary fruitive activities and does not solve this real problem, what
profit will he gain?

temporary fruitive activities.
[Narada Muni had said that there is a river flowing in both directions. The Haryasvas understood the
purport of this statement.] Material nature functions in two ways--by creation and dissolution. Thus the
river of material nature flows both ways. A living entity who unknowingly falls in this river is submerged
in its waves, and since the current is swifter near the banks of the river, he is unable to get out. What will
be the benefit of performing fruitive activities in that river of maya?
One may be submerged in the waves of the river of maya, but one may also get free from the waves by
coming to the banks of knowledge and austerity. Near these banks, however, the waves are very strong. If
one does not understand how he is being tossed by the waves, but simply engages in temporary fruitive
activities, what benefit will he derive?
In the Brahma-samhita (5.44) there is this statement:
srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka
chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga
The maya-sakti, Durga, is in charge of srsti-sthiti-pralaya, creation and dissolution, and she acts under
the direction of the Supreme Lord (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram). When one falls in the
river of nescience, he is always tossed here and there by the waves, but the same maya can also save him
when be surrenders to Krsna, or becomes Krsna conscious. Krsna consciousness is knowledge and
austerity. A Krsna conscious person takes knowledge from the Vedic literature, and at the same time he
must practice austerities.
To attain freedom from material life, one must take to Krsna consciousness. Otherwise, if one very
busily engages in the so-called advancement of science, what benefit will he derive? If one is carried away
by the waves of nature, what is the meaning of being a great scientist or philosopher? Mundane science
and philosophy are also material creations. One must understand how maya works and how one can be
released from the tossing waves of the river of nescience. That is one's first duty.

[Narada Muni had said that there is a house made of twenty-five elements. The Haryasvas understood
this analogy.] The Supreme Lord is the reservoir of the twenty-five elements, and as the Supreme Being,
the conductor of cause and effect, He causes their manifestation. If one engages in temporary fruitive
activities, not knowing that Supreme Person, what benefit will he derive?
Philosophers and scientists conduct scholarly research to find the original cause, but they should do so
scientifically, not whimsically or through fantastic theories. The science of the original cause is explained
in various Vedic literatures. Athato brahma jijnasa.janmady asya yatah. The Vedanta-sutra explains that
one should inquire about the Supreme Soul. Such inquiry about the Supreme is called brahma jijnasa. The
Absolute Truth, tattva, is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." The Absolute Truth appears to neophytes as impersonal Brahman and to
advanced mystic yogis as Paramatma, the Supersoul, but devotees, who are further advanced, understand
the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Lord, Visnu.
This material cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the energy of Lord Krsna, or Lord Visnu.
eka-desa-sthitasyagner
jyotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah saktis
tathedam akhilam jagat
"Whatever we see in this world is but an expansion of various energies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is like a fire that spreads illumination for a long distance although it is situated in one
place." (Visnu Purana) The entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if
one does not conduct research to find the supreme cause, but instead falsely engages in frivolous,
temporary activities, what is the use of demanding recognition as an important scientist or philosopher? If
one does not know the ultimate cause, what is the use of his scientific and philosophical research?
The purusa, the original person--Bhagavan, Visnu--can be understood only by devotional service.
Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: only by devotional service can one understand the
Supreme Person, who is behind everything. One must try to understand that the material elements are the
separated, inferior energy of the Lord and that the living entity is the Lord's spiritual energy. Whatever we
experience, including matter and the spirit soul, the living force, is but a combination of two energies of
Lord Visnu--the inferior energy and the superior energy. One should seriously study the facts concerning
creation, maintenance and devastation, as well as the permanent place from which one never need return
(yad gatva na nivartante). Human society should study this, but instead of culturing such knowledge,
people are attracted to temporary happiness and sense gratification, culminating in bottomless, topless
passion. There is no profit in such activities; one must engage himself in the Krsna consciousness
movement.

[Narada Muni had spoken of a swan. That swan is explained in this verse.] The Vedic literatures
[sastras] vividly describe how to understand the Supreme Lord, the source of all material and spiritual
energy. Indeed, they elaborately explain these two energies. The swan [hamsa] is one who discriminates
between matter and spirit, who accepts the essence of everything, and who explains the means of bondage
and the means of liberation. The words of scriptures consist of variegated vibrations. If a foolish rascal
leaves aside the study of these sastras to engage in temporary activities, what will be the result?
The Krsna consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages,
especially Western languages such as English, French and German. The leaders of the Western world, the
Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are
very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization. A sane man,
however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have
nothing to do with eternal life. The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and
therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people
knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages.
The word vivikta-padam refers to the path of logical discourses concerning the aim of life. If one does
not discuss that which is important in life, one is put into darkness and must struggle for existence. What,
then, is the benefit of his advancement in knowledge? The people of the West are seeing their students
becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education. The Krsna consciousness
movement, however, is trying to convert misguided, drug-addicted students to the service of Krsna and
engage them in the best welfare activities for human society.

Even a moment of one's lifetime could not be returned in exchange for millions of dollars. Therefore
one should consider how much loss one suffers if he wastes even a moment of his life for nothing. Living
like an animal, not understanding the goal of life, one foolishly thinks that there is no eternity and that his
life span of fifty, sixty, or, at the most, one hundred years, is everything. This is the greatest foolishness.
Time is eternal, and in the material world one passes through different phases of his eternal life. Time is
compared herein to a sharp razor. A razor is meant to shave the hair from one's face, but if not carefully
handled, the razor will cause disaster. One is advised not to create a disaster by misusing his lifetime. One
should be extremely careful to utilize the span of his life for spiritual realization, or Krsna consciousness.

sastrasya pitur adesam
yo na veda nivartakam
katham tad-anurupaya
guna-visrambhy upakramet
sastrasya--of the scriptures; pituh--of the father; adesam--the instruction; yah--one who; na--not; veda--
understands; nivartakam--which brings about the cessation of the material way of life; katham--how; tatanurupaya--
to follow the instruction of the sastras; guna-visrambhi--a person entangled in the three
modes of material nature; upakramet--can engage in the creation of progeny.
[Narada Muni had asked how one could ignorantly defy one's own father. The Haryasvas understood
the meaning of this question.] One must accept the original instructions of the sastra. According to Vedic
civilization, one is offered a sacred thread as a sign of second birth. One takes his second birth by dint of
having received instructions in the sastra from a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore, sastra, scripture, is
the real father. All the sastras instruct that one should end his material way of life. If one does not know
the purpose of the father's orders, the sastras, he is ignorant. The words of a material father who
endeavors to engage his son in material activities are not the real instructions of the father.
Bhagavad-gita (16.7) says, pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidur asurah: demons, who are less than
human beings but are not called animals, do not know the meaning of pravrtti and nivrtti, work to be
done and work not to be done. In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the
material world as much as possible. This is called pravrtti-marga. All the sastras, however, advise nivrttimarga,
or release from the materialistic way of life. Apart from the sastras of the Vedic civilization, which
is the oldest of the world, other sastras agree on this point. For example, in the Buddhist sastras Lord
Buddha advises that one achieve nirvana by giving up the materialistic way of life. In the Bible, which is
also sastra, one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of
God. In any sastra one may examine, especially the Vedic sastra, the same advice is given: one should give
up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life. Sankaracarya also propounds the same
conclusion. Brahma satyam jagan mithya: this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and
therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman.
The word sastra refers to the scriptures, particularly the Vedic books of knowledge. The Vedas--Sama,
Yajur, Rg and Atharva--and any other books deriving knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic
literatures. Bhagavad-gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose
instructions should be especially accepted. In this essence of all sastras, Krsna personally advises that one
give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja).
One should be initiated into following the principles of sastra. In offering initiation, our Krsna
consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of sastra by taking the advice of the supreme
speaker of the sastra, Krsna, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life. Therefore the
principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. These four types
of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home,
back to Godhead.
In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including
even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother. Therefore, getting a
material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a
father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and
their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated
in the sastras, he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they
are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by
Rsabhadeva (Bhag. 5.5.18): pita na sa syaj janani na sa syat. na mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum. One
should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one's dependent son from the
impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such
fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father
and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according
to the Vedic system it is said, janmana jayate sudrah: one is born of a material father and mother as a
sudra. The purpose of life, however, is to become a brahmana, a first-class man.
A first-class intelligent man is called a brahmana because he knows the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute
Truth. According to the Vedic instructions, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: to know this
science, one must approach a bona fide guru, a spiritual master who will initiate the disciple with the
sacred thread so that he may understand the Vedic knowledge. Janmana jayate sudrah samskarad dhi
bhaved dvijah. Becoming a brahmana through the endeavor of a bona fide spiritual master is called
samskara. After initiation, one is engaged in study of the sastra, which teaches the student how to gain
release from materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead.
The Krsna consciousness movement is teaching this higher knowledge of retiring from materialistic life
to return to Godhead, but unfortunately many parents are not very satisfied with this movement. Aside
from the parents of our students, many businessmen are also dissatisfied because we teach our students to
abandon intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling. If the Krsna consciousness movement
spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette
factories. Therefore they are also very much afraid. However, we have no alternative than to teach our
disciples to free themselves from materialistic life. We must instruct them in the opposite of material life
to save them from the repetition of birth and death.
Narada Muni, therefore, advised the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, that instead of begetting
progeny, it would be better to leave and achieve the perfection of spiritual understanding according to the
instructions of the sastras. The importance of the sastras is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (16.23):
yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na sukham na param gatim
"One who disregards the injunctions of the sastras and acts whimsically, as he likes, never achieves the
perfection of life, not to speak of happiness. Nor does he return home to the spiritual world."

iti vyavasita rajan

iti--thus; vyavasitah--being fully convinced by the instructions of Narada Muni; rajan--O King;
haryasvah--the sons of Prajapati Daksa; eka-cetasah--all being of the same opinion; prayayuh--left; tam--
Narada Muni; parikramya--circumambulating; panthanam--on the path; anivartanam--which does not
bring one back again to this material world.
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after hearing the instructions of Narada, the Haryasvas,
the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were firmly convinced. They all believed in his instructions and reached the
same conclusion. Having accepted him as their spiritual master, they circumambulated that great sage and
followed the path by which one never returns to this world.
From this verse we can understand the meaning of initiation and the duties of a disciple and spiritual
master. The spiritual master never instructs his disciple, "Take a mantra from me, pay me some money,
and by practicing this yoga system you will become very expert in materialistic life." This is not the duty
of a spiritual master. Rather, the spiritual master teaches the disciple how to give up materialistic life, and
the disciple's duty is to assimilate his instructions and ultimately follow the path back home, back to
Godhead, from whence no one returns to this material world.
After hearing the instructions of Narada Muni, the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, decided not
to be entangled in materialistic life by begetting hundreds of children and having to take care of them.
This would have been unnecessarily entangling. The Haryasvas did not consider pious and impious
activities. Their materialistic father had instructed them to increase the population, but because of the
words of Narada Muni, they could not heed that instruction. Narada Muni, as their spiritual master, gave
them the sastric instructions that they should give up this material world, and as bona fide disciples they
followed his instructions. One should not endeavor to wander to different planetary systems within this
universe, for even if one goes to the topmost planetary system, Brahmaloka, one must return again (ksine
punye martya-lokam visanti). The endeavors of karmis are a useless waste of time. One should endeavor
to return home, back to Godhead. This is the perfection of life. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein
repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth
again."

svara-brahmani nirbhatahrsikesa-
padambuje
akhandam cittam avesya
lokan anucaran munih
svara-brahmani--in spiritual sound; nirbhata--placing clearly before the mind; hrsikesa--of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the master of the senses; padambuje--the lotus feet; akhandam--unbroken;
cittam--consciousness; avesya--engaging; lokan--all the planetary systems; anucarat--traveled around;
munih--the great sage Narada Muni.
The seven musical notes--sa, r, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni--are used in musical instruments, but originally
they come from the Sama Veda. The great sage Narada vibrates sounds describing the pastimes of the
Supreme Lord. By such transcendental vibrations, such as Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, he fixes his mind at the lotus feet of the Lord. Thus
he directly perceives Hrsikesa, the master of the senses. After delivering the Haryasvas, Narada Muni
continued traveling throughout the planetary systems, his mind always fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord.
The goodness of the great sage Narada Muni is described herewith. He always chants about the pastimes
of the Lord and delivers the fallen souls back to Godhead. In this regard, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has
sung:
narada-muni, bajaya vina,
'radhika-ramana'-name
nama amani, udita haya,
bhakata-gita-same
amiya-dhara, varise ghana,
sravana-yugale giya
bhakata-jana, saghane nace,
bhariya apana hiya
madhuri-pura, asaba pasi',
mataya jagata-jane
keha va kande, keha va nace,
keha mate mane mane
panca-vadana, narade dhari',
premera saghana rola
kamalasana, naciya bale,
'bola bola hari bola'
sahasranana, parama-sukhe,
'hari hari' bali' gaya
nama-prabhave, matila visva,
nama-rasa sabe paya
sri-krsna-nama, rasane sphuri',
pura'la amara asa
sri-rupa-pade, yacaye iha,
bhakativinoda dasa
The purport of this song is that Narada Muni, the great soul, plays a stringed instrument called a vina,
vibrating the sound radhika-ramana, which is another name for Krsna. As soon as he strokes the strings,
all the devotees begin responding, making a very beautiful vibration. Accompanied by the stringed
instrument, the singing seems like a shower of nectar, and all the devotees dance in ecstasy to the fullest
extent of their satisfaction. While dancing, they appear madly intoxicated with ecstasy, as if drinking the
beverage called madhuri-pura. Some of them cry, some of them dance, and some of them, although
unable to dance publicly, dance within their hearts. Lord Siva embraces Narada Muni and begins talking
in an ecstatic voice, and seeing Lord Siva dancing with Narada, Lord Brahma also joins, saying, "All of you
kindly chant 'Hari bol! Hari bol!' " The King of heaven, Indra, also gradually joins with great satisfaction
and begins dancing and chanting "Hari bol! Hari bol!" In this way, by the influence of the transcendental
vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe becomes ecstatic. Bhaktivinoda Thakura says,
"When the universe becomes ecstatic, my desire is satisfied. I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of Rupa
Gosvami that this chanting of harer nama may go on nicely like this."
Lord Brahma is the guru of Narada Muni, who is the guru of Vyasadeva, and Vyasadeva is the guru of
Madhvacarya. Thus the Gaudiya-Madhva-sampradaya is in the disciplic succession from Narada Muni.
The members of this disciplic succession--in other words, the members of the Krsna consciousness
movement--should follow in the footsteps of Narada Muni by chanting the transcendental vibration Hare
Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. They should
go everywhere to deliver the fallen souls by vibrating the Hare Krsna mantra and the instructions of
Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya-caritamrta. That will please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One can spiritually advance if one actually follows the instructions of Narada Muni. If one
pleases Narada Muni, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hrsikesa, is also pleased (yasya prasadad
bhagavat-prasadah). The immediate spiritual master is the representative of Narada Muni; there is no
difference between the instructions of Narada Muni and those of the present spiritual master. Both Narada
Muni and the present spiritual master speak the same teachings of Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita
(18.65-66):
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo 'si me
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you
will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend. Abandon all
varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear."

nasam--the loss; nisamya--hearing of; putranam--of his sons; naradat--from Narada; sila-salinam--who
were the best of well-behaved persons; anvatapyata--suffered; kah--Prajapati Daksa; socan--lamenting; suprajastvam--
having ten thousand well-behaved sons; sucam--of lamentation; padam--position.
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately,
because of the instructions of Narada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father. When Daksa
heard this news, which was brought to him by Narada Muni, he began to lament. Although he was the
father of such good sons, he had lost them all. Certainly this was lamentable.
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were certainly Hell behaved, learned and advanced, and in
accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their
family. But Narada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to
be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs.
The Haryasvas abided by the order of Narada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Prajapati
Daksa, the prajapati, instead of being happy with the actions of Narada Muni, was extremely sorrowful.
Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the Krsna consciousness movement for
their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are
lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Prajapati Daksa did not make propaganda against
Narada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Daksa cursed Narada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is
the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting
children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not
unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the Krsna
consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the
Krsna consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even Narada Muni was condemned,
not to speak of others. Nevertheless, Narada Muni never gives up his mission. To deliver as many fallen
souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

When Prajapati Daksa was lamenting for his lost children, Lord Brahma pacified him with instructions,
and thereafter Daksa begot one thousand more children in the womb of his wife, Pancajani. This time his
sons were known as the Savalasvas.
Prajapati Daksa was so named because he was very expert in begetting children. (The word daksa means
"expert.") First he begot ten thousand children in the womb of his wife, and when the children were lost--
when they returned home, back to Godhead--he begot another set of children, known as the Savalasvas.
Prajapati Daksa is very expert in begetting children, and Narada Muni is very expert in delivering all the
conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. Therefore the materialistic experts do not agree with the
spiritual expert Narada Muni. but this does not mean that Narada Muni will give up his engagement of
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.

In accordance with their father's order to beget children, the second group of sons also went to
Narayana-saras, the same place where their brothers had previously attained perfection by following the
instructions of Narada. Undertaking great vows of austerity, the Savalasvas remained at that holy place.
Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons to the same place where his previous sons had attained
perfection. He did not hesitate to send his second group of sons to the same place, although they too
might become victims of Narada's instructions. According to the Vedic culture, one should be trained in
spiritual understanding as a brahmacari before entering household life to beget children. This is the Vedic
system. Thus Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons for cultural improvement, despite the risk
that because of the instructions of Narada they might become as intelligent as their older brothers. As a
dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the
perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot
in this material world in various species of life. In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give
cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go. Responsible fathers should not
hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the Krsna consciousness
movement. This is not a father's duty. The duty of a father is to give his son complete freedom to make his
choice after becoming spiritually advanced by following the instructions of the spiritual master.

At Narayana-saras, the second group of sons performed penances in the same way as the first. They
bathed in the holy water, and by its touch all the dirty material desires in their hearts were cleansed away.
They murmured mantras beginning with omkara and underwent a severe course of austerities.
Every Vedic mantra is called brahma because each mantra is preceded by the brahmaksara (aum or
omkara). For example, om namo bhagavate vasudevaya. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7. 8),
pranavah sarva-vedesu: "In all the Vedic mantras, I am represented by pranava, or omkara." Thus
chanting of the Vedic mantras beginning with omkara is directly chanting of Krsna's name. There is no
difference. Whether one chants omkara or addresses the Lord as "Krsna," the meaning is the same, but Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended that in this age one chant the Hare Krsna mantra (harer nama
eva kevalam). Although there is no difference between Hare Krsna and the Vedic mantras beginning with
omkara, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the leader of the spiritual movement for this age, has recommended
that one chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,

For a few months the sons of Prajapati Daksa drank only water and ate only air. Thus undergoing great
austerities, they recited this mantra: "Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Narayana, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is always situated in His transcendental abode. Since He is the Supreme
Person [paramahamsa], let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him."
From these verses it is apparent that the chanting of the maha-mantra or the Vedic mantras must be
accompanied by severe austerities. In Kali-yuga, people cannot undergo severe austerities like those
mentioned herein--drinking only water and eating only air for many months. One cannot imitate such a
process. But at least one must undergo some austerity by giving up four unwanted principles, namely
illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Anyone can easily practice this tapasya, and then the
chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra will be effective without delay. One should not give up the process of
austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the waters of the Ganges or Yamuna, or in the absence of the
Ganges and Yamuna one may bathe in the water of the sea. This is an item of austerity. Our Krsna
consciousness movement has therefore established two very large centers, one in Vrndavana and another
in Mayapur, Navadvipa. There one may bathe in the Ganges or Yamuna, chant the Hare Krsna mantra and
thus become perfect and return home, back to Godhead.

O sons of Daksa, please hear my words of instruction attentively. You are all very affectionate to your

Narada Muni encouraged Prajapati Daksa's second group of sons by awakening their natural affinity for
their brothers. He urged them to follow their older brothers if they were at all affectionate toward them.
Family affection is very strong, and therefore Narada Muni followed this tactic of reminding them of their
family relationship with the Haryasvas. Generally the word nigama refers to the Vedas, but here nigama
refers to the instructions contained in the Vedas. Srimad-Bhagavatam says, nigama-kalpa-taror galitam
phalam: the Vedic instructions are like a tree, of which Srimad-Bhagavatam is the ripened fruit. Narada
Muni is engaged in distributing this fruit, and therefore he instructed Vyasadeva to write this Mahapurana,
Srimad-Bhagavatam, for the benefit of ignorant human society.

"The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by
the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the
learned Vyasadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth." (Bhag.
1.7.6) People are suffering because of ignorance and are following a wrong path for happiness. This is
called anartha. These material activities will never make them happy, and therefore Narada instructed
Vyasadeva to record the instructions of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Vyasadeva actually followed Narada and did
this. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the supreme instruction of the Vedas. Galitam phalam: the ripened fruit of the
Vedas is Srimad-Bhagavatam.

A brother aware of the principles of religion follows in the footsteps of his elder brothers. Because of
being highly elevated, such a pious brother gets the opportunity to associate and enjoy with demigods like
the Maruts, who are all affectionate to their brothers.
According to their belief in various material relationships, people are promoted to various planets. Here
it is said that one who is very faithful to his brothers should follow a path similar to theirs and get the
opportunity for promotion to Marudloka. Narada Muni advised Prajapati Daksa's second group of sons to
follow their elder brothers and be promoted to the spiritual world.

When he heard that the Savalasvas had also left this world to engage in devotional service, Daksa was

Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that Narada Muni had delivered the entire family of
Svayambhuva Manu, beginning with Priyavrata and Uttanapada. He had delivered Uttanapada's son
Dhruva and had even delivered Pracinabarhi, who was engaged in fruitive activities. Nevertheless, he
could not deliver Prajapati Daksa. Prajapati Daksa saw Narada before him because Narada had personally
come to deliver him. Narada Muni took the opportunity to approach Prajapati Daksa in his bereavement
because the time of bereavement is a suitable time for appreciating bhakti-yoga. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(7.16), four kinds of men--arta (one who is distressed), artharthi (one in need of money), jijnasu (one
who is inquisitive) and jnani (a person in knowledge)--try to understand devotional service. Prajapati
Daksa was in great distress because of the loss of his sons, and therefore Narada took the opportunity to
instruct him regarding liberation from material bondage.

sri-daksa uvaca
aho asadho sadhunam
sadhu-lingena nas tvaya
asadhv akary arbhakanam
bhiksor margah pradarsitah
sri-daksah uvaca--Prajapati Daksa said; aho asadho--O greatly dishonest nondevotee; sadhunam--of the
society of devotees and great sages; sadhu-lingena--wearing the dress of a saintly person; nah--unto us;
tvaya--by you; asadhu--a dishonesty; akari--has been done; arbhakanam--of poor boys who were very
inexperienced; bhiksoh margah--the path of a beggar or mendicant sannyasi; pradarsitah--shown.
Prajapati Daksa said: Alas, Narada Muni, you wear the dress of a saintly person, but you are not actually
a saint. Indeed, although I am now in grhastha life, I am a saintly person. By showing my sons the path of
renunciation, you have done me an abominable injustice.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, sannyasira alpa chidra sarva-loke gaya (Cc. Madhya 12. 51). In society
one will find many sannyasis, vanaprasthas, grhasthas and brahmacaris, but if all of them properly live in
accordance with their duties, they are understood to be sadhus. Prajapati Daksa was certainly a sadhu
because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, had
appeared before him. Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality. He improperly thought Narada Muni
to be asadhu, or nonsaintly, because Narada had foiled his intentions. Desiring to train his sons to become
grhasthas fully equipped with knowledge, Daksa had sent them to execute austerities by Narayana-saras.
Narada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to
become Vaisnavas in the renounced order. This is the duty of Narada Muni and his followers. They must
show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead.
Prajapati Daksa, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties Narada Muni performed in relation
to his sons. Unable to appreciate Narada Muni's behavior, Daksa accused Narada of being asadhu.
The words bhiksor marga, "the path of the renounced order," are very significant in this regard. A
sannyasi is called tridandi-bhiksu because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of grhasthas and to give
the grhasthas spiritual instructions. A sannyasi is allowed to beg from door to door, but a grhastha cannot
do so. Grhasthas may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life. A brahmana
grhastha may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He may also assume the duty of worship himself. Therefore
it is said that only brahmanas may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as prasada whatever
people offer the Deity. Although a brahmana may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal
maintenance but for the worship of the Deity. Thus a brahmana does not stock anything for his future
use. Similarly, ksatriyas may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens,
enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order. Vaisyas should earn their livelihood through
agriculture and cow protection, and sudras should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher
classes. Unless one becomes a brahmana, one cannot take sannyasa. Sannyasis and brahmacaris may beg
alms door to door, but a grhastha cannot.
Prajapati Daksa condemned Narada Muni because Narada, a brahmacari who could beg from door to
door, had made sannyasis of Daksa's sons, who were being trained to be grhasthas. Daksa was extremely
angry at Narada because he thought that Narada had done him a great injustice. According to Daksa's
opinion, Narada Muni had misled Daksa's inexperienced sons (asadhv akary arbhakanam). Daksa
regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when Narada showed them the renounced order
of life. Because of all these considerations, Prajapati Daksa charged that Narada Muni was asadhu and
should not have adopted the dress of a sadhu.
Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by grhasthas, especially when he instructs their young
sons to accept Krsna consciousness. Generally a grhastha thinks that unless one enters grhastha life he
cannot properly enter the renounced order. If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced
order in accordance with the instructions of Narada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents
become very angry. This same phenomenon is occurring in our Krsna consciousness movement because
we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation. We
allow grhastha life, but a grhastha also follows the path of renunciation. Even a grhastha has to give up so
many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed. We allow no meat-eating,
no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so
many no's, one's life can be positive. In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities
practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population. Therefore parents sometimes dislike our
movement, just as Prajapati Daksa disliked the activities of Narada and accused Narada of dishonesty.
Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because
we are in the disciplic succession from Narada Muni.
People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of grhastha life, which
is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in Krsna consciousness. They do not
know that the householder's concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a
mendicant. The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one's fiftieth year one must give up
household life. This is compulsory. However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to
remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering. In such cases, the disciples of Narada
Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the Krsna consciousness movement
immediately. There is nothing wrong in this.

rnaih--from the debts; tribhih--three; amuktanam--of persons not freed; amimamsita--not considering;
karmanam--the path of duty; vighatah--ruin; sreyasah--of the path of good fortune; papa--O most sinful
(Narada Muni); lokayoh--of the worlds; ubhayoh--both; krtah--done.
Prajapati Daksa said: My sons were not at all freed from their three debts. Indeed, they did not properly
consider their obligations. O Narada Muni, O personality of sinful action, you have obstructed their
progress toward good fortune in this world and the next because they are still indebted to the saintly
persons, the demigods and their father.
As soon as a brahmana takes birth, he assumes three kinds of debts--debts to great saints, debts to the
demigods and debts to his father. The son of a brahmana must undergo celibacy (brahmacarya) to clear
his debts to the saintly persons, he must perform ritualistic ceremonies to clear his debts to the demigods,
and he must beget children to become free from his debts to his father. Prajapati Daksa argued that
although the renounced order is recommended for liberation, one cannot attain liberation unless one
fulfills his obligations to the demigods, the saints and his father. Since Daksa's sons had not liberated
themselves from these three debts, how could Narada Muni have led them to the renounced order of life?
Apparently, Prajapati Daksa did not know the final decision of the sastras. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.5.41):
devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam
na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan
sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam
gato mukundam parihrtya kartam
Everyone is indebted to the demigods, to living entities in general, to his family, to the pitas and so on,
but if one fully surrenders to Krsna, Mukunda, who can give one liberation, even if one performs no
yajnas, one is freed from all debts. Even if one does not repay his debts, he is freed from all debts if he
renounces the material world for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose lotus feet are the
shelter of everyone. This is the verdict of the sastra. Therefore Narada Muni was completely right in
instructing the sons of Prajapati Daksa to renounce this material world immediately and take shelter of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unfortunately, Prajapati Daksa, the father of the Haryasvas and
Savalasvas, did not understand the great service rendered by Narada Muni. Daksa therefore addressed him
as papa (the personality of sinful activities) and asadhu (a nonsaintly person). Since Narada Muni was a
great saint and Vaisnava, he tolerated all such accusations from Prajapati Daksa. He merely performed his
duty as a Vaisnava by delivering all the sons of Prajapati Daksa, enabling them to return home, back to
Godhead.

Supreme Personality of Godhead; nirapatrapah--(although you do not know what you are doing, you are

Prajapati Daksa continued: Thus committing violence against other living entities and yet claiming to be
an associate of Lord Visnu, you are defaming the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You needlessly created
a mentality of renunciation in innocent boys, and therefore you are shameless and devoid of compassion.
How could you travel with the personal associates of the Supreme Lord ?
This mentality of Prajapati Daksa still continues even today. When young boys join the Krsna
consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the
Krsna consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to
deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. Karmis, fruitive
workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some
pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A yogi,
however, especially a bhakti-yogi, is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in
traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic
civilization. As stated by Prabodhananda Sarasvati, kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate: for
a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the
demigods is a will-o'-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all. A pure devotee is not
interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is
interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Prajapati Daksa was a karmi, he
could not appreciate the great service Narada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he
accused Narada Muni of being sinful and charged that because Narada Muni was associated with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Daksa criticized that Narada
Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.

All the devotees of the Lord but you are very kind to the conditioned souls and are eager to benefit
others. Although you wear the dress of a devotee, you create enmity with people who are not your
enemies, or you break friendship and create enmity between friends. Are you not ashamed of posing as a
devotee while performing these abominable actions?
Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of Narada Muni in the disciplic succession.
Through the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and
return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated
neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this Krsna
consciousness movement. In India the caste brahmanas have become enemies of the Krsna consciousness
movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be mlecchas and yavanas, to the position of
brahmanas. We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as brahmanas by awarding
them sacred threads. Thus the caste brahmanas of India are very displeased by our activities in the
Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also
become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will
always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the sastras, a devotee should be both tolerant and
merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet
they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic
succession of Narada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(18.68-69):
ya idam paramam guhyam
mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati
bhaktim mayi param krtva
mam evaisyaty asamsayah
na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah
bhavita na ca me tasmad
anyah priyataro bhuvi
"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the
end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there
ever be one more dear." Let us continue preaching the message of Lord Krsna and not be afraid of
enemies. Our only duty is to satisfy the Lord by this preaching, which will be accepted as service by Lord
Caitanya and Lord Krsna. We must sincerely serve the Lord and not be deterred by so-called enemies.
In this verse the word sauhrda-ghnam ("a breaker of friendship") is used. Because Narada Muni and the
members of his disciplic succession disrupt friendships and family life, they are sometimes accused of
being sauhrda-ghnam, creators of enmity between relatives. Actually such devotees are friends of every
living entity (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam), but they are misunderstood to be enemies. Preaching can be a
difficult, thankless task, but a preacher must follow the orders of the Supreme Lord and be unafraid of
materialistic persons.

Prajapati Daksa continued: If you think that simply awakening the sense of renunciation will detach one
from the material world, I must say that unless full knowledge is awakened, simply changing dresses as
you have done cannot possibly bring detachment.
Prajapati Daksa was correct in stating that changing one's dress cannot detach one from this material
world. The sannyasis of Kali-yuga who change their robes from white to saffron and then think they can
do whatever they like are more abominable than materialistic grhasthas. This is not recommended
anywhere. Prajapati Daksa was right in pointing out this defect, but he did not know that Narada Muni
had aroused the spirit of renunciation in the Haryasvas and Savalasvas through full knowledge. Such
enlightened renunciation is desirable. One should enter the renounced order with full knowledge (jnanavairagya),
for the perfection of life is possible for one who renounces this material world in that way. This
elevated stage can be reached very easily, as supported by the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires
causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." If one seriously engages in devotional service to
Lord Vasudeva, jnana and vairagya are automatically manifest in one's person. There is no doubt of this.
Prajapati Daksa's accusation that Narada had not actually elevated his sons to the platform of knowledge
was not factual. All the sons of Prajapati Daksa had first been raised to the platform of jnana and had then
automatically renounced this world. In summary, unless one's knowledge is awakened, renunciation
cannot take place, for without elevated knowledge one cannot give up attachment for material enjoyment.

Material enjoyment is indeed the cause of all unhappiness, but one cannot give it up unless one has
personally experienced how much suffering it is. Therefore one should be allowed to remain in so-called
material enjoyment while simultaneously advancing in knowledge to experience the misery of this false
material happiness. Then, without help from others, one will find material enjoyment detestful. Those
whose minds are changed by others do not become as renounced as those who have personal experience.
It is said that unless a woman becomes pregnant, she cannot understand the trouble of giving birth to a
child. Bandhya ki bujhibe prasava-vedana. The word bandhya means a sterile woman. Such a woman
cannot give birth to a child. How, then, can she perceive the pain of delivery? According to the
philosophy of Prajapati Daksa, a woman should first become pregnant and then experience the pain of
childbirth. Then, if she is intelligent, she will not want to be pregnant again. Actually. however. this is not
a fact. Sex enjoyment is so strong that a woman becomes pregnant and suffers at the time of childbirth.
but she becomes pregnant again, despite her experience. According to Daksa's philosophy. one should
become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment. one
will automatically renounce. Material nature, however. is so strong that although a man suffers at every
step, he will not cease his attempts to enjoy (trpyanti neha krpana-bahu-duhkha-bhajah). Under the
circumstances, unless one gets the association of a devotee like Narada Muni or his servant in the disciplic
succession, one's dormant spirit of renunciation cannot be awakened. It is not a fact that because material
enjoyment involves so many painful conditions one will automatically become detached. One needs the
blessings of a devotee like Narada Muni. Then one can renounce his attachment for the material world.
The young boys and girls of the Krsna consciousness movement have given up the spirit of material
enjoyment not because of practice but by the mercy of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His servants.

I am known as a grhavrata. Unfortunately, you have given me great displeasure by misguiding my sons,

Prajapati Daksa wanted to prove that he had been most tolerant in not having said anything when
Narada Muni, for no reason, induced his ten thousand innocent sons to adopt the path of renunciation.
Sometimes householders are accused of being grhamedhis, for grhamedhis are satisfied with family life
without spiritual advancement. Grhasthas, however, are different because although grhasthas live in
householder life with their wives and children, they are eager for spiritual advancement. Wanting to prove
that he had been magnanimous to Narada Muni, Prajapati Daksa stressed that when Narada had misled
his first sons, Daksa had taken no action; he had been kind and tolerant. He was aggrieved, however,
because Narada Muni had misled his sons for a second time. Therefore he wanted to prove that Narada
Muni, although dressed like a sadhu, was not actually a sadhu; he himself, although a householder, was a
greater sadhu than Narada Muni.

Therefore you are a rascal who does not know how to behave toward others. You may travel all over the

Because Prajapati Daksa was a grhamedhi who wanted to remain in household life, he thought that if
Narada Muni could not remain in one place, but had to travel all over the world, that would be a great
punishment for him. Actually, however, such a punishment is a boon for a preacher. A preacher is known
as parivrajakacarya--an acarya, or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society. Prajapati
Daksa cursed Narada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he
would never be able to stay in one place. In the parampara system from Narada Muni, I have also been
cursed. Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere,
for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples. Since the Krsna consciousness movement
was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided
comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week. I do
not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish
another task--this translation of Srimad-Bhagavatam. If my young disciples, especially those who have
taken sannyasa, take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse
of the parents to these young preachers. Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of
translation.

sri-suka uvaca
pratijagraha tad badham
naradah sadhu-sammatah
etavan sadhu-vado hi
titiksetesvarah svayam
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; pratijagraha--accepted; tat--that; badham--so be it;
naradah--Narada Muni; sadhu-sammatah--who is an approved sadhu; etavan--this much; sadhu-vadah--
appropriate for a saintly person; hi--indeed; titikseta--he may tolerate; isvarah--although able to curse
Prajapati Daksa; svayam--himself.
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, since Narada Muni is an approved saintly person, when
cursed by Prajapati Daksa he replied, "tad badham: Yes, what you have said is good. I accept this curse."
He could have cursed Prajapati Daksa in return, but because he is a tolerant and merciful sadhu, he took
no action.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.21):
titiksavah karunikah
suhrdah sarva-dehinam
ajata-satravah santah
sadhavah sadhu-bhusanah
"The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no
enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime." Because
Narada Muni is the most elevated of sadhus, devotees, to deliver Prajapati Daksa he silently tolerated the
curse. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has taught this principle to all His devotees:
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the
straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should
be ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord
constantly." Following the orders of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord
all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree
because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not
only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when
Nityananda Prabhu went to preach Krsna consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jagai and Madhai,
they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who
became perfect Vaisnavas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion.
Therefore the curse against Narada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it.
Now, it may be asked why Narada Muni stayed in the presence of Prajapati Daksa and tolerated all his
accusations and curses. Was that for Daksa's deliverance? The answer is yes. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that after being insulted by Prajapati Daksa, Narada Muni should have left immediately, but
he purposely stayed to hear all Daksa's strong words so that Daksa might be relieved of his anger.
Prajapati Daksa was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities.
Therefore Narada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Daksa, satisfied and freed from anger,
would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vaisnava and be delivered. When Jagai
and Madhai offended Lord Nityananda, Lord Nityananda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell
at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vaisnavas.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
entitled "Narada Muni Cursed by Prajapati Daksa."
Chapter Six
The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksa
As described in this chapter, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.
These daughters were given in charity to various persons to increase the population. Since these offspring
of Daksa were women, Narada Muni did not try to lead them toward the renounced order of life. Thus the
daughters were saved from Narada Muni. Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to Dharmaraja,
thirteen to Kasyapa Muni, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, Candra. In this way fifty daughters were
distributed, and of the other ten daughters, four were given to Kasyapa and two each to Bhuta, Angira and
Krsasva. One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted
personalities that the entire universe was filled with various kinds of living entities, such as human
beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.

his wife named Asikni; anunitah--pacified; svayambhuva--by Lord Brahma; sastim--sixty; sanjanayam
asa--begot; duhitrh--daughters; pitr-vatsalah--all very affectionate to their father.
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, thereafter, at the request of Lord Brahma, Prajapati Daksa,
who is known as Pracetasa, begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni. All the daughters were
very affectionate toward their father.
After the incidents concerning the loss of his many sons, Daksa repented his misunderstanding with
Narada Muni. Lord Brahma then saw Daksa and instructed him to beget children again. This time Daksa
was very cautious to beget female children instead of male children so that Narada Muni would not
disturb them by urging them to accept the renounced order. Females are not meant for the renounced
order of life; they should be faithful to their good husbands, for if a husband is competent for liberation,
his wife will also achieve liberation with him. As stated in the sastra, the results of a husband's pious
activities are shared by his wife. Therefore a woman's duty is to be very chaste and faithful to her
husband. Then without separate endeavor she will share in all the profit the husband earns.

Brahma, Prajapati Kasyapa married Puloma and Kalaka, the other two daughters of Vaisvanara. From the
wombs of these two wives of Kasyapa came sixty thousand sons, headed by Nivatakavaca, who are known
as the Paulomas and the Kalakeyas. They were physically very strong and expert in fighting, and their aim
was to disturb the sacrifices performed by the great sages. My dear King, when your grandfather Arjuna
went to the heavenly planets, he alone killed all these demons, and thus King Indra became extremely
affectionate toward him.

Although Visvarupa was the son of the daughter of their eternal enemies the demons, the demigods
accepted him as their priest in accordance with the order of Brahma when they were abandoned by their
spiritual master, Brhaspati, whom they had disrespected.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sixth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksa."
Chapter Seven
Indra Offends His Spiritual Master, Brhaspati.
As related in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual
master, Brhaspati. Brhaspati therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request
of the demigods, Visvarupa, the son of the brahmana Tvasta, became their priest.
Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife Sacidevi and being praised
by various demigods like the Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the
demigods, entered the assembly. Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did
not respect Brhaspati, who thus became aware of Indra's pride in his material opulence and immediately
disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most repentant, understanding that
because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon
from his spiritual master, but could not find Brhaspati anywhere.
Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master. Indra lost all his opulence and was
conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra's throne. King
Indra, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahma. Understanding the situation,
Lord Brahma chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahma's
orders, the demigods accepted Visvarupa, who was a brahmana and the son of Tvasta, as their priest.
Then they performed yajnas under the priesthood of Visvarupa and were able to conquer the demons.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King, once upon a time, the King of heaven, Indra, being extremely proud
because of his great opulence of the three worlds, transgressed the law of Vedic etiquette. Seated on his
throne, he was surrounded by the Maruts, Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Rbhus, Visvadevas, Sadhyas, Asvinikumaras,
Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas and by great saintly persons. Also surrounding him were the
Vidyadharas, Apsaras, Kinnaras, Patagas [birds] and Uragas [snakes]. All of them were offering Indra their
respects and services, and the Apsaras and Gandharvas were dancing and singing with very sweet musical
instruments. Over Indra's head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon. Fanned by yak-tail
whisks and served with all the paraphernalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, Sacidevi, who
occupied half the throne, when the great sage Brhaspati appeared in that assembly. Brhaspati, the best of
the sages, was the spiritual master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the demigods and
demons alike. Nevertheless, although Indra saw his spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his
own seat or offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a respectful welcome. Indra did
nothing to show him respect.

Although I am King of the demigods, who are situated in the mode of goodness, I was proud of a little
opulence and polluted by false ego. Under the circumstances, who in this world would accept such riches
at the risk of falling down ? Alas! I condemn my wealth and opulence.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu prayed to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, na dhanam na janam na
sundarim kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye: "O my Lord, I do not aspire for material opulence or wealth, nor
do I want a great number of followers to accept me as their leader, nor do I want a very beautiful wife to
please me." Mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: "I do not even want liberation.
All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship." According to the laws of nature,
when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively.
The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an
exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We
are now actually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to advance in material
opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting
the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and
unmanageable. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.31), na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: persons
who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore,
both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted
to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the
unwanted population known as varna-sankara, and as stated in Bhagavad-gita, an increase of varnasankara
population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves.
Fortunately, however, the Hare Krsna movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men
are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men
who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. If the American people
are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Krsna
consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in Bhagavad-gita (caturvarnyam
maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). They must divide their society into first-class men,
second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are
less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra
regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, Brhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people
regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the
representative of Krsna. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the
entire world.

If a person says, "One who is situated on the exalted throne of a king should not stand up to show
respect to another king or a brahmana," it is to be understood that he does not know the superior
religious principles.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this regard that when a president or king is sitting on his
throne, he does not need to show respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show
respect to superiors like his spiritual master, brahmanas and Vaisnavas. There are many examples of how
he should act. When Lord Krsna was sitting on His throne and Narada fortunately entered His assembly,
even Lord Krsna immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to
Narada. Narada knew that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Krsna knew that Narada was
His devotee, but although Krsna is the Supreme Lord and Narada is the Lord's devotee, the Lord observed
the religious etiquette. Since Narada was a brahmacari, a brahmana and an exalted devotee, even Krsna,
while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto Narada. Such is the conduct visible in the
Vedic civilization. A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of Narada and
Krsna should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in Krsna
consciousness--a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year
and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones--may be technologically advanced, but it is not a
human civilization. A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the catur-varnya system, the
system of four orders of life. There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to
act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey
the three higher classes of society. One who does not follow the standard system of society should be
considered a fifth-class man. A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to
humanity. As stated in this verse, dharmam te na param viduh: such a society does not know the aim of
life and the highest principle of religion.

Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of
destruction [as described in the previous verse] are, in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those
who blindly follow them. A stone boat would be unable to float and would sink in the water with its
passengers. Similarly, those who mislead people go to hell, and their followers go with them.
As stated in the Vedic literature (Bhag. 11.20.17):
nr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham
plavam sukalpam guru-karna-dharam
We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the human body fortunately
provides us a good opportunity to cross the ocean because the human body is like a very good boat. When
directed by a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the ocean. Furthermore,
the boat is helped across by favorable winds, which are the instructions of Vedic knowledge. If one does
not take advantage of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience, he is certainly committing suicide.
One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed. To be elevated to the stage of perfection, humanity
must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone. All of human society is in such a dangerous
position that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the Vedas. The cream of these
instructions appears in the form of Bhagavad-gita. One should not take shelter of any other instructions,
for Bhagavad-gita gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of human life. Lord Sri Krsna
therefore says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other processes of
religion and simply surrender to Me." Even if one does not accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and beneficial for humanity that if one follows His
instructions one will be saved. Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and gymnastic
methods of yoga. Thus one will board a boat of stone. which will sink and drown all its passengers.
Unfortunately. although the American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos, they
are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats. That will not help them. They must take the
proper boat offered by Krsna in the form of the Krsna consciousness movement. Then they will be easily
saved. In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments: asmamayah plavo yesam te yatha
majjantam plavam anumajjanti tatheti raja-nity-upadestrsu sva-sabhyesu kopo vyanjitah. If society is
guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against another, it will certainly sink like a
stone boat. political maneuvering and diplomacy will not save human society. People must take to Krsna
consciousness to understand the aim of life, to understand God. and to fulfill the human mission.

athaham amaracaryam

atha--therefore; aham--I; amara-acaryam--the spiritual master of the demigods; agadha-dhisanam--
whose spiritual knowledge is deep; dvijam--the perfect brahmana; prasadayisye--I shall please; nisathah--
without duplicity; sirsna--with my head; tat-caranam--his lotus feet; sprsan--touching.
King Indra said: Therefore with great frankness and without duplicity I shall now bow my head at the
lotus feet of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. Because he is in the mode of goodness, he is
fully aware of all knowledge and is the best of the brahmanas. Now I shall touch his lotus feet and offer
my obeisances unto him to try to satisfy him.
Coming to his senses, King Indra realized that he was not a very sincere disciple of his spiritual master,
Brhaspati. Therefore he decided that henceforward he would be nisatha, nonduplicitous. Nisathah sirsnatac-
caranam sprsan: he decided to touch his head to the feet of his spiritual master. From this example,
we should learn this principle enunciated by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura:
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto 'pi
"By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of Krsna. Without the grace of the
spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement." A disciple should never be a hypocrite or be
unfaithful to his spiritual master. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.17.27), the spiritual master is also called
acarya. Acaryam mam vijaniyan: the Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one should respect the
spiritual master, accepting him as the Lord Himself. Navamanyeta karhicit: one should not disrespect the
acarya at any time. Na martya-buddhyasuyeta: one should never think the acarya an ordinary person.
Familiarity sometimes breeds contempt, but one should be very careful in one's dealings with the acarya.
Agadha-dhisanam dvijam: the acarya is a perfect brahmana and has unlimited intelligence in guiding the
activities of his disciple. Therefore Krsna advises in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
One should fully surrender unto the spiritual master. and with service (sevaya) one should approach him
for further spiritual enlightenment.

demigods; hi--indeed; abhadram--injustice; vah--by you; krtam--done; mahat--great; brahmistham--a
person fully obedient to the Supreme Brahman; brahmanam--a brahmana; dantam--who has fully
controlled the mind and senses; aisvaryat--because of your material opulence; na--not; abhyanandata--
welcomed properly.
Lord Brahma said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your
material opulence, you failed to receive Brhaspati properly when he came to your assembly. Because he is
aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the brahmanas.
Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.
Lord Brahma recognized the brahminical qualifications of Brhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the
demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman. Brhaspati was very much in control of his
senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified brahmana. Lord Brahma chastised the demigods
for not properly respecting this brahmana, who was their guru. Lord Brahma wanted to impress upon the
demigods that one's guru should not be disrespected under any circumstances. When Brhaspati entered
the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted. Since he came every day,
they thought, they did not need to show him special respect. As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt.
Being very much displeased, Brhaspati immediately left Indra's palace. Thus all the demigods, headed by
Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of Brhaspati, and Lord Brahma, being aware of this, condemned
their neglect. In a song we sing every day, Narottama dasa Thakura says, caksu-dana dila yei, janme janme
prabhu sei: the guru gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the guru should be considered his
master, life after life. Under no circumstances should the guru be disrespected, but the demigods, being
puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their guru. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.17.27) advises, acaryam mam vijaniyan navamanyeta karhicit. na martya-buddhyasuyeta: the acarya
should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the acarya, considering him an
ordinary human being.

Because of your misbehavior toward Brhaspati, you have been defeated by the demons. My dear

who were so advanced in opulence, be defeated by them?
The devas are celebrated for fighting with the asuras perpetually. In such fights the asuras were always
defeated, but this time the demigods were defeated. Why? The reason, as stated here, was that they had
offended their spiritual master. Their impudent disrespect of their spiritual master was the cause of their
defeat by the demons. As stated in the sastras, when one disrespects a respectable superior, one loses his
longevity and the results of his pious activities, and in this way one is degraded.

O Indra, your enemies, the demons, were extremely weak because of their disrespect toward Sukracarya,
but since they have now worshiped Sukracarya with great devotion, they have again become powerful. By
their devotion to Sukracarya, they have increased their strength so much that now they are even able to
easily seize my abode from me.
Lord Brahma wanted to point out to the demigods that by the strength of the guru one can become most
powerful within this world, and by the displeasure of the guru one can lose everything. This is confirmed
by the song of Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura:
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto 'pi
"By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of Krsna. Without the grace of the
spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement." Although the demons are insignificant in
comparison to Lord Brahma, because of the strength of their guru they were so powerful that they could
even seize Brahmaloka from Lord Brahma. We therefore pray to the spiritual master:
mukam karoti vacalam
pangum langhayate girim
yat-krpa tam aham vande
sri-gurum dina-taranam
By the mercy of the guru, even a dumb man can become the greatest orator, and even a lame man can
cross mountains. As advised by Lord Brahma, one should remember this sastric injunction if one desires
success in his life.

Because of their firm determination to follow the instructions of Sukracarya, his disciples, the demons,
are now unconcerned about the demigods. In fact, kings or others who have determined faith in the
mercy of brahmanas, cows and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and who always worship
these three are always strong in their position.
From the instructions of Lord Brahma it is understood that everyone should very faithfully worship the
brahmanas, the Supreme personality of Godhead and the cows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
go-brahmana-hitaya ca: He is always very kind to cows and brahmanas. Therefore one who worships
Govinda must satisfy Him by worshiping the brahmanas and cows. If a government worships the
brahmanas, the cows and Krsna, Govinda, it is never defeated anywhere; otherwise it must always be
defeated and condemned everywhere. At the present moment, all over the world, governments have no
respect for brahmanas, cows and Govinda, and consequently there are chaotic conditions all over the
world. In summary, although the demigods were very powerful in material opulence, the demons defeated
them in battle because the demigods had behaved disrespectfully toward a brahmana, Brhaspati, who was
their spiritual master.

The acarya, the spiritual master who teaches all the Vedic knowledge and gives initiation by offering the
sacred thread, is the personification of all the Vedas. Similarly, a father personifies Lord Brahma; a
brother, King Indra; a mother, the planet earth; and a sister, mercy. A guest personifies religious
principles, an invited guest personifies the demigod Agni, and all living entities personify Lord Visnu, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
According to the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should observe all
living entities to be on the same level as oneself. This means that no one should be neglected as inferior;
because Paramatma is seated in everyone's body, everyone should be respected as a temple of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This verse describes the different ways in which one should respect a guru, a
father, a brother, a sister, a guest and so on.

Since you are completely aware of the Supreme Brahman, you are a perfect brahmana, and therefore you
are the spiritual master of all orders of life. We accept you as our spiritual master and director so that by
the power of your austerity we may easily defeat the enemies who have conquered us.
One must approach a particular type of guru to execute a particular type of duty. Therefore although
Visvarupa was inferior to the demigods, the demigods accepted him as their guru to conquer the demons.

The demigods continued: Do not fear criticism for being younger than us. Such etiquette does not apply
in regard to Vedic mantras. Except in relationship to Vedic mantras, seniority is determined by age, but
one may offer respectful obeisances even to a younger person who is advanced in chanting Vedic mantras.
Therefore although you are junior in relationship to us, you may become our priest without hesitation.
It is said, vrddhatvam vayasa vina: one may be senior without being advanced in age. Even if one is not
old, one gains seniority if he is senior in knowledge. Visvarupa was junior in relationship to the demigods
because he was their nephew, but the demigods wanted to accept him as their priest, and therefore he
would have to accept obeisances from them. The demigods explained that this should not be a cause for
hesitation; he could become their priest because he was advanced in Vedic knowledge. Similarly. Canakya
Pandita advises, nicad apy uttamam jnanam: one may accept education from a member of a lower social
order. The brahmanas, the members of the most elevated varna, are teachers, but a person in a lower
family, such as a family of ksatriyas, vaisyas or even sudras, may be accepted as a teacher if he has
knowledge. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu approved of this when He expressed this opinion before Ramananda
Raya (Cc. Madhya 8.128):
kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya
yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei 'guru' haya
It does not matter whether one is a brahmana, sudra, grhastha or sannyasi. These are all material
designations. A spiritually advanced person has nothing to do with such designations. Therefore, if one is
advanced in the science of Krsna consciousness, regardless of his position in human society, he may
become a spiritual master.

previously acquired brahminical power, how can someone like me refuse to accept your personal request?
You are all exalted commanders of the entire universe. I am your disciple and must take many lessons
from you. Therefore I cannot refuse you. I must agree for my own benefit.
The professions of a qualified brahmana are pathana, pathana, yajana, yajana, dana and pratigraha. The
words yajana and yajana mean that a brahmana becomes the priest of the populace for the sake of their
elevation. One who accepts the post of spiritual master neutralizes the sinful reactions of the yajamana,
the one on whose behalf he performs yajna. Thus the results of the pious acts previously performed by the
priest or spiritual master are diminished. Therefore priesthood is not accepted by learned brahmanas.
Nevertheless, the greatly learned brahmana Visvarupa became the priest of the demigods because of his
profound respect for them.

O exalted governors of various planets, the true brahmana, who has no material possessions, maintains
himself by the profession of accepting silonchana. In other words, he picks up grains left in the field and
on the ground in the wholesale marketplace. By this means, householder brahmanas who actually abide
by the principles of austerity and penance maintain themselves and their families and perform all
necessary pious activities. A brahmana who desires to achieve happiness by gaining wealth through
professional priesthood must certainly have a very low mind. How shall I accept such priesthood?
A first-class brahmana does not accept any rewards from his disciples or yajamanas. Practicing
austerities and penances, he instead goes to the agricultural field and collects food grains left by the
agriculturalists to be collected by brahmanas. Similarly, such brahmanas go to marketplaces where grains
are purchased and sold wholesale, and there they collect grains left by the merchants. In this way, such
exalted brahmanas maintain their bodies and families. Such priests never demand anything from their
disciples to live in opulence, imitating ksatriyas or vaisyas. In other words, a pure brahmana voluntarily
accepts a life of poverty and lives in complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord. Not very many years
ago, a brahmana in Krsnanagara, near Navadvipa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, Vraja
Krsnacandra. The brahmana refused to accept the help. He said that since he was very happy in his
householder life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind leaves, there was
no question of taking help from the Zamindar. The conclusion is that although a brahmana may receive
much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal
benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: O King, after making this promise to the demigods, the exalted
Visvarupa, surrounded by the demigods, performed the necessary priestly activities with great enthusiasm
and attention.
The word samadhina is very important. Samadhi means complete absorption with an undiverted mind.
Visvarupa, who was a most learned brahmana, not only accepted the request of the demigods, but took
their request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an undiverted mind. In other
words, he accepted the priesthood not for material gain, but to profit the demigods. Such is the duty of a
priest. The word purah means "family," and hita means "benefit." Thus the word purohita indicates that
the priest is the well-wisher of the family. Another meaning of the word purah is "first." A priest's first
duty is to see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means. Then he is satisfied. A priest
should never be interested in performing Vedic rituals for his personal benefit.

unto King Indra; vaisnavya--of Lord Visnu; vidyaya--by a prayer; vibhuh--the most powerful Visvarupa.
The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the enemies of the demigods, was protected
by the talents and tactics of Sukracarya, but Visvarupa, who was most powerful, composed a protective
prayer known as the Narayana-kavaca. By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the
demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.
The distinction between the demigods (devas) and demons (asuras) is that the demigods are all devotees
of Lord Visnu whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord Siva, Goddess Kali and Goddess
Durga. Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahma. For example, Hiranyakasipu was a
devotee of Lord Brahma, Ravana was a devotee of Lord Siva, and Mahisasura was a devotee of Goddess
Durga. The demigods are devotees of Lord Visnu (visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva), whereas the demons
(asuras tad-viparyayah) are always against the visnu-bhaktas, or Vaisnavas. To oppose the Vaisnavas, the
demons become devotees of Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, Kali, Durga, and so on. In the days of yore, many
long years ago, there was animosity between the devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues,
for the devotees of Lord Siva and Goddess Durga are always envious of Vaisnavas, who are devotees of
Lord Visnu. This strain between the devotees of Lord Siva and Lord Visnu has always existed. In the
higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time.
Herein we see that Visvarupa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Visnu
mantra. Sometimes the Visnu mantra is called Visnu-jvara, and the Siva mantra is called Siva-jvara. We
find in the sastras that sometimes the Siva-jvara and Visnu-jvara are employed in the fights between the
demons and the demigods.
The word sura-dvisam, which in this verse means "of the enemies of the demigods," also refers to the
atheists. Srimad-Bhagavatam elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering
the demons or atheists. The Supreme Personality of Godhead always awards His benediction to devotees.
The Lord Himself confirms this in Bhagavad-gita (9.31):
kaunteya pratijanihi
na me bhaktah pranasyati
"O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes."

entitled "Indra Offends His Spiritual Master, Brhaspati."
Chapter Eight
The Narayana-kavaca Shield
This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious over the soldiers of the demons,
and it also describes the shield of the Visnu mantra.
To take protection from this shield, one must first touch kusa grass and wash one's mouth with
acamana-mantras. One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Visnu mantra on the parts
of his body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands. The eight-syllable mantra is om namo
narayanaya. This mantra should be distributed all over the front and back of the body. The twelve-syllable
mantra, which begins with the pranava, omkara, is om namo bhagavate vasudevaya. One syllable should
be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the pranava, omkara. Thereafter, one must
chant om visnave namah, which is a six-syllable mantra. One must progressively place the syllables of the
mantra on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the sikha and between the eyes, and then
one should chant mah astraya phat and with this mantra protect himself from all directions. Nadevo
devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the level of a deva cannot chant this mantra. According to this
direction of the sastra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme.
After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-armed Lord Visnu, who sits on the
shoulders of Garudadeva. One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vamana, Kurma, Nrsimha,
Varaha. Parasurama, Ramacandra (the elder brother of Laksmana). Nara-Narayana, Dattatreya (an
empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumara, Hayagriva, Naradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee).
Dhanvantari, Rsabhadeva, Yajna, Balarama, Vyasadeva, Buddhadeva and Kesava. One should also think of
Govinda, the master of Vrndavana. and one should think of Narayana, the master of the spiritual sky. One
should think of Madhusudana, Tridhama, Madhava, Hrsikesa, Padmanabha, Janardana, Damodara and
Visvesvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself. After offering prayers to the
Lord's personal expansions known as the svamsa and saktyavesa-avataras, one should pray to the weapons
of Lord Narayana, such as the Sudarsana, gada, sankha, khadga and bow.
After explaining this process, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit how Visvarupa, the brother of
Vrtrasura, described the glories of the Narayana-kavaca to Indra.

and sit gravely and silently, facing north. When completely purified, one should touch the mantra
composed of eight syllables to the eight parts of his body and touch the mantra composed of twelve

armor. First, while chanting the mantra composed of eight syllables [om namo narayanaya], beginning
with the pranava, the syllable om, one should touch his hands to eight parts of his body, starting with the
two feet and progressing systematically to the knees, thighs, abdomen, heart, chest, mouth and head.
Then one should chant the mantra in reverse, beginning from the last syllable [ya], while touching the
parts of his body in the reverse order. These two processes are known as utpatti-nyasa and samhara-nyasa
respectively.

May the Lord, who assumes the body of a great fish, protect me in the water from the fierce animals that
are associates of the demigod Varuna. By expanding His illusory energy, the Lord assumed the form of the
dwarf Vamana. May Vamana protect me on the land. Since the gigantic form of the Lord, Visvarupa,

Lusty desires are very strong in everyone, and they are the greatest impediment to the discharge of
devotional service. Therefore those who are very much influenced by lusty desires are advised to take
shelter of Sanat-kumara, the great brahmacari devotee. Narada Muni, who is the guide for arcana, is the
author of the Narada-pancaratra, which prescribes the regulative principles for worshiping the Deity.
Everyone engaged in Deity worship, whether at home or in the temple, should always seek the mercy of
Devarsi Narada in order to avoid the thirty-two offenses while worshiping the Deity. These offenses in
Deity worship are mentioned in The Nectar of Devotion.

To live within this material world, one must face many dangers, as described herein. For example,
undesirable food poses a danger to health, and therefore one must give up such food. The Dhanvantari
incarnation can protect us in this regard. Since Lord Visnu is the Supersoul of all living entities, if He likes
He can save us from adhibhautika disturbances, disturbances from other living entities. Lord Balarama is
the Sesa incarnation, and therefore He can save us from angry serpents or envious persons, who are
always ready to attack.

dvaipayano bhagavan aprabodhad
buddhas tu pasanda-gana-pramadat
kalkih kaleh kala-malat prapatu
dharmavanayoru-krtavatarah
dvaipayanah--Srila Vyasadeva, the giver of all Vedic knowledge; bhagavan--the most powerful
incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; aprabodhat--from ignorance of the sastra; buddhah
tu--also Lord Buddha; pasanda-gana--of atheists creating disillusionment for innocent persons; pramadat--
from the madness; kalkih--Lord Kalki, the incarnation of Kesava; kaleh--of this Kali-yuga; kala-malat--
from the darkness of the age; prapatu--may He protect; dharma-avanaya--for the protection of religious
principles; uru--very great; krta-avatarah--who took an incarnation.
May the Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Vyasadeva protect me from all kinds of ignorance
resulting from the absence of Vedic knowledge. May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed
to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge
and ritualistic action. May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an
incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.
This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for
various purposes. Srila Vyasadeva, Mahamuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human
society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may
consult the books left by Srila Vyasadeva, Upanisads, Vedanta-sutra (Brahma-sutra), Mahabharata,
Srimad-Bhagavatam Maha-purana (Vyasadeva's commentary on the Brahma-sutra) and the other
seventeen Puranas. Only by the mercy of Srila Vyasadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental
knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.
As described by Srila Jayadeva Gosvami in his Dasavatara-stotra, Lord Buddha apparently decried the
Vedic knowledge:
nindasi yajna-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam
sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-pasu-ghatam
kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare
The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to
save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed. When pasandis were cheating by killing animals on
the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic yajnas, the Lord said, "If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I
do not accept the Vedic principles." Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic
principles. One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the
injunctions of the Vedas.
The Kalki avatara is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this age of
Kali. Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga
advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real
religious principles enunciated by Lord Krsna before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not
surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion
are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on the
plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, yata mata
tata patha. According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human
society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious
principles mentioned in the Vedas, and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kaliyuga
progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Kesava, will descend to
kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.

According to Vedic astronomical calculations, day and night are each divided into thirty ghatikas
(twenty-four minutes), instead of twelve hours. Generally, each day and each night is divided into six
parts consisting of five ghatikas. In each of these six portions of the day and night, the Lord may be
addressed for protection according to different names. Lord Kesava, the proprietor of the holy place of
Mathura, is the Lord of the first portion of the day, and Govinda, the Lord of Vrndavana. is the master of
the second portion.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the material energy, the spiritual energy and
the entire creation are all individual substances. In the ultimate analysis, however, together they
constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual
knowledge see unity in diversity. For such advanced persons, the Lord's bodily decorations, His name, His
fame, His attributes and forms and the weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His
potency. According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the omniscient Lord, who manifests various
forms, is present everywhere. May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.
A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4) where Lord Krsna says, maya tatam idam
sarvam, indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy. This is confirmed in the Visnu
Purana (1.22.52):
ekadesa-sthitasyagner
jyotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah saktis
tathedam akhilam jagat
As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent
Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself
everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies. Since both cause and effect
are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and
weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him. There is no
difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies. This is also confirmed in the Padma
Purana:
nama cintamanih krsnas
caitanya-rasa-vigrahah
purnah suddho nitya-mukto
'bhinnatvan nama-naminoh
The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially. The word purna means
"complete." The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities,
paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material
contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as
the Lord. Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him. Therefore
even worship of the Lord's weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord.
Mayavadis refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is maya, or false,
but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although the Lord's original form and His
impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this
prayer says, patu sarvaih svarupair nah sada sarvatra sama-gah: "May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His
various forms, protect us everywhere." The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form,
qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees. Srila
Madhvacarya explains this as follows:
eka eva paro visnur
bhusaheti dhvajesv ajah
tat-tac-chakti-pradatvena
svayam eva vyavasthitah
satyenanena mam devah
patu sarvesvaro harih

King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Visvarupa.

This mystical mantric armor given by Visvarupa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the
effect that Indra was able to conquer the asuras and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without
impediments. In this regard, Madhvacarya points out:
vidyah karmani ca sada
guroh praptah phala-pradah
anyatha naiva phaladah
prasannoktah phala-pradah
One must receive all kinds of mantras from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the mantras will not
be fruitful. This is also indicated in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
All mantras should be received through the authorized guru, and the disciple must satisfy the guru in all
respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet. In the Padma Purana it is also said, sampradaya-vihina ye
mantras te nisphala matah. There are four sampradayas, or disciplic successions, namely the Brahmasampradaya,
the Rudra-sampradaya, the Sri sampradaya and the Kumara-sampradaya. If one wants to
advance in spiritual power, one must receive his mantras from one of these bona fide sampradayas;
otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Narayana-kavaca Shield."
Chapter Nine
Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, killed Visvarupa, and therefore Visvarupa's
father performed a yajna to kill Indra. When Vrtrasura appeared from that yajna, the demigods, in fear,
sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.
Because of affection for the demons, Visvarupa secretly supplied them the remnants of yajna. When
Indra learned about this, he beheaded Visvarupa, but he later regretted killing Visvarupa because
Visvarupa was a brahmana. Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana,
Indra did not do so. Instead he accepted the reactions. Later, he distributed these reactions among the
land, water, trees and women in general. Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, a
portion of the land turned into desert. The trees were also given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and
therefore they drip sap, which is prohibited for drinking. Because women accepted one fourth of the
sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period. Since water was also infested with
sinful reactions, when bubbles appear in water it cannot be used for any purpose.
After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed a sacrifice to kill King Indra. Unfortunately, if
mantras are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result. This happened when Tvasta performed this
yajna. While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra. Tvasta chanted a mantra to increase Indra's enemies,
but because he chanted the mantra wrong, the sacrifice produced an asura named Vrtrasura, of whom
Indra was the enemy. When Vrtrasura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole
world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other
means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of
all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped
Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger. Seeking shelter
of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross
the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the
ocean by grasping a dog's tail.
Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead advised them to approach
Dadhici to beg him for the bones of his own body. Dadhici would comply with the request of the
demigods, and with the help of his bones Vrtrasura could be killed.

King Pariksit, thus I have heard from authorities.
One cannot directly perceive the kingdom of heaven, its king and other inhabitants, or how they
perform their various engagements, for no one can go to the heavenly planets. Although modern scientists
have invented many powerful space vehicles, they cannot even go to the moon, not to speak of other
planets. By direct experience one cannot learn anything beyond the range of human perception. One must
hear from authorities. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, a great personality, says, "What I am describing to
you, O King, is what I have heard from authoritative sources." This is the Vedic system. The Vedic
knowledge is called sruti because it must be received by being heard from authorities. It is beyond the

Indra." In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (sasthi), and the word indra-satro is called
a tat-purusa compound (tatpurusa-samasa). Unfortunately, instead of chanting the mantra short, Tvasta
chanted it long, and its meaning changed from "the enemy of Indra" to "Indra, who is an enemy."
Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra's, there emerged the body of Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the
enemy.

appeared like a burnt hill and was as lustrous as a bright array of clouds in the evening. The hair on the
demon's body and his beard and moustache were the color of melted copper, and his eyes were piercing
like the midday sun. He appeared unconquerable, as if holding the three worlds on the points of his
blazing trident. Dancing and shouting with a loud voice, he made the entire surface of the earth tremble
as if from an earthquake. As he yawned again and again, he seemed to be trying to swallow the whole sky
with his mouth, which was as deep as a cave. He seemed to be licking up all the stars in the sky with his
tongue and eating the entire universe with his long, sharp teeth. Seeing this gigantic demon, everyone, in
great fear, ran here and there in all directions.

The demigods said: The three worlds are created by the five elements--namely ether, air, fire, water and
earth--which are controlled by various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahma. Being very much afraid
that the time factor will end our existence, we offer presentations unto time by performing our work as
time dictates. The time factor himself, however, is afraid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Therefore let us now worship that Supreme Lord, who alone can give us full protection.
When one is afraid of being killed, one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is
worshiped by all the demigods. beginning from Brahma, although they are in charge of the various
elements of this material world. The words bibheti yasmat indicate that all the demons, regardless of how
great and powerful, fear the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The demigods, being afraid of death, took
shelter of the Lord and offered Him these prayers. Although the time factor is fearful to everyone, fear
personified is afraid of the Supreme Lord, who is therefore known as abhaya, fearless. Taking shelter of
the Supreme Lord brings actual fearlessness, and therefore the demigods decided to take shelter of the
Lord.

Free from all material conceptions of existence and never wonder-struck by anything, the Lord is always
jubilant and fully satisfied by His own spiritual perfection. He has no material designations, and therefore
He is steady and unattached. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only shelter of everyone.
Anyone desiring to be protected by others is certainly a great fool who desires to cross the sea by holding
the tail of a dog.
A dog can swim in the water, but if a dog dives in the ocean and someone wants to cross the ocean by
holding the dog's tail, he is certainly fool number one. A dog cannot cross the ocean, nor can a person
cross the ocean by catching a dog's tail. Similarly, one who desires to cross the ocean of nescience should
not seek the shelter of any demigod or anyone else but the fearless shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.58) therefore says:
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso-murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
The Lord's lotus feet are an indestructible boat, and if one takes shelter of that boat he can easily cross
the ocean of nescience. Consequently there are no dangers for a devotee although he lives within this
material world, which is full of dangers at every step. One should seek the shelter of the all-powerful
instead of trying to be protected by one's own concocted ideas.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His external potency and by whose mercy we
expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His
form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods.
Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face
to face. Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Krsna or Lord Ramacandra and lives in human
society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him. Avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam: rascals (mudhas) deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an
ordinary human being. However insignificant we are, we think that we are also God, that we can create a
universe or that we can create another God. This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya says:
lingam eva pasyamah

We are all conditioned to various degrees, but we think that we are God. This is why we cannot

By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various
transcendental bodies as Vamanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Parasurama, the
incarnation among saints; Nrsimhadeva and Varaha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kurma,
incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities,
and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Krsna and Lord Rama. By His causeless mercy,
He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity
of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies.
Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [virat-rupa]. In our fearful
condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give
us His protection.
In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is ascertained to be the original cause of
creation. Sridhara Svami, in his commentary Bhavartha-dipika, replies to the idea that prakrti and purusa
are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, param pradhanam purusam visvam anyam:
"He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from
this universe, He exists in His universal form [virat 'rupa]." The word prakrti, which is used to indicate
the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word purusa refers to
the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the prakrti and purusa ultimately enter
the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (prakrtim yanti mamikam).
Although prakrti and purusa superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are
emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of prakrti
and purusa. He is the original cause (sarva-karana-karanam). The Naradiya Purana says:
avikaro 'pi paramah
prakrtis tu vikarini
anupravisya govindah
prakrtis cabhidhiyate
Both the prakrti and purusa, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (gam avisya), the Lord enters the prakrti, and then
the prakrti creates different manifestations. The prakrti is not independent or beyond His energies.
Vasudeva, Lord Sri Krsna, is the original cause of everything. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(10.8):
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who
perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts." In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (2.9.33) the Lord also says, aham evasam evagre: "Only I existed before the creation." This is
confirmed in the Brahmanda Purana as follows:
smrtir avyavadhanena
prakrtitvam iti sthitih
ubhayatmaka-sutitvad
vasudevah parah puman
prakrtih purusas ceti
sabdair eko 'bhidhiyate
To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the purusa and directly as the prakrti. Because both
energies emanate from Lord Vasudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is known as
both prakrti and purusa. Therefore Vasudeva is the cause of everything (sarva-karana-karanam).

with eyes like the petals of lotuses grown in autumn, they were overwhelmed with happiness and
immediately fell down like rods, offering dandavats. Then they slowly rose and pleased the Lord by
offering Him prayers.
In Vaikunthaloka the Supreme Personality of Godhead has four hands and decorations like the Srivatsa
mark on His chest and the gem known as Kaustubha. These are special indications of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The Lord's personal attendants and other devotees in Vaikuntha have the same
features, except for the Srivatsa mark and the Kaustubha gem.

An inexperienced man generally does not know what to beg from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Everyone is under the jurisdiction of the created material world, and no one knows what benediction to
ask when praying to the Supreme Lord. People generally pray to be promoted to the heavenly planets
because they have no information of Vaikunthaloka. Srila Madhvacarya quotes the following verse:
deva-lokat pitr-lokat
nirayac capi yat param
tisrbhyah paramam sthanam
vaisnavam vidusam gatih
There are different planetary systems, known as Devaloka (the planets of the demigods), Pitrloka (the
planet of the Pitas) and Niraya (the hellish planets). When one transcends these various planetary systems
and enters Vaikunthaloka, he achieves the ultimate resort of the Vaisnavas. Vaisnavas have nothing to do
with the other planetary systems.

of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal
form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Paramatma He is called antaryami, and
when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called Ksirodakasayi Visnu,
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Karanodakasayi Visnu. When He is realized as Vasudeva, Sankarsana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha--the Caturvyuha, who are beyond the three forms of Visnu--He is the
Vaikuntha Narayana. Above realization of Narayana is realization of Baladeva, and above that is
realization of Krsna. All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service. The
covered core of one's heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His various forms.

the pastimes of material creation, maintenance and annihilation; yat--which; asaranah--not dependent on
any other support; asarirah--without having a material body; idam--this; anaveksita--without waiting for;

such material qualities; srjasi--You create; pasi--maintain; harasi--annihilate.
O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation
from us. Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients
without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself.
Nevertheless, although You appear engaged in material activity, You are transcendental to all material
qualities. Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.
The Brahma-samhita (5.37) says, goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah: the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, is always situated in Goloka Vrndavana. It is also said, vrndavanam parityajya padam
ekam na gacchati: Krsna never goes even a step from Vrndavana. Nevertheless, although Krsna is situated
in His own abode, Goloka Vrndavana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present
everywhere. This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand. but devotees can understand how
Krsna, without undergoing any changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive. The
demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord's body, although the Supreme Lord has
no material body and does not need anyone's help. He is spread everywhere (maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina). Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form. According to
the Mayavada philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form.
The Mayavadis suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form. This is untrue. The
Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and
corner of the material creation.

atha--therefore; tatra--in that; bhavan--Your Lordship; kim--whether; deva-datta-vat--like an ordinary
human being, forced by the fruits of his activities; iha--in this material world; guna-visarga-patitah--fallen
in a material body impelled by the modes of material nature; paratantryena--by dependence on the

full spiritual potencies; udaste--remains neutral as the witness; iti--thus; ha vava--certainly; na vidamah--
we do not understand.
These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus
receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this
material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results
of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here
only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual
potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.
In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely
paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees.
These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the
demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them
relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls.
When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts
impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which
He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is apapa-viddham; He is never
contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When Krsna was present on this earth, He
killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received sarupya; in other words, they returned to their
original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord's position says that God is unkind to him but
merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu na me dvesyo
'sti na priyah: "I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend." But He also says,
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te tesu capy aham: "If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders
unto Me, I give him special attention."

O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are
the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited
glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong
without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments
inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because
their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the
truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their
theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one
without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress,
are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the
help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position,
You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (atmarama). He
enjoys bliss in two ways--when He appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and
contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence.
There is no limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from
the material world can exist in Him. He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of
material happiness and distress do not apply to Him.
We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually
there are no contradictions. That is the meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is
not subject to the conditioned soul's arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence. He is pleased to
protect His devotees by killing their enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.
Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees. In Vrndavana, the
damsels of Vrajabhumi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when Krsna and Balarama leave
Vrndavana for Mathura. There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be
distressed or happy. One who is atmarama is blissful in both ways.
Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees.
Therefore in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, bhaktya mam abhijanati: the transcendental pastimes can be
understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable. Acintyah khalu ye bhava
na tams tarkena yojayet: the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are
inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical
arguments. They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth.

sama-visama-matinam matam anusarasi yatha rajju-khandah sarpadi-dhiyam.
sama--equal or proper; visama--and unequal or mistaken; matinam--of those having intelligence;
matam--conclusion; anusarasi--You follow; yatha--just as; rajju-khandah--a piece of rope; sarpa-adi--a
snake, etc.; dhiyam--of those who perceive.
A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper
intelligence who knows it to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, inspire
fear or fearlessness according to one's intelligence, but in You there is no duality.
In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: "As one
surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly." The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of
everything, including all knowledge, all truth and all contradictions. The example cited herein is very
appropriate. A rope is one truth, but some mistake it for a snake, whereas others know it to be a rope.
Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not see contradictions in Him, but
nondevotees regard Him as the snakelike source of all fear. For example, when Nrsimhadeva appeared,
Prahlada Maharaja saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his father, a demon, saw Him as the
ultimate death. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.37), bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah syat: fear results
from being absorbed in duality. When one is in knowledge of duality, one knows both fear and bliss. The
same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of
knowledge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision. The
unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions.

sah--He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva--indeed; hi--certainly; punah--again; sarva-vastuni--
in everything, material and spiritual; vastu-svarupah--the substance; sarva-isvarah--the controller of
everything; sakala-jagat--of the whole universe; karana--of the causes; karana-bhutah--existing as the
cause; sarva-pratyak-atmatvat--because of being the Supersoul of every living being, or being present in

intelligence and the senses); abhasa--by the manifestations; upalaksitah--perceived; ekah--alone; eva--
indeed; paryavasesitah--left remaining.
With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although manifested in different ways, is actually
the basic principle of everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material manifestation, but
the material energy is caused by Him. Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of
intelligence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of everything. Without Him, everything
would be dead. You, as that Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.
The words sarva-vastuni vastu-svarupah indicate that the Supreme Lord is the active principle of
everything. As described in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):
eko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim
yac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who enters the existence of every universe and every
atom by one of His plenary portions and thus manifests His infinite energy throughout the material
creation." By His one plenary portion as Paramatma, antaryami, the Lord is all-pervading throughout the
unlimited universes. He is the pratyak, or antaryami, of all living entities. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(13.3), ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: "O scion of Bharata, you should understand
that I am also the knower in all bodies." Because the Lord is the Supersoul, He is the active principle of
every living entity and even the atom (anda-ntara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham). He is the actual
reality. According to various stages of intelligence, one realizes the presence of the Supreme in everything
through the manifestations of His energy. The entire world is permeated by the three gunas, and one can
understand His presence according to one's modes of material nature.

Therefore, O killer of the Madhu demon, incessant transcendental bliss flows in the minds of those who
have even once tasted but a drop of the nectar from the ocean of Your glories. Such exalted devotees
forget the tiny reflection of so-called material happiness produced from the material senses of sight and
sound. Free from all desires, such devotees are the real friends of all living entities. Offering their minds
unto You and enjoying transcendental bliss, they are expert in achieving the real goal of life. O Lord, You
are the soul and dear friend of such devotees, who never need return to this material world. How could
they give up engagement in Your devotional service?
Although nondevotees, because of their meager knowledge and speculative habits, cannot understand
the real nature of the Lord, a devotee who has once tasted the nectar from the Lord's lotus feet can realize
what transcendental pleasure there is in the Lord's devotional service. A devotee knows that simply by
rendering service to the Lord, he serves everyone. Therefore devotees are real friends to all living entities.
Only a pure devotee can preach the glories of the Lord for the benefit of all conditioned souls.

O Lord, O personified three worlds, father of the three worlds! O strength of the three worlds, in the
form of the Vamana incarnation! O three-eyed form of Nrsimhadeva! O most beautiful person within the
three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the
Danavas, is but an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in
Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You
appear as Lord Vamanadeva, Lord Rama and Lord Krsna. You appear sometimes as an animal like Lord
Boar, sometimes a mixed incarnation like Lord Nrsimhadeva and Lord Hayagriva, and sometimes an
aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the
demons and Danavas. We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You
so desire, to kill the great demon Vrtrasura.
There are two kinds of devotees, known as sakama and akama. Pure devotees are akama, whereas
devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called sakama because they still want
to enjoy material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the sakama devotees are promoted to the
higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The sakama
devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and Raksasas, but the Lord is so kind that He always
saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord's incarnations are so powerful that Lord Vamanadeva
covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The Lord is
called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three
steps.
The difference between sakama and akama devotees is that when sakama devotees, like the demigods,
fall into difficulty, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas akama devotees,
even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits. Even if an akama devotee is
suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He
never disturbs the Lord. Sakama devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty,
but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the
Lord. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer their prayers and service more
enthusiastically. In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home,
back to Godhead, without a doubt. Sakama devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they
desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted
herein that Lord Visnu, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees. Srila
Madhvacarya says: vividham bhava-patratvat sarve visnor vibhutayah. Krsna is the original Personality of
Godhead (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Visnu.

O Lord, as the small sparks of a fire cannot possibly perform the actions of the whole fire, we sparks of
Your Lordship cannot inform You of the necessities of our lives. You are the complete whole. Therefore,
of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic
manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation. You always engage in
Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied
energies. You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them. You
exist internally as Parabrahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation. Therefore,
although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the
Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes. Indeed, You are the original element. You are
the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them.
You are the witness of everything as Parabrahman and Paramatma. O Supreme Personality of Godhead,
nothing is unknown to You.
The Absolute Truth exists in three phases of spiritual understanding--Brahman, Paramatma and
Bhagavan (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate). Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
is the cause of Brahman and Paramatma. Brahman, the impersonal Absolute Truth, is all-pervading, and
Paramatma is locally situated in everyone's heart, but Bhagavan, who is worshipable by the devotees. is
the original cause of all causes. A pure devotee is aware that since nothing is unknown to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, He need not be informed of a devotee's conveniences and inconveniences. A pure
devotee knows that there is no need to ask the Absolute Truth for any material necessities. Therefore,
while informing the Supreme Lord about their distress in being attacked by Vrtrasura, the demigods
apologized for offering prayers for their safety. A neophyte devotee, of course, approaches the Supreme
Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for speculative knowledge of the Lord. Bhagavad-gita (7.16)
mentions four kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord--one who is distressed (arta),
one in need of money (artharthi), one who is inquisitive (jijnasu) and one who is searching for the
Absolute Truth (jnani). A pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and
omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one's personal benefit. A pure devotee
always engages in the service of the Lord without demanding anything. The Lord is present everywhere
and knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to disturb Him by asking Him
for material benefits.

spiritual master and You know everything, we have sought shelter of Your lotus feet for instruction.
Please give us relief by counteracting our present distress. Your lotus feet are the only shelter for a fully
surrendered devotee and are the only means for subduing all the tribulations of this material world.
One need only seek shelter of the shade of the Lord's lotus feet. Then all the material tribulations that
disturb him will be subdued, just as when one comes under the shadow of a big tree, the disturbances
caused by the heat of the scorching sun are immediately mitigated, without one's asking for relief.
Therefore the whole concern of the conditioned soul should be the lotus feet of the Lord. The conditioned
soul suffering from various tribulations because of existing in this material world can be relieved only
when he seeks shelter at the Lord's lotus feet.

"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me. O best among the
Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer
of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute."
The four classes of neophyte devotees who approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to offer
devotional service because of material motives are not pure devotees, but the advantage for such
materialistic devotees is that they sometimes give up their material desires and become pure. When the
demigods are utterly helpless, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead in grief and with tears
in their eyes, praying to the Lord, and thus they become almost pure devotees, free from material desires.
Admitting that they have forgotten pure devotional service because of extensive material opportunities,
they fully surrender to the Lord, leaving to His consideration whether to maintain them or annihilate
them. Such surrender is necessary. Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, marabi rakhabi--yo iccha tohara: "O
Lord, I fully surrender unto Your lotus feet. Now, as You desire, You may protect me or annihilate me.
You have the full right to do either."

O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and
activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Krsna, Your
reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything.
This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful. When the
conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world
for many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life. Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, we offer our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.
The demigods certainly wanted Lord Visnu to relieve their anxiety, but now they directly approach Lord
Krsna, for although there is no difference between Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu, Krsna descends to this
planet in His Vasudeva feature for the purpose of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--protecting
His devotees and annihilating the miscreants. Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or
devotees, and therefore Krsna descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His
devotees. Krsna, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Visnu and
Narayana, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord. As explained in
Brahma-samhita (5.46):
diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya
dipayate vivrta-hetu-samana-dharma
yas tadrg eva hi ca visnutaya vibhati
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Krsna expands Himself as Visnu the way a bright candle kindles another. Although there is no
difference between the power of one candle and another, Krsna is compared to the original candle.
The word mrsta-yasase is significant herein because Krsna is always famous for relieving His devotee
from danger. A devotee who has sacrificed everything for the service of Krsna and whose only source of
relief is the Lord is known as akincana.
As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kunti, the Lord is akincana-vitta, the property of such a
devotee. Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world,
where they achieve five kinds of liberation--sayujya, salokya, sarupya, sarsti and samipya. They personally
associate with the Lord in five mellows--santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya. These rasas are all
emanations from Krsna. As described by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the original mellow, adi-rasa, is
conjugal love. Krsna is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O beloved demigods, you have offered your prayers to Me
with great knowledge, and I am certainly most pleased with you. A person is liberated by such knowledge,
and thus he remembers My exalted position, which is above the conditions of material life. Such a devotee
is fully purified by offering prayers in full knowledge. This is the source of devotional service to Me.
Another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Uttamasloka, which means that He is offered
prayers with selected verses. Bhakti means sravanam kirtanam visnoh, chanting and hearing about Lord
Visnu. Impersonalists cannot be purified, for they do not offer personal prayers to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Even though they sometimes offer prayers, the prayers are not directed toward
the Supreme Person. Impersonalists sometimes show their incomplete knowledge by addressing the Lord
as being nameless. They always offer prayers indirectly, saying, "You are this, You are that," but they do
not know to whom they are praying. A devotee, however, always offers personal prayers. A devotee says,
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami: "I offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, unto Krsna."
That is the way to offer prayers. If one continues to offer such personal prayers to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, he is eligible to become a pure devotee and return home, back to Godhead.

When the demigods finished offering their prayers, they anxiously waited for their enemy Vrtrasura to
be killed. This means that the demigods are not pure devotees. Although without difficulty one can get
anything he desires if the Lord is pleased, the demigods aspire for material profit by pleasing the Lord.
The Lord wanted the demigods to pray for unalloyed devotional service, but instead they prayed for an
opportunity to kill their enemy. This is the difference between a pure devotee and a devotee on the
material platform. Indirectly, the Lord regretted that the demigods did not ask for pure devotional service.

na--not; veda--knows; krpanah--a miserly living entity; sreyah--the ultimate necessity; atmanah--of the
soul; guna-vastu-drk--who is attracted by the creation of the modes of material nature; tasya--of him; tan--
things created by the material energy; icchatah--desiring; yacchet--one bestows; yadi--if; sah api--he also;
tatha-vidhah--of the kind (a foolish krpana who does not know his real self-interest).
Those who think material assets to be everything or to be the ultimate goal of life are called misers
[krpanas]. They do not know the ultimate necessity of the soul. Moreover, if one awards that which is
desired by such fools, he must also be considered foolish.
There are two classes of men--namely the krpana and the brahmana. A brahmana is one who knows
Brahman, the Absolute Truth, and who thus knows his real interest. A krpana, however, is one who has a
material, bodily concept of life. Not knowing how to utilize his human or demigod life, a krpana is
attracted by things created by the material modes of nature. The krpanas, who always desire material
benefits, are foolish, whereas brahmanas, who always desire spiritual benefits, are intelligent. If a krpana,
not knowing his self-interest, foolishly asks for something material, one who awards it to him is also
foolish. Krsna, however, is not a foolish person; He is supremely intelligent. If someone comes to Krsna
asking for material benefits, Krsna does not award him the material things he desires. Instead, the Lord
gives him intelligence so that he will forget his material desires and become attached to the Lord's lotus
feet. In such cases, although the krpana offers prayers to Lord Krsna for material things, the Lord takes
away whatever material possessions the krpana has and gives him the sense to become a devotee. As
stated by the Lord in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.39):
ami--vijna, ei murkhe 'visaya' kene diba?
sva-caranamrta diya 'visaya' bhulaiba
"Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him
to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment." If one
sincerely prays to God for material possessions in exchange for devotional service, the Lord, who is not
foolish like such an unintelligent devotee, shows him special favor by taking away whatever material
possessions he has and gradually giving him the intelligence to be satisfied only by rendering service to
His lotus feet. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments in this regard that if a foolish child requests
his mother to give him poison, the mother, being intelligent, will certainly not give him poison, even
though he requests it. A materialist does not know that to accept material possessions means to accept
poison, or the repetition of birth and death. An intelligent person, a brahmana, aspires for liberation from
material bondage. That is the real self-interest of a human being.

svayam--personally; nihsreyasam--the supreme goal of life, namely the means of obtaining ecstatic love
for the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vit-van--one who is accomplished in devotional service; na--not;
vakti--teaches; ajnaya--unto a foolish person not conversant with the ultimate goal of life; karma--fruitive
activities; hi--indeed; na--not; rati--administers; roginah--unto the patient; apathyam--something

A pure devotee who is fully accomplished in the science of devotional service will never instruct a
foolish person to engage in fruitive activities for material enjoyment, not to speak of helping him in such
activities. Such a devotee is like an experienced physician, who never encourages a patient to eat food
injurious to his health, even if the patient desires it.
Here is the difference between the benedictions awarded by the demigods and those awarded by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Devotees of the demigods ask for benedictions simply for sense
gratification, and therefore they have been described in Bhagavad-gita (7.20) as bereft of intelligence.
kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah
prapadyante 'nya-devatah
tam tam niyamam asthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the
particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures."
Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of profound desires for sense gratification.
They do not know what benedictions to ask. Therefore nondevotees are advised in the sastras to worship
various demigods to achieve material benefits. For example, if one wants a beautiful wife, he is advised to
worship Uma, or goddess Durga. If one wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sungod.
All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust. The benedictions
will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them. If one
approaches Lord Visnu for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return
home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
Lord Visnu, or Lord Krsna, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in His service how to approach
Him at the end of his material body. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities, does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." This is the
benediction of Lord Visnu, Krsna. After giving up his body, a devotee returns home, back to Godhead.
A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord Krsna does not give him such
benedictions, despite the devotee's prayers. Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not
generally become devotees of Krsna or Visnu. Instead they become devotees of the demigods (kamais tais
tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah). The benedictions of the demigods, however, are condemned
in Bhagavad-gita. Antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: "Men of small intelligence
worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." A non-Vaisnava, one who is not
engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered a fool with a small quantity
of brain substance.

That saintly Dadhyanca, who is also known as Dadhici, personally assimilated the spiritual science and
then delivered it to the Asvini-kumaras. It is said that Dadhyanca gave them mantras through the head of
a horse. Therefore the mantras are called Asvasira. After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from
Dadhici, the Asvini-kumaras became jivan-mukta, liberated even in this life.
The following story is narrated by many acaryas in their commentaries:
nisamyatharvanam daksam pravargya-brahmavidyayoh; dadhyancam samupagamya tam ucatur

etac chrutva tadovaca dadhyann atharvanas tayoh pravargyam brahma-vidyam ca sat-krto 'satya-sankitah.
The great saint Dadhici had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had
advanced spiritual knowledge as well. Knowing this, the Asvini-kumaras once approached him and
begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidya). Dadhici Muni replied, "I am now
engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities. Come back some time later." When the Asvinikumaras
left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadhici and said, "My dear Muni, the Asvinikumaras
are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual
science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head." After warning Dadhici
in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The Asvini-kumaras, who understood Indra's desires, returned and
begged Dadhici for brahma-vidya. When the great saint Dadhici informed them of Indra's threat, the
Asvini-kumaras replied, "Let us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse. You can
instruct brahma-vidya through the horse's head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall
reward you and restore your original head." Since Dadhici had promised to impart brahma-vidya to the
Asvini-kumaras, he agreed to their proposal. Therefore, because Dadhici imparted brahma-vidya through
the mouth of a horse, this brahma-vidya is also known as Asvasira.

When Vrtrasura is killed because of My spiritual strength, you will regain your strength, weapons and
wealth. Thus there will be all good fortune for all of you. Although Vrtrasura can destroy all the three
worlds, do not fear that he will harm you. He is also a devotee and will never be envious of you.
A devotee of the Lord is never envious of anyone, what to speak of other devotees. As revealed later,
Vrtrasura was also a devotee. Therefore be was not expected to be envious of the demigods. Indeed, of his
own accord, he would try to benefit the demigods. A devotee does not hesitate to give up his own body
for a better cause. Canakya Pandita said, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati. After all, all one's
material possessions, including his body, will be destroyed in due course of time. Therefore if the body
and other possessions can be utilized for a better cause, a devotee never hesitates to give up even his own
body. Because Lord Visnu wanted to save the demigods, Vrtrasura, even though able to swallow the three
worlds, would agree to be killed by the demigods. For a devotee there is no difference between living and
dying because in this life a devotee engages in devotional service, and after giving up his body, he engages
in the same service in the spiritual world. His devotional service is never hindered.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Ninth Chapter, Sixth Canto, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura."
Chapter Ten
The Battle Between the Demigods and Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a thunderbolt was prepared from
Dadhici's bones, and a fight took place between Vrtrasura and the demigods.
Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhici Muni
and begged for his body. Dadhici Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion,
jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after
death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals. Dadhici Muni first merged his gross
body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he gave up his gross body. With the help of
Visvakarma, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici's bones. Armed with the
thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.
At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga. a great fight took place between the demigods
and the asuras. Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle. leaving
Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself. Vrtrasura, however, seeing the demons fleeing,
instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield. One who is victorious in battle
gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial
heavens. In either way, the fighter benefits.

anything he might want as charity.
This verse describes two people--one who gives charity and one who begs for it. A beggar should not ask
charity from a person who is in difficulty. Similarly, one who is able to give charity should not deny a
beggar. These are the moral instructions of the sastra. Canakya Pandita says, san-nimitte varam tyago
vinase niyate sati: everything within this material world will be destroyed, and therefore one should use
everything for good purposes. If one is advanced in knowledge, he must always be prepared to sacrifice
anything for a better cause. At the present moment the entire world is in a dangerous position under the
spell of a godless civilization. The Krsna consciousness movement needs many exalted, learned persons
who will sacrifice their lives to revive God consciousness throughout the world. We therefore invite all
men and women advanced in knowledge to join the Krsna consciousness movement and sacrifice their
lives for the great cause of reviving the God consciousness of human society.

O demigods, one who has no compassion for humanity in its suffering and does not sacrifice his
impermanent body for the higher causes of religious principles or eternal glory is certainly pitied even by
the immovable beings.
In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis of
Vrndavana. Concerning Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.34):
tyaktva sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmim
dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam
maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad
vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam
"We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord. upon whom one should always
meditate. He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of
heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material
energy." To accept sannyasa means to commit civil suicide. but sannyasa is compulsory, at least for every
brahmana, every first-class human being. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife
and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing
that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all
the fallen souls of the world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa and left home when He was only
twenty-four years old. He lived a very strict life as a sannyasi, refusing all bodily comforts. Similarly, His
disciples the six Gosvamis were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left
everything to join the movement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srinivasa Acarya says:
tyaktva turnam asesa-mandala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat
bhutva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-kanthasritau
These Gosvamis left their very comfortable lives as ministers. Zamindars and learned scholars and
joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (dinaganesakau
karunaya). Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and
torn quilts (kaupina-kantha). they lived in Vrndavana and followed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's order to
excavate Vrndavana's lost glories.
Similarly. everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the Krsna
consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls. The words bhuta-dayaya, maya-mrgam
dayitayepsitam and dina-ganesakau karunaya all convey the same sense. These are very significant words
for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life. One should join the
Krsna consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the six Gosvamis and, before them, the great sage Dadhici. Instead of wasting one's life for
temporary bodily comforts. one should always be prepared to give up one's life for better causes. After all,
the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious
principles throughout the world.

If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious
principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.
One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties
according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious
principles are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others
happy. Atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on
this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence--ahimsah parama-dharmah--is established.
We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living
beings. Lord Buddha's mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the
greatest religious principle is nonviolence.
One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man. That is the greatest
hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, "Do not kill," but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of
slaughterhouses while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse. One should be
happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy. This is the principle to be
followed. Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the
happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals. That is not recommended herein. This
verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human.
animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Krsna says
in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this
material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father." The different forms of these living entities are only
their external dresses. Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God. Therefore one
should not favor only one kind of living being. A Vaisnava sees all living entities as part and parcel of
God. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (5.18 and 18.54):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]."
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state
he attains pure devotional service unto Me." A Vaisnava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he
laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy. A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; he
is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism. Therefore a Vaisnava
is always busy preaching Krsna consciousness throughout the world.

This body, which is eatable by jackals and dogs after death, does not actually do any good for me, the
spirit soul. It is usable only for a short time and may perish at any moment. The body and its possessions,
its riches and relatives, must all be engaged for the benefit of others, or else they will be sources of
tribulation and misery.
Similar advice is also given in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.22.35):
etavaj janma-saphalyam
dehinam iha dehisu
pranair arthair dhiya vaca
sreya-acaranam sada
"It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life,
wealth, intelligence and words." This is the mission of life. One's own body and the bodies of his friends
and relatives, as well as one's own riches and everything else one has, should be engaged for the benefit of
others. This is the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 9.41):
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
"One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India [Bharata-varsa] should make his life
successful and work for the benefit of all other people.
The word upakuryat means para-upakara, helping others. Of course, in human society there are many
institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity
for philanthropy is ineffectual. They do not know the ultimate goal of life (sreya acaranam), which is to
please the Supreme Lord. If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving
the ultimate goal of life--to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead--they would all be perfect.
Humanitarian work without Krsna is nothing. Krsna must be brought to the center of all our activities;
otherwise no activity will have value.

tanum--his body; pare--to the Supreme; bhagavati--Personality of Godhead; brahmani--the Supreme
Brahman; atmanam--himself. the spirit soul; sannayan--offering; jahau--gave up.
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Dadhici Muni, the son of Atharva, thus resolved to give his body to the
service of the demigods. He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.
As indicated by the words pare bhagavati brahmany atmanam sannayan, Dadhici placed himself, as
spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, one may refer to the
incident of Dhrtarastra's leaving his body, as described in the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.13.55). Dhrtarastra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of
which it was made--earth, water, fire, air and ether--and distributed them to the different reservoirs of
these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original mahat-tattva. By
identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections
and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this
connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united
with the large sky outside the pot. Mayavadi philosophers misunderstand this description of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Therefore Sri Ramanuja Svami, in his book Vedanta-tattva-sara, has described that this
merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements--
earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence--the individual soul engages himself in
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah. anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam). The material cause of the material
elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position. As described by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': the constitutional position of the
living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Krsna. When one overcomes the material body through
cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus
engage in the service of the Lord.

Dadhici Muni controlled his senses, life force, mind and intelligence and became absorbed in trance.
Thus he cut all his material bonds. He could not perceive how his material body became separated from
his self.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.5):
anta-kale ca mam eva
smaran muktva kalevaram
yah prayati sa mad-bhavam
yati nasty atra samsayah
"Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this
there is no doubt." Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect yogi,
namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Krsna. He does not feel his material body being separated
from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti
mam eti: the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again. but is transferred back home, back
to Godhead. This yoga, bhakti-yoga, is the highest yoga system, as explained by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith. worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." The bhakti-yogi always thinks
of Krsna, and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to Krsnaloka, without even
perceiving the pains of death.

Thereafter, at the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga, a fierce battle took place between
the demigods and the demons on the bank of the Narmada.
Herein the Narmada does not mean the Narmada River in India. The five sacred rivers in India--Ganga,
Yamuna, Narmada, Kaveri and Krsna--are all celestial. Like the Ganges River, the Narmada River also
flows in the higher planetary systems. The battle between the demigods and the demons took place in the
higher planets.
The words prathame yuge mean "in the beginning of the first millennium," that is to say, in the
beginning of the Vaivasvata manvantara. In one day of Brahma there are fourteen Manus, who each live
for seventy-one millenniums. The four yugas--Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali--constitute one millennium.
We are presently in the manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (imam
vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam. vivasvan manave praha). We are now in the twenty-eighth
millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu's first
millennium. One can historically calculate how long ago the battle took place. Since each millennium
consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years
have passed since the battle took place on the bank of the River Narmada.

effulgence was intolerable to the demons.

Many hundreds and thousands of demons, demi-demons, Yaksas, Raksasas [man-eaters] and others,
headed by Sumali and Mali, resisted the armies of King Indra, which even death personified cannot easily
overcome. Among the demons were Namuci, Sambara, Anarva, Dvimurdha, Rsabha, Asura, Hayagriva,
Sankusira, Vipracitti, Ayomukha, Puloma, Vrsaparva, Praheti, Heti and Utkala. Roaring tumultuously and
fearlessly like lions, these invincible demons, all dressed in golden ornaments, gave pain to the demigods
with weapons like clubs, bludgeons, arrows, barbed darts, mallets and lances.

planetary systems and be always celebrated here by dying a suitable death, what man will not accept such
a glorious death?
If by dying one can be elevated to the higher planetary systems and be ever-famous after his death, who
is so foolish that he will refuse such a glorious death? Similar advice was also given by Krsna to Arjuna.
"My dear Arjuna," the Lord said, "do not desist from fighting. If you gain victory in the fight, you will
enjoy a kingdom, and even if you die you will be elevated to the heavenly planets." Everyone should be
ready to die while performing glorious deeds. A glorious person is not meant to meet death like cats and
dogs.

There are two ways to meet a glorious death, and both are very rare. One is to die after performing
mystic yoga, especially bhakti-yoga, by which one can control the mind and living force and die absorbed
in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The second is to die on the battlefield, leading the
army and never showing one's back. These two kinds of death are recommended in the sastra as glorious.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Battle Between the Demigods and Vrtrasura."
Chapter Eleven
The Transcendental Qualities of Vrtrasura
This chapter describes Vrtrasura's great qualities. When the prominent commanders of the demons fled,
not hearing Vrtrasura's advice. Vrtrasura condemned them all as cowards. Speaking very bravely, he stood
alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw Vrtrasura's attitude, they were so afraid that they
practically fainted, and Vrtrasura began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of
the demigods, threw his club at Vrtrasura, but Vrtrasura was such a great hero that he easily caught the
club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra's elephant. Struck by the blow of Vrtrasura, the elephant
was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.
King Indra had first accepted Visvarupa as his priest and thereafter killed him. Reminding Indra of his
heinous activities, Vrtrasura said, "If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu,
and depends on Lord Visnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably
available. Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind
that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional
service. Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the
glories of the Lord and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make
friendships with the devotees of the Lord. I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems,
even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world.
I have no need for such things."

O demigods, these demoniac soldiers have taken birth uselessly. Indeed, they have come from the
bodies of their mothers exactly like stool. What is the benefit of killing such enemies from behind while
they are running in fear? One who considers himself a hero should not kill an enemy who is afraid of
losing his life. Such killing is never glorious, nor can it promote one to the heavenly planets.
Vrtrasura rebuked both the demigods and the demoniac soldiers because the demons were running in
fear of their lives and the demigods were killing them from behind. The actions of both were abominable.
When a fight takes place, the opposing parties must be prepared to fight like heroes. A hero never runs
from the field of battle. He always fights face to face, determined to gain victory or lay down his life in the
fight. That is heroic. Killing an enemy from behind is also inglorious. When an enemy turns his back and
runs in fear of his life, he should not be killed. This is the etiquette of military science.
Vrtrasura insulted the demoniac soldiers by comparing them to the stool of their mothers. Both stool
and a cowardly son come from the abdomen of the mother, and Vrtrasura said that there is no difference
between them. A similar comparison was given by Tulasi dasa, who commented that a son and urine both
come from the same channel. In other words, semen and urine both come from the genitals, but semen
produces a child whereas urine produces nothing. Therefore if a child is neither a hero nor a devotee, he
is not a son but urine. Similarly, Canakya Pandita also says:
ko 'rthah putrena jatena
yo na vidvan na dharmikah
kanena caksusa kim va
caksuh pidaiva kevalam
"What is the use of a son who is neither glorious nor devoted to the Lord? Such a son is like a blind eye,
which simply gives pain but cannot help one see."

O insignificant demigods, if you truly have faith in your heroism, if you have patience in the cores of
your hearts and if you are not ambitious for sense gratification, please stand before me for a moment.
Rebuking the demigods, Vrtrasura challenged, "O demigods, if you are actually heroes, stand before me
now and try to show your prowess. If you do not wish to fight, if you are afraid of losing your lives, I shall
not kill you, for unlike you, I am not so evil minded as to kill persons who are neither heroic nor willing
to fight. If you have faith in your heroism, please stand before me."

with his great strength, trampled the demigods beneath his feet on the battlefield the way a mad elephant
tramples hollow bamboos in the forest.

I shall thus be relieved of my obligations to the reactions of my karma, and my fortune will be to receive
the dust from the lotus feet of great devotees like Narada Muni.
Sri Narottama dasa Thakura sings:
ei chaya gosani yara, mui tara dasa
tan' sabara pada-renu mora panca-grasa
"I am the servant of the six Gosvamis, and the dust of their lotus feet provides my five kinds of food." A
Vaisnava always desires the dust of the lotus feet of previous acaryas and Vaisnavas. Vrtrasura was certain
that he would be killed in the battle with Indra, because this was the desire of Lord Visnu. He was
prepared for death because he knew that after his death he was destined to return home, back to
Godhead. This is a great destination, and it is achieved by the grace of a Vaisnava. Chadiya vaisnava-seva
nistara payeche keba: no one has ever gone back to Godhead without being favored by a Vaisnava. In this
verse, therefore, we find the words manasvinam pada-rajah prapatsye: "I shall receive the dust of the lotus
feet of great devotees." The word manasvinam refers to great devotees who always think of Krsna. They
are always peaceful, thinking of Krsna, and therefore they are called dhira. The best example of such a
devotee is Narada Muni. If one receives the dust of the lotus feet of a manasvi, a great devotee, he
certainly returns home, back to Godhead.

O King of the demigods, since I, your enemy, am standing before you, why don't you hurl your
thunderbolt at me? Although your attack upon me with your club was certainly useless, like a request of
money from a miser, the thunderbolt you carry will not be useless. You need have no doubts about this.
When King Indra threw his club at Vrtrasura, Vrtrasura caught it in his left hand and retaliated by using
it to strike the head of Indra's elephant. Thus Indra's attack was a disastrous failure. Indeed, Indra's
elephant was injured and thrown back fourteen yards. Therefore even though Indra stood with the
thunderbolt to hurl against Vrtrasura, he was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail.
Vrtrasura, however, being a Vaisnava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not fail, for Vrtrasura
knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Lord Visnu. Although Indra had
doubts because he could not understand that Lord Visnu's order never fails, Vrtrasura understood Lord
Visnu's purpose. Vrtrasura was eager to be killed by the thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord
Visnu's instructions because he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead. He was
simply waiting for the opportunity of the thunderbolt's being released. In effect, therefore, Vrtrasura told
Indra, "If you want to kill me, since I am your enemy, take this opportunity. Kill me. You will gain
victory, and I shall go back to Godhead. Your deed will be equally beneficial for both of us. Do it
immediately."

with Lord Visnu's order, there is no doubt that I shall be killed by the release of your thunderbolt. Lord
Visnu has sided with you. Therefore your victory, opulence and all good qualities are assured.
Vrtrasura not only assured King Indra that the thunderbolt was invincible, but also encouraged Indra to
use it against him as soon as possible. Vrtrasura was eager to die with the stroke of the thunderbolt sent
by Lord Visnu so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead. By hurling the thunderbolt,
Indra would gain victory and enjoy the heavenly planets, remaining in the material world for repeated
birth and death. Indra wanted to gain victory over Vrtrasura and thereby become happy, but that would
not at all be happiness. The heavenly planets are just below Brahmaloka, but as stated by the Supreme
Lord, Krsna, abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna: even if one achieves Brahmaloka, he must
still fall to the lower planetary systems again and again. However, if one goes back to Godhead, he never
returns to this material world. By killing Vrtrasura, Indra would not actually gain; he would remain in the
material world. Vrtrasura, however, would go to the spiritual world. Therefore victory was destined for
Vrtrasura, not for Indra.

destination of such great sages as Narada Muni, just as Lord Sankarsana has said.
The words aham samadhaya manah indicate that the most important duty at the time of death is to
concentrate one's mind. If one can fix his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna, Visnu, Sankarsana or any Visnu
murti, his life will be successful. To be killed while fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Sankarsana,
Vrtrasura asked Indra to release his vajra, or thunderbolt. He was destined to be killed by the thunderbolt
given by Lord Visnu; there was no question of its being baffled. Therefore Vrtrasura requested Indra to
release the thunderbolt immediately, and he prepared himself by fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Krsna.
A devotee is always ready to give up his material body, which is described herein as gramya-pasa, the rope
of material attachment. The body is not at all good; it is simply a cause of bondage to the material world.
Unfortunately, even though the body is destined for destruction, fools and rascals invest all their faith in
the body and are never eager to return home, back to Godhead.

Persons who fully surrender at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always think of
His lotus feet are accepted and recognized by the Lord as His own personal assistants or servants. The
Lord never bestows upon such servants the brilliant opulences of the upper, lower and middle planetary
systems of this material world. When one possesses material opulence in any of these three divisions of
the universe, his possessions naturally increase his enmity, anxiety, mental agitation, pride and
belligerence. Thus one goes through much endeavor to increase and maintain his possessions, and he
suffers great unhappiness when he loses them.
In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says:
ye yatha mam prapadyante
tams tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah
"As devotees surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O
son of Prtha." Both Indra and Vrtrasura were certainly devotees of the Lord, although Indra took
instructions from Visnu to kill Vrtrasura. The Lord was actually more favorable to Vrtrasura because after
being killed by Indra's thunderbolt, Vrtrasura would go back to Godhead, whereas the victorious Indra
would rot in this material world. Because both of them were devotees, the Lord awarded them the
respective benedictions they wanted. Vrtrasura never wanted material possessions, for he knew very well
the nature of such possessions. To accumulate material possessions, one must labor very hard, and when
he gets them he creates many enemies because this material world is always full of rivalry. If one becomes
rich, his friends or relatives are envious. For ekanta-bhaktas, unalloyed devotees, Krsna therefore never
provides material possessions. A devotee sometimes needs some material possessions for preaching, but
the possessions of a preacher are not like those of a karmi. A karmi's possessions are achieved as a result
of karma, but those of a devotee are arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to facilitate his
devotional activities. Because a devotee never uses material possessions for any purpose other than the
service of the Lord, the possessions of a devotee are not to be compared to those of a karmi.

Our Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, forbids His devotees to endeavor uselessly for religion,
economic development and sense gratification. O Indra, one can thus infer how kind the Lord is. Such
mercy is obtainable only by unalloyed devotees, not by persons who aspire for material gains.
There are four objectives in human life--namely, religiosity (dharma), economic development (artha),
sense gratification (kama), and liberation (moksa) from the bondage of material existence. People
generally aspire for religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, but a devotee has no other
desire than to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead both in this life and in the next. The special
mercy for the unalloyed devotee is that the Lord saves him from hard labor to achieve the results of
religion, economic development and sense gratification. Of course, if one wants such benefits, the Lord
certainly awards them. Indra, for example, although a devotee, was not much interested in release from
material bondage; instead, he desired sense gratification and a high standard of material happiness in the
heavenly planets. Vrtrasura, however, being an unalloyed devotee, aspired only to serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord arranged for him to go back to Godhead after his bodily
bondage was destroyed by Indra. Vrtrasura requested Indra to release his thunderbolt against him as soon
as possible so that both he and Indra would benefit according to their proportionate advancement in
devotional service.

attributes, and my body always engage in the loving service of Your Lordship?
This verse gives the sum and substance of devotional life. One must first become a servant of the servant
of the servant of the Lord (dasanudasa). Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised, and He also showed by His
own example, that a living entity should always desire to be a servant of the servant of the servant of
Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis (gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah). This means that one
must accept a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession and is a servant of the servant of the
Lord. Under his direction, one must then engage one's three properties, namely his body, mind and
words. The body should be engaged in physical activity under the order of the master, the mind should
think of Krsna incessantly, and one's words should be engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord. If one
is thus engaged in the loving service of the Lord, one's life is successful.

liberation if I have to give up Your lotus feet.
A pure devotee never desires to gain material opportunities by rendering transcendental loving service
to the Lord. A pure devotee desires only to engage in loving service to the Lord in the constant association
of the Lord and His eternal associates, as stated in the previous verse (dasanudaso bhavitasmi). As
confirmed by Narottama dasa Thakura:
tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa
janame janame haya, ei abhilasa
To serve the Lord and the servants of His servants, in the association of devotees, is the only objective of
a pure, unalloyed devotee.

always longs for him to return and satisfy her in all respects, I always yearn for the opportunity to render
direct service unto You.
A pure devotee always yearns to associate personally with the Lord and render service unto Him. The
examples given in this regard are most appropriate. A small baby bird is practically never satisfied except
when the mother bird comes to feed it, a small calf is not satisfied unless allowed to suck the milk from
the mother's udder, and a chaste, devoted wife whose husband is away from home is never satisfied until
she has the association of her beloved husband.

Chapter Twelve
Vrtrasura's Glorious Death
This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, killed Vrtrasura despite great reluctance.
After Vrtrasura finished speaking, he released his trident against King Indra with great anger, but Indra,
using his thunderbolt, which was many times more powerful than the trident, broke the trident to pieces
and cut off one of Vrtrasura's arms. Nevertheless, Vrtrasura used his remaining arm to strike Indra with
an iron mace, making the thunderbolt fall from Indra's hand. Indra, being very ashamed of this, did not
pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but Vrtrasura encouraged King Indra to pick it up and fight.
Vrtrasura then spoke to King Indra as follows, instructing him very well.
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead," he said, "is the cause of victory and defeat. Not knowing that
the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat
themselves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord. No one but Him has any
independence. The purusa (the enjoyer) and prakrti (the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it
is by His supervision that everything works systematically. Not seeing the hand of the Supreme in every
action, a fool considers himself the ruler and controller of everything. When one understands, however,
that the real controller is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities of the
world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity." Thus Indra and Vrtrasura not only fought, but also
engaged in philosophical discourses. Then they began to fight again.
This time Indra was more powerful, and he severed Vrtrasura's remaining arm. Vrtrasura then assumed
a gigantic form and swallowed King Indra, but Indra, being protected by the talisman known as Narayanakavaca,
was able to protect himself even within Vrtrasura's body. Thus he emerged from Vrtrasura's
abdomen and severed the demon's head from his body with his powerful thunderbolt. Severing the
demon's head took one complete year to accomplish.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Desiring to give up his body, Vrtrasura considered death in the battle preferable
to victory. O King Pariksit, he vigorously took up his trident and with great force attacked Lord Indra, the
King of heaven, just as Kaitabha had forcefully attacked the Supreme Personality of Godhead when the
universe was inundated.
Although Vrtrasura repeatedly encouraged Indra to kill him with the thunderbolt, King Indra was
morose at having to kill such a great devotee and was hesitant to throw it. Vrtrasura, disappointed that
King Indra was reluctant despite his encouragement, took the initiative very forcefully by throwing his
trident at Indra. Vrtrasura was not at all interested in victory; he was interested in being killed so that he
could immediately return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), tyaktva deham
punar janma naiti: after giving up his body, a devotee immediately returns to Lord Krsna and never
returns to accept another body. This was Vrtrasura's interest.

Vrtrasura continued: O Indra, no one is guaranteed of being always victorious but the original enjoyer,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan. He is the cause of creation, maintenance and
annihilation, and He knows everything. Being dependent and being obliged to accept material bodies,
belligerent subordinates are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." When
two parties fight, the fighting actually goes on under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is Paramatma, the Supersoul. Elsewhere in the Gita (3.27) the Lord says:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." The living entities work only under the
direction of the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she arranges facilities for the
living entities. The living entities are not independent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers
(karta).
Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As for the subordinate living entities, they
fight under the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Victory or defeat is not actually
theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature. Pride in victory, or
moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, niyatam kuru karma tvam
karma jyayo hy akarmanah: "Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction." The living
entity is ordered to act according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Supreme Lord.
Karmany evadhikaras te ma phalesu kadacana: "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you
are not entitled to the fruits of actions." One must act sincerely, according to his position. Victory or
defeat depends on the Lord.
Vrtrasura encouraged Indra, saying, "Don't be morose because of my victory. There is no need to stop
fighting. Instead, you should go on with your duty. When Krsna desires, you will certainly be victorious."
This verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the Krsna consciousness movement. We should not be
jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of Krsna, or
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat. Our only duty is to
work sincerely, so that our activities may be recognized by Krsna.

All living beings in all the planets of this universe, including the presiding deities of all the planets, are
fully under the control of the Lord. They work like birds caught in a net, who cannot move
independently.
The difference between the suras and the asuras is that the suras know that nothing can happen without
the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the asuras cannot understand the supreme will
of the Lord. In this fight, Vrtrasura is actually the sura, whereas Indra is the asura. No one can act
independently; rather, everyone acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Therefore victory and defeat come according to the results of one's karma, and the judgment is given by
the Supreme Lord (karmana-daiva-netrena). Since we act under the control of the Supreme according to
our karma, no one is independent, from Brahma down to the insignificant ant. Whether we are defeated
or victorious, the Supreme Lord is always victorious because everyone acts under His directions.

independent of the supreme will. Therefore it is said:

The three purusas--Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi-Visnu--the
material nature, the total material energy, the false ego, the five material elements, the material senses, the
mind, the intelligence and consciousness cannot create the material manifestation without the direction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As confirmed in the Visnu Purana, parasya brahmanah saktis tathedam akhilam jagat: whatever
manifestations we experience are nothing but various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
These energies cannot create anything independently. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram. "This material nature is working
under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving living beings." Only
under the direction of the Lord, the Supreme Person, can prakrti, which is manifested in twenty-four
elements, create different situations for the living entity. In the Vedas the Lord says:
madiyam mahimanam ca
parabrahmeti sabditam
vetsyasy anugrhitam me
samprasnair vivrtam hrdi
"Since everything is a manifestation of My energy, I am known as Parabrahman. Therefore everyone
should hear from Me about My glorious activities." The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (10.2), aham adir
hi devanam: "I am the origin of all the demigods." Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the
origin of everything, and no one is independent of Him. Srila Madhvacarya also says, anisa jiva-rupena:
the living entity is anisa, never the controller, but is always controlled. Therefore when a living entity
becomes proud of being an independent isvara, or god, that is his foolishness. Such foolishness is
described in the following verse.

A foolish, senseless person cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although always
dependent, he falsely thinks himself the Supreme. If one thinks, "According to one's previous fruitive
actions, one's material body is created by the father and mother, and the same body is annihilated by
another agent, as another animal is devoured by a tiger," this is not proper understanding. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself creates and devours the living beings through other living beings.
According to the conclusion of the philosophy known as karma-mimamsa, one's karma, or previous
fruitive activity, is the cause of everything, and therefore there is no need to work. Those who arrive at
this conclusion are foolish. When a father creates a child, he does not do so independently; he is induced
to do so by the Supreme Lord. As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Unless one receives dictation from the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who sits within everyone's heart, one cannot be induced to create anything. Therefore the
father and mother are not the creators of the living entity. According to the living entity's karma, fruitive
activities, he is put into the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of the mother.
Then according to the body of the mother and father (yatha-yoni yatha-bijam), the living entity accepts a
body and takes birth to suffer or enjoy. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of one's birth.
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one's being killed. No one is independent; everyone is
dependent. The true conclusion is that the only independent person is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Just as a person not inclined to die must nonetheless give up his longevity, opulence, fame and
everything else at the time of death, so, at the appointed time of victory, one can gain all these when the
Supreme Lord awards them by His mercy.
It is not good to be falsely puffed up, saying that by one's own effort one has become opulent, learned,
beautiful and so on. All such good fortune is achieved through the mercy of the Lord. From another point
of view, no one wants to die, and no one wants to be poor or ugly. Therefore, why does the living entity,
against his will, receive such unwanted troubles? It is due to the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead that one gains or loses everything material. No one is independent; everyone is
dependent on the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Lord. There is a common saying in Bengal that
the Lord has ten hands. This means that He has control everywhere--in the eight directions and up and
down. If He wants to take everything away from us with His ten hands, we cannot protect anything with
our two hands. Similarly, if He wants to bestow benedictions upon us with His ten hands, we cannot
factually receive them all with our two hands; in other words, the benedictions exceed our ambitions. The
conclusion is that even though we do not wish to be separated from our possessions, sometimes the Lord
forcibly takes them from us; and sometimes He showers such benedictions upon us that we are unable to
receive them all. Therefore either in opulence or in distress we are not independent; everything is
dependent on the sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sattvam rajas tama iti
prakrter natmano gunah
tatra saksinam atmanam
yo veda sa na badhyate
sattvam--the mode of goodness; rajah--the mode of passion; tamah--the mode of ignorance; iti--thus;
prakrteh--of the material nature; na--not; atmanah--of the spirit soul; gunah--the qualities; tatra--in such a
position; saksinam--an observer; atmanam--the self; yah--anyone who; veda--knows; sah--he; na--not;
badhyate--is bound.
One who knows that the three qualities--goodness, passion and ignorance--are not qualities of the soul
but qualities of material nature, and who knows that the pure soul is simply an observer of the actions
and reactions of these qualities, should be understood to be a liberated person. He is not bound by these
qualities.
As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he
attains pure devotional service unto Me." When one attains self-realization, the brahma-bhuta stage, one
knows that whatever happens during his life is due to the contamination of the modes of material nature.
The living being, the pure soul, has nothing to do with these modes. In the midst of the hurricane of the
material world, everything changes very quickly, but if one remains silent and simply observes the actions
and reactions of the hurricane, he is understood to be liberated. The real qualification of the liberated soul
is that he remains Krsna conscious, undisturbed by the actions and reactions of the material energy. Such
a liberated person is always jubilant. He never laments or aspires for anything. Since everything is
supplied by the Supreme Lord, the living entity, being fully dependent on Him, should not protest or
accept anything in terms of his personal sense gratification; rather, he should receive everything as the
mercy of the Lord and remain steady in all circumstances.

O my enemy, just look at me. I have already been defeated, for my weapon and arm have been cut to
pieces. You have already overwhelmed me, but nonetheless, with a desire to kill you, I am trying my best
to fight. I am not at all morose, even under such adverse conditions. Therefore you should give up your
moroseness and continue fighting.
Vrtrasura was so great and powerful that in effect he was acting as the spiritual master of Indra.
Although Vrtrasura was on the verge of defeat, he was not at all affected. He knew that he was going to be
defeated by Indra, and he voluntarily accepted that, but since he was supposed to be Indra's enemy, he
tried his best to kill Indra. Thus he performed his duty. One should perform his duty under all
circumstances, even though one may know what the result will be.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Hearing the straightforward, instructive words of Vrtrasura, King Indra praised
him and again took the thunderbolt in his hand. Without bewilderment or duplicity, he then smiled and
spoke to Vrtrasura as follows.
King Indra, the greatest of the demigods, was astonished to hear the instructions of Vrtrasura, who was
supposed to be a demon. He was struck with wonder that a demon could speak so intelligently. Then he
remembered great devotees like Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja, who had been born in the families
of demons, and thus he came to his senses. Even so-called demons sometimes have exalted devotion for
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Indra smiled reassuringly at Vrtrasura.

Indra said: O great demon, I see by your discrimination and endurance in devotional service, despite
your dangerous position, that you are a perfect devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
Supersoul and friend of everyone.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.22):
yam labdhva caparam labham
manyate nadhikam tatah
yasmin sthito na duhkhena
gurunapi vicalyate
"Established in Krsna consciousness, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks
there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of the
greatest difficulty." An unalloyed devotee is never disturbed by any kind of trying circumstance. Indra was
surprised to see that Vrtrasura, undisturbed, was fixed in devotional service to the Lord, for such a
mentality is impossible for a demon. However, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
anyone can become an exalted devotee (striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te 'pi yanti param gatim). An unalloyed
devotee is sure to return home, back to Godhead.

bhavan--your good self; atarsit--has surmounted; mayam--the illusory energy; vai--indeed; vaisnavim--of
Lord Visnu; jana-mohinim--which deludes the mass of people; yat--since; vihaya--giving up; asuram--of
the demons; bhavam--the mentality; maha-purusatam--the position of an exalted devotee; gatah--
obtained.
You have surmounted the illusory energy of Lord Visnu, and because of this liberation, you have given
up the demoniac mentality and have attained the position of an exalted devotee.
Lord Visnu is the maha-purusa. Therefore one who becomes a Vaisnava attains the position of a mahapaurusya.
This position was attained by Maharaja Pariksit. It is said in the Padma Purana that the
distinction between a demigod and a demon is that a demigod is a devotee of Lord Visnu whereas a
demon is just the opposite: visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva asuras tad-viparyayah. Vrtrasura was considered a
demon, but actually he was more than qualified as a devotee, or maha-paurusya. If one somehow becomes
a devotee of the Supreme Lord, whatever his position, he can be brought to the position of a perfect
person. This is possible if an unalloyed devotee tries to serve the Lord by delivering him in this way.
Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami says in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye 'nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
"Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhiras, Sumbhas, Yavanas and members of the Khasa
races, and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord,
for He is the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." Anyone can be purified if
he takes shelter of a pure devotee and molds his character according to the pure devotee's direction. Then,
even if one is a Kirata, Andhra, Pulinda or whatever, he can be purified and elevated to the position of a
maha-paurusya.

O Vrtrasura, demons are generally conducted by the mode of passion. Therefore, what a great wonder it
is that although you are a demon, you have adopted the mentality of a devotee and have fixed your mind
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who is always situated in pure goodness.
King Indra wondered how Vrtrasura could have been elevated to the position of an exalted devotee. As
for Prahlada Maharaja, he was initiated by Narada Muni, and therefore it was possible for him to become a
great devotee, although he was born in a family of demons. For Vrtrasura, however, Indra could not
detect such causes. Therefore he was struck with wonder that Vrtrasura was such an exalted devotee that
he could fix his mind without deviation upon the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, Vasudeva.

A person fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, Hari, the Lord of the highest
auspiciousness, swims in the ocean of nectar. For him what is the use of the water in small ditches?
Vrtrasura has formerly prayed (Bhag. 6.11.25), na naka-prstham na ca paramesthyam na samabhaumam
na rasadhipatyam. "I do not want the facilities for happiness on Brahmaloka, Svargaloka or
even Dhruvaloka, not to speak of this earth or the lower planets. I simply want to return home, back to
Godhead." This is the determination of a pure devotee. A pure devotee is never attracted to any exalted
position within this material world. He simply wants to associate with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead like the inhabitants of Vrndavana--Srimati Radharani, the gopis, Krsna's father and mother
(Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda), Krsna's friends and Krsna's servants. He wants to associate with Krsna's
atmosphere of Vrndavana's beauty. These are the highest ambitions of a devotee of Krsna. Devotees of
Lord Visnu may aspire for a position in Vaikunthaloka, but a devotee of Krsna never aspires even for the
facilities of Vaikuntha; he wants to return to Goloka Vrndavana and associate with Lord Krsna in His
eternal pastimes. Any material happiness is like water in a ditch, whereas the spiritual happiness eternally
enjoyed in the spiritual world is like an ocean of nectar in which a devotee wants to swim.

Vrtrasura was very powerful in physical strength and influence. He placed his lower jaw on the ground
and his upper jaw in the sky. His mouth became very deep, like the sky itself, and his tongue resembled a

assuming a gigantic body, the great demon Vrtrasura shook even the mountains and began crushing the
surface of the earth with his legs, as if he were the Himalayas walking about. He came before Indra and
swallowed him and Airavata, his carrier, just as a big python might swallow an elephant.

O King Pariksit, subduer of enemies, the living spark then came forth from Vrtrasura's body and
returned home, back to Godhead. While all the demigods looked on, he entered the transcendental world
to become an associate of Lord Sankarsana.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that Indra, not Vrtrasura, was actually killed. He says that
when Vrtrasura swallowed King Indra and his carrier, the elephant, he thought, "Now I have killed Indra,
and therefore there is no more need of fighting. Now let me return home, back to Godhead." Thus he
stopped all his bodily activities and became situated in trance. Taking advantage of the silence of
Vrtrasura's body, Indra pierced the demon's abdomen, and because of Vrtrasura's trance, Indra was able to
come out. Now, Vrtrasura was in yoga-samadhi, and therefore although King Indra wanted to cut his days
to cut it to pieces. Actually it was the body left by Vrtrasura that was cut to pieces by Indra; Vrtrasura
himself was not killed. In his original consciousness, Vrtrasura returned home, back to Godhead, to
become an associate of Lord Sankarsana. Here the word alokam means the transcendental world,
Vaikunthaloka, where Sankarsana eternally resides.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Vrtrasura's Glorious Death."
Chapter Thirteen
King Indra Afflicted by Sinful Reaction
This chapter describes Indra's fear at having killed a brahmana (Vrtrasura), and it also describes how he
fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Visnu.
When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vrtrasura, he refused because Vrtrasura was a brahmana.
The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the
Narayana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Narayana. Even by a glimpse of
the chanting of Narayana's name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow
or a brahmana. The demigods advised Indra to perform an asvamedha sacrifice, by which Narayana would
be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the
entire universe.
Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vrtrasura, but when Vrtrasura was
killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vrtrasura's position. This is the nature of a great
personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he
acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing
a brahmana. Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and
there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to Manasa-sarovara, and there, under the
protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahusa
reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted
by the beauty of Indra's wife, Sacidevi, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a
serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted brahmanas and
saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a brahmana.

from trouble--everyone, that is, except Indra.

Thereafter, the demigods, the great saintly persons, the inhabitants of Pitrloka and Bhutaloka, the
demons, the followers of the demigods, and also Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the demigods subordinate to
Indra all returned to their respective homes. While departing, however, no one spoke to Indra.
In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments:

prapteh; tasmat tata ity anena manasa-sarovarad agatya pravartitad asvamedhat parata iti
vyakhyeyam.
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods returned to their respective abodes, but Indra did not,
for he was disturbed at having killed Vrtrasura, who was actually a brahmana. After killing Vrtrasura,
Indra went to the Manasa-sarovara Lake to become free from sinful reactions. When he left the lake, he
performed an asvamedha-yajna and then returned to his own abode.

sri-rajovaca

sri-raja uvaca--King Pariksit inquired; indrasya--of King Indra; anirvrteh--of the moroseness; hetum--the
reason; srotum--to hear; icchami--I wish; bhoh--O my lord; mune--O great sage, Sukadeva Gosvami;
yena--by which; asan--were; sukhinah--very happy; devah--all the demigods; hareh--of Indra; duhkham--
moroseness; kutah--from where; abhavat--was.
Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O great sage, what was the reason for Indra's
unhappiness? I wish to hear about this. When he killed Vrtrasura, all the demigods were extremely happy.
Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?
This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are
happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vrtrasura's having been
killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he
had killed a great devotee and brahmana. Vrtrasura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he
was a great devotee and therefore a great brahmana.
Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahlada Maharaja and
Bali Maharaja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real
culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while
fighting with Indra, Vrtrasura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vrtrasura was
transferred to Vaikunthaloka to become an associate of Sankarsana. Indra knew this, and therefore he was
morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaisnava or brahmana.
A Vaisnava is already a brahmana, although a brahmana may not be a Vaisnava. The Padma Purana says:
sat-karma-nipuno vipro
mantra-tantra-visaradah
avaisnavo gurur na syad
vaisnavah sva-paco guruh
One may be a brahmana in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge
(mantra-tantra-visaradah), but if he is not a Vaisnava, he cannot be a guru. This means that an expert
brahmana may not be a Vaisnava, but a Vaisnava is already a brahmana. A millionaire may very easily
possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not
necessarily a millionaire. Vrtrasura was a perfect Vaisnava, and therefore he was also a brahmana.

by killing one disturbing demon.
One who has killed a brahmana, one who has killed a cow or one who has killed his father, mother or
spiritual master can be immediately freed from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of
Lord Narayana. Other sinful persons, such as dog-eaters and candalas, who are less than sudras, can also
be freed in this way. But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by performing the great horse sacrifice.
If you please Lord Narayana in that way, why should you be afraid? You will be freed even if you kill the
entire universe, including the brahmanas, not to speak of killing a disturbing demon like Vrtrasura.
It is said in the Brhad-visnu Purana:
namno hi yavati saktih
papa-nirharane hareh
tavat kartum na saknoti
patakam pataki narah
Also, in the prema-vivarta by Jagadananda Pandita it is said:
eka krsna-name papira yata papa-ksaya
bahu janme sei papi karite naraya
This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of
more sins that he can even imagine performing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by
chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be
said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified
devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should
intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy
name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. Namno balad
yasya hi papa-buddhih: the Lord's holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities,
but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most
condemned.
These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds. In the Manu-samhita the following names are
given. A son begotten by a brahmana and born from the womb of a sudra mother is called a parasava or
nisada, a hunter accustomed to stealing. A son begotten by a nisada in the womb of a sudra woman is
called a pukkasa. A child begotten by a ksatriya in the womb of the daughter of a sudra is called an ugra.
A child begotten by a sudra in the womb of the daughter of a ksatriya is called a ksatta. A child begotten
by a ksatriya in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a svada, or dog-eater. All such offspring are
considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that
all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.
The Hare Krsna movement offers everyone a chance to be purified, regardless of birth or family. As
confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye 'nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
"Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhiras, Sumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races,
and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is
the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." Even such sinful persons can
certainly all be purified if they chant the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee.
Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill Vrtrasura even at the risk of brahma-hatya, the killing of a
brahmana, and they guarantee to release him from sinful reactions by performing an asvamedha-yajna.
Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the performer of sinful acts. This will be
seen from the following verse.

brahmanas; marutvan--Indra; ahanat--killed; ripum--his enemy, Vrtrasura; brahma-hatya--the sinful
reaction for killing a brahmana; hate--was killed; tasmin--when he (Vrtrasura); asasada--approached;
vrsakapim--Indra, who is also named Vrsakapi.
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Encouraged by the words of the sages, Indra killed Vrtrasura, and when he
was killed the sinful reaction for killing a brahmana [brahma-hatya] certainly took shelter of Indra.
After killing Vrtrasura, Indra could not surpass the brahma-hatya, the sinful reactions for killing a
brahmana. Formerly he had killed one brahmana, Visvarupa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time,
following the advice of the sages, he killed another brahmana purposely. Therefore the sinful reaction was
greater than before. Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for
atonement. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering,
the brahmanas allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the
strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing prayascitta, atonement, cannot give relief to
anyone, even to Indra or Nahusa. Nahusa was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was
going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.

Following the advice of the demigods, Indra killed Vrtrasura, and he suffered because of this sinful
killing. Although the other demigods were happy, he could not derive happiness from the killing of
Vrtrasura. Indra's other good qualities, such as tolerance and opulence, could not help him in his grief.
One cannot be happy by committing sinful acts, even if one is endowed with material opulence. Indra
found this to be true. People began to blaspheme him, saying, "This person has killed a brahmana for the
sake of enjoying heavenly material happiness." Therefore in spite of being King of heaven and enjoying
material opulence, Indra was always unhappy because of the accusations of the populace.

Indra saw personified sinful reaction chasing him, appearing like a candala woman, a woman of the

tuberculosis, her body and garments were covered with blood. Breathing an unbearable fishy odor that
polluted the entire street, she called to Indra, "Wait! Wait!"
When a person is afflicted with tuberculosis, he often vomits blood, which makes his garments bloody.

learned are always advised to read this narration. If one does so, one will become expert in the activities of
the senses, his opulence will increase, and his reputation will become widespread. One will also be
relieved of all sinful reactions, he will conquer all his enemies, and the duration of his life will increase.
Because this narration is auspicious in all respects, learned scholars regularly hear and repeat it on every
festival day.
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Indra Afflicted by Sinful Reaction."
Chapter Fourteen
King Citraketu's Lamentation
In this Fourteenth Chapter, Pariksit Maharaja asks his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, how such a
demon as Vrtrasura could become an exalted devotee. In this connection the previous life of Vrtrasura is
discussed. This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the
death of his son.
Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among
human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence.
Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the
association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination. And among many millions of
such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Narayana. Therefore such devotees are
extremely rare. Since bhakti, devotional service, is not ordinary, Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that an
asura could rise to the exalted position of a devotee. Being doubtful, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from
Sukadeva Gosvami, who then described Vrtrasura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the
King of Surasena.
Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Angira. When Angira inquired
from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the
great sage, the King's first wife, Krtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and
lamentation. Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy. The
co-wives of Krtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child. Citraketu
was overwhelmed by shock at his son's death. Then Narada Muni and Angira went to see him.

King Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O learned brahmana, demons are generally sinful, being

love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana?
In this material world, everyone is obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance. However, unless
one conquers these modes and comes to the platform of goodness, there is no chance of one's becoming a
pure devotee. This is confirmed by Lord Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." Since Vrtrasura was among the demons, Maharaja Pariksit wondered how it was possible
for him to have become such an exalted devotee.

O best of the brahmanas, Sukadeva Gosvami, out of many persons who follow religious principles, only
a few desire liberation from the material world. Among many thousands who desire liberation, one may
actually achieve liberation, giving up material attachment to society, friendship, love, country, home, wife
and children. And among many thousands of such liberated persons, one who can understand the true
meaning of liberation is very rare.
There are four classes of men, namely karmis, jnanis, yogis and bhaktas. This statement pertains
especially to karmis and jnanis. A karmi tries to he happy within this material world by changing from
one body to another. His objective is bodily comfort, either in this planet or in another. When such a
person becomes a jnani, however, be aspires for liberation from material bondage. Among many such
persons who aspire for liberation, one may actually be liberated during his life. Such a person gives up his
attachment for society, friendship, love, country, family, wife and children. Among many such persons,
who are in the vanaprastha stage, one may understand the value of becoming a sannyasi, completely
accepting the renounced order of life.

muktanam api siddhanam

kotisv api maha-mune
muktanam--of those who are liberated during this life (who are unattached to the bodily comforts of
society, friendship and love); api--even; siddhanam--who are perfect (because they understand the
insignificance of bodily comforts); narayana-parayanah--a person who has concluded that Narayana is the
Supreme; su-durlabhah--very rarely found; prasanta--fully pacified; atma--whose mind; kotisu--out of
millions and trillions; api--even; maha-mune--O great sage.
O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may
be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krsna. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring mukti, or
liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the
materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the
vanaprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the
platform of sannyasa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life.
Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone
liberated. Indeed, although many men take sannyasa to become liberated, because of their imperfections
they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.
Jnanis, yogis and karmis devoid of devotional service are called offenders. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
says, mayavadi krsne aparadhi: one who thinks that everything is maya instead of thinking that everything
is Krsna is called an aparadhi, or offender. Although the Mayavadis, impersonalists, are offenders at the
lotus feet of Krsna, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self.
They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life
is. If such a person becomes narayana-parayana, a devotee of Lord Narayana, he is better than a jivanmukta,
one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence.
There are two kinds of jnanis. One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal
realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is
said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sthula-tusavaghatinah). The other class of jnanis,
whose jnana is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds--those who are devoted to the so-called false form
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the actual spiritual form. The Mayavadi devotees worship Narayana or Visnu with
the idea that Visnu has accepted a form of maya and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The
pure devotee, however, never thinks that Visnu has accepted a body of maya; instead, he knows perfectly
well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in
knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32):
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
"O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure.
Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are
sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet." Evidence of
this same point is also given in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), wherein the Lord says:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be." When rascals (mudhas) see that Krsna acts exactly like a human
being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the param bhavam, His
transcendental form and activities. Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gita (9.12) as follows:
moghasa mogha-karmano
mogha-jnana vicetasah
raksasim asurim caiva
prakrtim mohinim sritah
"Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded
condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all
defeated." Such persons do not know that Krsna's body is not material. There is no distinction between
Krsna's body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Krsna as a human being, they deride Him.
They cannot imagine how a person like Krsna could be the origin of everything (govindam adi-purusam
tam aham bhajami). Such persons are described as moghasah, baffled in their hopes. Whatever they desire
for the future will be baffled. Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as
moghasah because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.
Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated,
because this is not the result of devotional service. However, they are also given a chance to engage in
devotional service and be purified. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted."
Unless the dirt within the core of one's heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee.
Therefore the word sudurlabhah ("very rarely found") is used in this verse. Not only among hundreds and
thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found. Therefore
the words kotisv api are used herein. Srila Madhvacarya gives the following quotations from the Tantra
Bhagavata:
nava-kotyas tu devanam
rsayah sapta-kotayah
narayanayanah sarve
ye kecit tat-parayanah
"There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called narayanayana, devotees
of Lord Narayana. Among them, only a few are called narayana-parayana."
narayanayana deva
rsy-adyas tat-parayanah
brahmadyah kecanaiva syuh
siddho yogya-sukham labhan
The difference between the siddhas and narayana-parayanas is that direct devotees are called narayanaparayanas
whereas those who perform various types of mystic yoga are called siddhas.

O King Pariksit, in the province of Surasena there was a king named Citraketu, who ruled the entire
earth. During his reign, the earth produced all the necessities for life.
Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life
during the time of King Citraketu. As stated in the Isopanisad (Mantra 1):
isavasyam idam sarvam
yat kinca jagatyam jagat
tena tyaktena bhunjitha
ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam
"Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One
should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one
should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong." Krsna, the supreme controller, has
created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity. The Lord supplies the
necessities of all living entities. These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of
supply. When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly. However,
when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity. This is the significance of the word kamadhuk.
Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.10.4) it is said, kamam vavarsa parjanyah sarva-kama-dugha mahi:
"During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the
earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion." We have experience that in some seasons the
rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity. We have no control over the earth's
productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His
order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently. If a pious king rules the earth
according to the sastric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to
provide for all men. There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough. Blackmarketeering
and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop. Simply ruling the land cannot solve
man's problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities. He must be like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Pariksit
Maharaja or Ramacandra. Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.

Citraketu, the husband of these millions of wives, was endowed with a beautiful form, magnanimity and
youth. He was born in a high family, he had a complete education, and he was wealthy and opulent.
Nevertheless, in spite of being endowed with all these assets, he was full of anxiety because he did not
have a son.
It appears that the King first married one wife, but she could not bear a child. Then he married a
second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children. In spite of the material
assets of janmaisvarya-sruta-sri--birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and
beauty--he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son. Certainly
his grief was natural. Grhastha life does not mean having a wife and no children. Canakya Pandita says,
putra-hinam grham sunyam: if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert. The King was
certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times.
Ksatriyas especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so. Nonetheless, he had
no issue.

elements is happy. Without these seven elements one cannot exist. Similarly, a king is always protected by
seven elements--his instructor (svami or guru), his ministers, his kingdom, his fort, his treasury, his royal
order and his friends.

A king is not alone. He first has his spiritual master, the supreme guide. Then come his ministers, his
kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies. If these
seven are properly maintained, the king is happy. Similarly, as explained in Bhagavad-gita (dehino 'smin
yatha dehe), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the mahat-tattva, ego and pancatanmatra,
the five objects of sense gratification. When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is
in a mood of pleasure. Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be
happy. Therefore the great sage Angira Rsi inquired about the King's personal health and the good fortune
of his seven associates. When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not
only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants.
All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy.

O King, O lord of humanity, when a king directly depends upon his associates and follows their
instructions, he is happy. Similarly, when his associates offer their gifts and activities to the king and
follow his orders, they are also happy.
The actual happiness of a king and his dependents is described in this verse. A king should not simply
give orders to his dependents because he is supreme; sometimes he must follow their instructions.
Similarly, the dependents should depend on the king. This mutual dependence will make everyone happy.

According to Vedic civilization, one gets married simply to have a son, who is needed to offer oblations
to his forefathers. King Citraketu responsibly desired to beget a child so that he and his forefathers might
be delivered from the darkest regions. He was concerned with how to get pinda, oblations, in the next life,
not only for himself but also for his forefathers. Therefore he requested Angira Rsi to favor him by doing

Thereafter, the great sage told the King, "O great King, now you will have a son who will be the cause of
both jubilation and lamentation." The sage then left, without waiting for Citraketu's response.
The word harsa means "jubilation," and soka means "lamentation." The King was overwhelmed with
joy when he understood that he would have a son. Because of his great jubilation, he could not actually
understand the statement of the sage Angira. He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be
jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King's only son and, being very
proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father. Thus the King was
satisfied, thinking, "Let there be a son. It does not matter if he is not very obedient." In Bengal there is a
proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind. The
King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all. The
great sage Canakya Pandita says:
ko 'rthah putrena jatena
yo na vidvan na dharmikah
kanena caksusa kim va
caksuh pidaiva kevalam
"What is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind,
diseased eye, which always causes suffering." Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one
wants to have a son even though he is useless. This attitude was represented in the history of King
Citraketu.

Alas, O Providence, O Creator, You are certainly inexperienced in creation, for during the lifetime of a
father You have caused the death of his son, thus acting in opposition to Your creative laws. If You are
determined to contradict these laws, You are certainly the enemy of living entities and are never merciful.
This is the way a conditioned soul condemns the supreme creator when he meets reverses. Sometimes
he accuses the Supreme Personality of Godhead of being crooked because some people are happy and
some are not. Here the Queen blames supreme providence for her son's death. Following the creative
laws, a father should die first and then his son. If the creative laws are changed according to the whims of
providence, then providence certainly should not be considered merciful, but must be considered inimical
to the created being. Actually it is not the creator, but the conditioned soul who is inexperienced. He does
not know how the subtle laws of fruitive activity work, and without knowledge of these laws of nature, he
ignorantly criticizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

My Lord, You may say that there is no law that a father must die in the lifetime of his son and that a son
must be born in the lifetime of his father, since everyone lives and dies according to his own fruitive
activity. However, if fruitive activity is so strong that birth and death depend upon it, there is no need of a
controller, or God. Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have
the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive
action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children. Since
You have cut the bonds of affection that compel a parent to raise his child, You appear inexperienced and
unintelligent.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita, karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam: one who has taken to
Krsna consciousness, devotional service, is not affected by the results of karma. In this verse, karma has
been stressed on the basis of karma-mimamsa philosophy, which says that one must act according to his
karma and that a supreme controller must give the results of karma. The subtle laws of karma, which are
controlled by the Supreme, cannot be understood by ordinary conditioned souls. Therefore Krsna says
that one who can understand Him and how He is acting, controlling everything by subtle laws,
immediately becomes freed by His grace. That is the statement of Brahma-samhita (karmani nirdahati
kintu ca bhakti-bhajam). One should take to devotional service without reservations and surrender
everything to the supreme will of the Lord. That will make one happy in this life and the next.

Therefore I request you not to go any further with the merciless Yama.
According to the Vedic injunctions, one must accept a wife just to beget a son who can deliver one from
the clutches of Yamaraja. Unless one has a son to offer oblations to the pitas, or forefathers, one must
suffer in Yamaraja's kingdom. King Citraketu was very much aggrieved. thinking that because his son was
going away with Yamaraja he himself would again suffer. The subtle laws exist for the karmis; if one
becomes a devotee, he has no more obligations to the laws of karma.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Citraketu's Lamentation."
Chapter Fifteen
The Saints Narada and Angira Instruct King Citraketu
In this chapter, Angira Rsi, along with Narada, consoles Citraketu as far as possible. Angira and Narada
Rsi came to relieve the King from excessive lamentation by instructing him about the spiritual significance
of life.
The great saints Angira and Narada explained that the relationship between father and son is not factual;
it is simply a representation of the illusory energy. The relationship did not exist before, nor will it stay in
the future. By the arrangement of time, the relationship exists only in the present. One should not lament
for temporary relationships. The entire cosmic manifestation is temporary; although not unreal, it is not
factual. By the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything created in the material world
is transient. By a temporary arrangement, a father begets a child, or a living entity becomes the child of a
so-called father. This temporary arrangement is made by the Supreme Lord. Neither the father nor the son
exists independently.
As the King listened to the great sages, he was relieved from his false lamentation, and then he inquired
about their identity. The great sages presented who they were and instructed that all sufferings are due to
the bodily conception of life. When one understands his spiritual identity and surrenders to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual person, one becomes actually happy. When one searches
for happiness in matter, one must certainly lament for bodily relationships. Self-realization means
spiritual realization of one's relationship with Krsna. Such realization ends one's miserable material life.

O King, what relationship does the dead body for which you lament have with you, and what

think this relationship existed before? Does it truly exist now? Will it continue in the future?
The instructions given by Narada and Angira Muni are the true spiritual instructions for the illusioned
conditioned soul. This world is temporary, but because of our previous karma we come here and accept
bodies, creating temporary relationships in terms of society, friendship, love, nationality and community,
which are all finished at death. These temporary relationships did not exist in the past, nor will they exist
in the future. Therefore at the present moment the so-called relationships are illusions.

O King, as small particles of sand sometimes come together and are sometimes separated due to the
force of the waves, the living entities who have accepted material bodies sometimes come together and are
sometimes separated by the force of time.
The misunderstanding of the conditioned soul is the bodily conception of life. The body is material, but
within the body is the soul. This is spiritual understanding. Unfortunately, one who is in ignorance, under
the spell of material illusion, accepts the body to be the self. He cannot understand that the body is
matter. Like small particles of sand, bodies come together and are separated by the force of time, and
people falsely lament for unification and separation. Unless one knows this, there is no question of
happiness. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (2.13) this is the first instruction given by the Lord:
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
We are not the body; we are spiritual beings trapped in the body. Our real interest lies in understanding
this simple fact. Then we can make further spiritual progress. Otherwise, if we remain in the bodily
conception of life, our miserable material existence will continue forever. Political adjustments, social
welfare work, medical assistance and the other programs we have manufactured for peace and happiness
will never endure. We shall have to undergo the sufferings of material life one after another. Therefore
material life is said to be duhkhalayam asasvatam; it is a reservoir of miserable conditions.

When seeds are sown in the ground, they sometimes grow into plants and sometimes do not. Sometimes
the ground is not fertile, and the sowing of seeds is unproductive. Similarly, sometimes a prospective
father, being impelled by the potency of the Supreme Lord, can beget a child, but sometimes conception
does not take place. Therefore one should not lament over the artificial relationship of parenthood, which
is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Lord.
Maharaja Citraketu was actually not destined to get a son. Therefore although he married hundreds and
thousands of wives, all of them proved barren, and he could not beget even one child. When Angira Rsi
came to see the King, the King requested the great sage to enable him to have at least one son. Because of
the blessing of Angira Rsi, a child was sent by the grace of maya, but the child was not to live for long.
Therefore in the beginning Angira Rsi told the King that he would beget a child who would cause
jubilation and lamentation.
King Citraketu was not destined to get a child by providence, or the will of the Supreme. Just as sterile
grain cannot produce more grain, a sterile person, by the will of the Supreme Lord, cannot beget a child.
Sometimes a child is born even to an impotent father and sterile mother, and sometimes a potent father
and fertile mother are childless. Indeed, sometimes a child is born despite contraceptive methods, and
therefore the parents kill the child in the womb. In the present age, killing children in the womb has
become a common practice. Why? When contraceptive methods are taken, why don't they act? Why is a
child sometimes produced so that the father and mother have to kill it in the womb? We must conclude
that our arrangement of so-called scientific knowledge cannot determine what will take place; what is
enacted actually depends on the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that we are situated in certain
conditions in terms of family, community and personality. These are all arrangements of the Supreme
Lord according to our desires under the spell of maya, illusion. In devotional life, therefore, one should
not desire anything, since everything depends on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11):
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." One should act only to develop Krsna consciousness. For everything else, one
should fully depend upon the Supreme Person. We should not create plans that will ultimately make us
frustrated.

O King, both you and us--your advisers, wives and ministers--as well as everything moving and not
moving throughout the entire cosmos at this time, are in a temporary situation. Before our birth this
situation did not exist, and after our death it will exist no longer. Therefore our situation now is
temporary, although it is not false.
The Mayavadi philosophers say, brahma satyam jagan mithya: Brahman, the living being, is factual, but
his present bodily situation is false. According to the Vaisnava philosophy, however, the present situation
is not false but temporary. It is like a dream. A dream does not exist before one falls asleep, nor does it
continue after one awakens. The period for dreaming exists only between these two, and therefore it is
false in the sense that it is impermanent. Similarly, the entire material creation, including our own
creation and those of others, is impermanent. We do not lament for the situation in a dream before the
dream takes place or after it is over, and so during the dream, or during a dreamlike situation, one should
not accept it as factual and lament about it. This is real knowledge.

who are created by Him; asvatantraih--not independent; anapeksah--not interested (in creation); api--

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master and proprietor of everything, is certainly not
interested in the temporary cosmic manifestation. Nonetheless, just as a boy at the beach creates
something in which he is not interested, the Lord, keeping everything under His control, causes creation,
maintenance and annihilation. He creates by engaging a father to beget a son, He maintains by engaging a
government or king to see to the public's welfare, and He annihilates through agents for killing, such as
snakes. The agents for creation, maintenance and annihilation have no independent potency, but because
of the spell of the illusory energy, one thinks himself the creator, maintainer and annihilator.
No one can independently create, maintain or annihilate. Bhagavad-gita (3.27) therefore says:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." Prakrti, material nature, as directed by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, induces all living entities to create, maintain or annihilate according
to the modes of nature. But the living entity, without knowledge of the Supreme Person and His agent the
material energy, thinks that he is the doer. In fact, he is not at all the doer. As an agent of the supreme
doer, the Supreme Lord, one should abide by the Lord's orders. The present chaotic conditions of the
world are due to the ignorance of leaders who forget that they have been appointed to act by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Because they have been appointed by the Lord, their duty is to consult the Lord
and act accordingly. The book for consultation is Bhagavad-gita, in which the Supreme Lord gives
directions. Therefore those who are engaged in creation, maintenance and annihilation should consult the
Supreme Person, who has appointed them, and should act accordingly. Then everyone will be satisfied,
and there will be no disturbances.

As from one seed another seed is generated, O King, so from one body [the body of the father], through
another body [the body of the mother], a third body is generated [the body of a son]. As the elements of
the material body are eternal, the living entity who appears through these material elements is also
eternal.
From Bhagavad-gita we understand that there are two energies, namely the superior energy and inferior
energy. Inferior energy consists of the five gross and three subtle material elements. The living entity. who
represents the superior energy, appears in different types of bodies through these elements by the
manipulation or supervision of the material energy. Actually both the material and spiritual energies--
matter and spirit--exist eternally as potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The potent entity is
the Supreme Person. Since the spiritual energy, the living being, who is part and parcel of the Supreme
Lord, desires to enjoy this material world, the Lord gives him a chance to accept different types of
material bodies and enjoy or suffer in different material conditions. Factually, the spiritual energy, the
living entity who desires to enjoy material things, is manipulated by the Supreme Lord. The so-called
father and mother have nothing to do with the living entity. As a result of his own choice and karma, the
living being takes different bodies through the agency of so-called fathers and mothers.

O great souls, I have heard that among the great and perfect persons wandering the surface of the earth
to instruct knowledge to people covered by ignorance are Sanat-kumara, Narada, Rbhu, Angira, Devala,
Asita, Apantaratama [Vyasadeva], Markandeya, Gautama, Vasistha, Bhagavan Parasurama, Kapila,
Sukadeva, Durvasa, Yajnavalkya, Jatukarna and Aruni. Others are Romasa, Cyavana, Dattatreya, Asuri,
Patanjali, the great sage Dhaumya who is like the head of the Vedas, the sage Pancasikha, Hiranyanabha,
Kausalya, Srutadeva and Rtadhvaja. You must certainly be among them.
The word jnana-hetavah is very significant because great personalities like those listed in these verses
wander on the surface of the globe not to mislead the populace, but to distribute real knowledge. Without
this knowledge, human life is wasted. The human form of life is meant for realization of one's relationship
with Krsna, or God. One who lacks this knowledge is categorized among the animals. The Lord Himself
says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me."
Ignorance is the bodily conception of life (yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke. .. sa eva go-kharah).
Practically everyone throughout the universe, especially on this planet, Bhurloka, thinks that there is no
separate existence of the body and soul and therefore no need of self-realization. But that is not a fact.
Therefore all the brahmanas listed here, being devotees, travel all over the world to awaken Krsna
consciousness in the hearts of such foolish materialists.
The acaryas mentioned in these verses are described in the Mahabharata. The word pancasikha is also
important. One who is liberated from the conceptions of annamaya, pranamaya, manomaya, vijnanamaya
and anandamaya and who is perfectly aware of the subtle coverings of the soul is called pancasikha.
According to the statements of the Mahabharata (Santi-parva, Chapters 218-219), an acarya named
Pancasikha took birth in the family of Maharaja Janaka, the ruler of Mithila. The Sankhya philosophers
accept Pancasikhacarya as one of them. Real knowledge pertains to the living entity dwelling within the
body. Unfortunately, because of ignorance, the living entity identifies himself with the body and therefore
feels pleasure and pain.

andhe--in blind; tamasi--darkness; magnasya--of one who is absorbed; jnana-dipah--the torchlight of

Because you are great personalities, you can give me real knowledge. I am as foolish as a village animal
like a pig or dog because I am merged in the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, please ignite the torch of
knowledge to save me.
This is the way to receive knowledge. One must submit oneself at the lotus feet of great personalities
who can actually deliver transcendental knowledge. It is therefore said, tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh
sreya uttamam: "One who is inquisitive to understand the highest goal and benefit of life must approach a
bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him." Only one who is actually eager to receive knowledge
to eradicate the darkness of ignorance is eligible to approach a guru, or spiritual master. The guru should
not be approached for material benefits. One should not approach a guru just to cure some disease or
receive some miraculous benefit. This is not the way to approach the guru. Tad-vijnanartham: one should
approach the guru to understand the transcendental science of spiritual life. Unfortunately, in this age of
Kali there are many bogus gurus who display magic to their disciples, and many foolish disciples want to
see such magic for material benefits. These disciples are not interested in pursuing spiritual life to save
themselves from the darkness of ignorance. It is said:
om ajnana-timirandhasya
jnananjana-salakaya
caksur unmilitam yena
tasmai sri-gurave namah
"I was born in the darkest ignorance, and my spiritual master opened my eyes with the torch of
knowledge. I offer my respectful obeisances unto him." This gives the definition of the guru. Everyone is
in the darkness of ignorance. Therefore everyone needs to be enlightened with transcendental knowledge.
One who enlightens his disciple and saves him from rotting in the darkness of ignorance in this material
world is a true guru.

My dear King, you are an advanced devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To be absorbed in
lamentation for the loss of something material is unsuitable for a person like you. Therefore we have both
come to relieve you from this false lamentation, which is due to your being merged in the darkness of
ignorance. For those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge to be affected by material loss and gain is
not at all desirable.
Several words in this verse are very important. The word maha-purusa refers to advanced devotees and
also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maha means "the supreme," and purusa means "person."
One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called maha-paurusika. Sukadeva Gosvami
and Maharaja Pariksit are sometimes addressed as maha-paurusika. A devotee should always aspire to
engage in the service of advanced devotees. As Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa
janame janame haya, ei abhilasa
A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service
of the Lord through the parampara system. One should serve the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
through the instructions of the great Gosvamis of Vrndavana. This is called tandera carana sevi. While
serving the lotus feet of the Gosvamis, one should live in the association of devotees (bhakta-sane vasa).
This is the business of a devotee. A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material
loss. When Angira Rsi and Narada saw that Maharaja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the
darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they
came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance.
Another significant word is brahmanya. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed
by the prayer namo brahmanya-devaya, which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the
devotees. Therefore this verse states, brahmanyo bhagavad-bhakto navasaditum arhasi. This is the
symptom of an advanced devotee. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma. For a devotee--an advanced, self-realized
soul--there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation. He is always transcendental to conditional
life.

My dear King, now you are actually experiencing the misery of a person who has sons and daughters. O
King, owner of the state of Surasena, one's wife, his house, the opulence of his kingdom, and his various
other opulences and objects of sense perception are all the same in that they are temporary. One's
kingdom, military power, treasury, servants, ministers, friends and relatives are all causes of fear, illusion,
lamentation and distress. They are like a gandharva-nagara, a nonexistent palace that one imagines to
exist in the forest. Because they are impermanent, they are no better than illusions, dreams and mental
concoctions.
This verse describes the entanglement of material existence. In material existence, the living entity
possesses many things--the material body, children, wife and so on (dehapatya-kalatradisu). One may
think that these will give him protection, but that is impossible. In spite of all these possessions, the spirit
soul has to give up his present situation and accept another. The next situation may be unfavorable, but
even if it is favorable, one must give it up and again accept another body. In this way, one's tribulation in
material existence continues. A sane man should he perfectly aware that these things will never be able to
give him happiness. One must be situated in his spiritual identity and eternally serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as a devotee. Angira Rsi and Narada Muni gave this instruction to Maharaja
Citraketu.

These visible objects like wife, children and property are like dreams and mental concoctions. Actually
what we see has no permanent existence. It is sometimes seen and sometimes not. Only because of our
past actions do we create such mental concoctions, and because of these concoctions, we perform further
activities.
Everything material is a mental concoction because it is sometimes visible and sometimes not. At night
when we dream of tigers and snakes, they are not actually present, but we are afraid because we are
affected by what we envision in our dreams. Everything material is like a dream because it actually has no
permanent existence.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes as follows in his commentary: arthena vyaghra-sarpadina
vinaiva drsyamanah svapnadi-bhange sati na drsyante tad evam daradayo 'vastava-vastu-bhutah
svapnadayo 'vastu-bhutas ca sarve manobhavah mano-vasana janyatvan manobhavah. At night one
dreams of tigers and snakes, and while dreaming he actually sees them, but as soon as the dream is broken
they no longer exist. Similarly, the material world is a creation of our mental concoctions. We have come
to this material world to enjoy material resources, and by mental concoction we discover many, many
objects of enjoyment because our minds are absorbed in material things. This is why we receive various
bodies. According to our mental concoctions we work in various ways, desiring various achievements,
and by nature and the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (karmana-daiva-netrena) we get the
advantages we desire. Thus we become more and more involved with material concoctions. This is the
reason for our suffering in the material world. By one kind of activity we create another, and they are all
products of our mental concoctions.

The living entity in the bodily conception of life is absorbed in the body, which is a combination of the
physical elements, the five senses for gathering knowledge, and the five senses of action, along with the
mind. Through the mind the living entity suffers three kinds of tribulations--adhibhautika, adhidaivika
and adhyatmika. Therefore this body is a source of all miseries.
In the Fifth Canto (5.5.4), while instructing his sons, Rsabhadeva said, asann api klesada asa dehah: the
body, although temporary, is the cause of all the miseries of material existence. As already discussed in
the previous verse, the entire material creation is based on mental concoction. The mind sometimes
induces us to think that if we purchase an automobile we can enjoy the physical elements, such as earth,
water, air and fire, combined in forms of iron, plastic, petrol and so on. Working with the five material
elements (panca-bhutas), as well as with our five knowledge-gathering senses like the eyes, ears and
tongue and our five active senses like the hands and legs, we become involved in the material condition.
Thus we are subjected to the tribulations known as adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika. The mind
is the center because the mind creates all these things. As soon as the material object is struck, however,
the mind is affected, and we suffer. For example, with the material elements, the working senses and the
knowledge-gathering senses we create a very nice car, and when the car is accidentally smashed in a
collision, the mind suffers, and through the mind the living entity suffers.
The fact is that the living entity, while concocting with the mind, creates the material condition.
Because matter is destructible, through the material condition the living entity suffers. Otherwise, the
living entity is detached from all material conditions. When one comes to the Brahman platform, the
platform of spiritual life, fully understanding that he is a spiritual soul (aham brahmasmi), he is no longer
affected by lamentation or hankering. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully
joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything." Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah-sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entity is actually
part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is unaffected by material conditions, but
because the mind (manah) is affected, the senses are affected, and the living entity struggles for existence
within this material world.

Therefore, O King Citraketu, carefully consider the position of the atma. In other words, try to
understand who you are--whether body, mind or soul. Consider where you have come from, where you
are going after giving up this body, and why you are under the control of material lamentation. Try to
understand your real position in this way, and then you will be able to give up your unnecessary
attachment. You will also be able to give up the belief that this material world, or anything not directly in
touch with service to Krsna, is eternal. Thus you will obtain peace.
The Krsna consciousness movement is factually endeavoring to bring human society to a sober
condition. Because of a misdirected civilization, people are jumping in materialistic life like cats and dogs,
performing all sorts of abominable, sinful actions and becoming increasingly entangled. The Krsna
consciousness movement includes self-realization because one is first directed by Lord Krsna to
understand that one is not the body but the owner of the body. When one understands this simple fact, he
can direct himself toward the goal of life. Because people are not educated in terms of the goal of life, they
are working like madmen and becoming more and more attached to the material atmosphere. The
misguided man accepts the material condition as everlasting. One must give up his faith in material things
and give up attachment for them. Then one will be sober and peaceful.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Saints Narada and Angira Instruct King Citraketu."
Chapter Sixteen
King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord
As related in this chapter, Citraketu was able to talk with his dead son and hear from him the truth of
life. When Citraketu was appeased, the great sage Narada gave him a mantra, and by chanting this mantra
Citraketu found shelter at the lotus feet of Sankarsana.
The living entity is eternal. Thus he has neither birth nor death (na hanyate hanyamane sarire).
According to the reactions of one's fruitive activities, one takes birth in various species of life among the
birds, beasts, trees, human beings, demigods and so on, thus rotating through various bodies. For a
certain period of time, one receives a particular type of body as a son or father in a false relationship. All
our relationships in this material world with friends, relatives or enemies consist of duality, in which one
feels happy and distressed on the basis of illusion. The living entity is actually a spiritual soul who is part
and parcel of God and has nothing to do with relationships in the world of duality. Therefore Narada
Muni advised Citraketu not to lament for his so-called dead son.
After hearing instructions from their dead child, Citraketu and his wife could understand that all
relationships in this material world are causes of misery. The queens who had administered poison to the
son of Krtadyuti were very much ashamed. They atoned for the sinful act of killing a child and gave up
their aspiration to have sons. Thereafter. Narada Muni chanted prayers to Narayana, who exists as caturvyuha,
and instructed Citraketu about the Supreme Lord, who creates, maintains and annihilates
everything and who is the master of the material nature. After instructing King Citraketu in this way, he
returned to Brahmaloka. These instructions about the Absolute Truth are called the maha-vidya. After
being initiated by Narada Muni, King Citraketu chanted the maha-vidya, and after one week he attained
the presence of Lord Sankarsana, who was surrounded by the four Kumaras. The Lord was nicely dressed
in bluish garments, with a helmet and ornaments of gold. His face appeared very happy. In the presence of
Lord Sankarsana, Citraketu offered his obeisances and began to offer prayers.
In his prayers, Citraketu said that millions of universes rest in the pores of Sankarsana, who is limitless,
having no beginning and end. The Lord is well known to the devotees for His eternity. The difference
between worshiping the Lord and worshiping the demigods is that the worshiper of the Lord also
becomes eternal, whereas whatever benedictions one can get from the demigods are impermanent. Unless
one becomes a devotee, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
After Citraketu finished his prayers, the unlimited Supreme Lord explained knowledge of Himself to
Citraketu.

jiva uvaca

bhramyamanasya--who am wandering; deva-tiryak--of the demigods and the lower animals; nr--and of the
human species; yonisu--in the wombs.
By the mystic power of Narada Muni, the living entity reentered his dead body for a short time and
spoke in reply to Narada Muni's request. He said: According to the results of my fruitive activities, I, the
living being, transmigrate from one body to another, sometimes going to the species of the demigods,
sometimes to the species of lower animals, sometimes among the vegetables, and sometimes to the human
species. Therefore, in which birth were these my mother and father? No one is actually my mother and
father. How can I accept these two people as my parents?
Here it is made clear that the living being enters a material body that is like a machine created by the
five gross elements of material nature (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the three subtle elements (mind,
intelligence and ego). As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, there are two separate identities, called the inferior
and superior natures, which both belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to the results
of a living entity's fruitive actions, he is forced to enter the material elements in different types of bodies.
This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Maharaja Citraketu and Queen
Krtadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen.
Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to
enter various bodies. The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his
material father and mother. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through
different bodies. The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its
so-called creators. Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Maharaja Citraketu and his wife were his
father and mother.

In this material world, which advances like a river that carries away the living entity, all people become
friends, relatives and enemies in due course of time. They also act neutrally, they mediate, they despise
one another, and they act in many other relationships. Nonetheless, despite these various transactions, no
one is permanently related.
It is our practical experience in this material world that the same person who is one's friend today
becomes one's enemy tomorrow. Our relationships as friends or enemies, family men or outsiders, are
actually the results of our different dealings. Citraketu Maharaja was lamenting for his son, who was now
dead, but he could have considered the situation otherwise. "This living entity," he could have thought,
"was my enemy in my last life, and now, having appeared as my son, he is prematurely leaving just to give
me pain and agony." Why should he not consider his dead son his former enemy and instead of lamenting
be jubilant because of an enemy's death? As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27), prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih
karmani sarvasah: factually everything is happening because of our association with the modes of material
nature. Therefore one who is my friend today in association with the mode of goodness may be my enemy
tomorrow in association with the modes of passion and ignorance. As the modes of material nature work,
in illusion we accept others as friends, enemies, sons or fathers in terms of the reactions of different
dealings under different conditions.

Just as gold and other commodities are continually transferred from one place to another in due course
of purchase and sale, so the living entity, as a result of his fruitive activities, wanders throughout the
entire universe, being injected into various bodies in different species of life by one kind of father after
another.
It has already been explained that Citraketu's son was his enemy in a past life and had now appeared as
his son just to give him more severe pain. Indeed, the untimely death of the son caused severe
lamentation for the father. One may put forward the argument, "If the King's son was his enemy, how
could the King have so much affection for him?" In answer, the example is given that when someone's
wealth falls into the bands of his enemy, the money becomes the enemy's friend. Then the enemy can use
it for his own purposes. Indeed, he can even use it to harm its previous owner. Therefore the money
belongs neither to the one party nor to the other. The money is always money, but in different situations
it can be used as an enemy or a friend.
As explained in Bhagavad-gita, it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is given his birth.
The living entity is a completely separate identity from the so-called father and mother. By the laws of
nature, the living entity is forced to enter the semen of a father and be injected into the womb of the
mother. He is not in control of selecting what kind of father he will accept. prakrteh kriyamanani: the
laws of nature force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just like a consumer commodity that is
purchased and sold. Therefore the so-called relationship of father and son is an arrangement of prakrti, or
nature. It has no meaning, and therefore it is called illusion.
The same living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father and mother and sometimes a human
father and mother. Sometimes he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes he accepts
a demigod father and mother. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
Harassed life after life by the laws of nature, the living entity wanders throughout the entire universe in
different planets and different species of life. Somehow or other, if he is fortunate enough, he comes in
touch with a devotee who reforms his entire life. Then the living entity goes back home, back to Godhead.
Therefore it is said:
janame janame sabe pita mata paya
krsna
guru nahi mile baja hari ei
In the transmigration of the soul through different bodies, everyone, in every form of life--be it human,
animal, tree or demigod--gets a father and mother. This is not very difficult. The difficulty is to obtain a
bona fide spiritual master and Krsna. Therefore the duty of a human being is to capture the opportunity to
come in touch with Krsna's representative, the bona fide spiritual master. Under the guidance of the
spiritual master, the spiritual father, one can return home, back to Godhead.

A few living entities are born in the human species, and others are born as animals. Although both are
living entities, their relationships are impermanent. An animal may remain in the custody of a human
being for some time, and then the same animal may be transferred to the possession of other human
beings. As soon as the animal goes away, the former proprietor no longer has a sense of ownership. As
long as the animal is in his possession he certainly has an affinity for it, but as soon as the animal is sold,
the affinity is lost.
Aside from the fact that the soul transmigrates from one body to another, even in this life the
relationships between living entities are impermanent, as exemplified in this verse. The son of Citraketu
was named Harsasoka, or "jubilation and lamentation." The living entity is certainly eternal, but because
he is covered by a temporary dress, the body, his eternity is not observed. Dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara: "The embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to
old age." Thus the bodily dress is impermanent. The living entity, however, is permanent. As an animal is
transferred from one owner to another, the living entity who was the son of Citraketu lived as his son for
some time, but as soon as he was transferred to another body, the affectionate relationship was broken. As
stated in the example given in the previous verse, when one has a commodity in his hands he considers it
his, but as soon as it is transferred it becomes someone else's commodity. Then one no longer has a
relationship with it; he has no affection for it, nor does he lament for it.

Even though one living entity becomes connected with another because of a relationship based on
bodies that are perishable, the living entity is eternal. Actually it is the body that is born or lost, not the
living entity. One should not accept that the living entity takes birth or dies. The living being actually has
no relationship with so-called fathers and mothers. As long as he appears as the son of a certain father and
mother as a result of his past fruitive activities, he has a connection with the body given by that father and
mother. Thus he falsely accepts himself as their son and acts affectionately. After he dies, however, the
relationship is finished. Under these circumstances, one should not be falsely involved with jubilation and
lamentation.
When the living entity lives within the material body, he falsely thinks that he is the body, although
actually he is not. His relationship with his body and his so-called father and mother are false, illusory
conceptions. These illusions continue as long as one is not enlightened about the situation of the living
entity.

esah--this living entity; nityah--eternal; avyayah--imperishable; suksmah--very, very fine (not seen by
the material eyes); esah--this living entity; sarva-asrayah--the cause of different types of bodies; sva-drk--
self-effulgent; atma-maya-gunaih--by the Supreme Personality of Godhead's modes of material nature;
visvam--this material world; atmanam--himself; srjate--appears; prabhuh--the master.
The living entity is eternal and imperishable because he actually has no beginning and no end. He never
takes birth or dies. He is the basic principle of all types of bodies, yet he does not belong to the bodily
category. The living being is so sublime that he is equal in quality to the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless,
because he is extremely small, he is prone to be illusioned by the external energy, and thus he creates
various bodies for himself according to his different desires.
In this verse the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda--simultaneous oneness and difference--is described.
The living entity is eternal (nitya) like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the difference is that the
Supreme Lord is the greatest, no one being equal to or greater than Him, whereas the living entity is
suksma, or extremely small. The sastra describes that the magnitude of the living entity is one tenthousandth
the size of the tip of a hair. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading (andantara-stha-paramanucayantara-
stham). Relatively, if the living entity is accepted as the smallest, there should naturally be
inquiry about the greatest. The greatest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the smallest is the
living entity.
Another peculiar characteristic of the jiva is that he becomes covered by maya. Atmamaya-gunaih: he is
prone to being covered by the Supreme Lord's illusory energy. The living entity is responsible for his
conditional life in the material world, and therefore he is described as prabhu ("the master"). If he likes he
can come to this material world, and if he likes he can return home, back to Godhead. Because he wanted
to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave him a material body through the
agency of the material energy. As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." The Supreme Lord gives the
living entity a chance to enjoy in this material world as he desires, but He openly expresses His own desire
that the living entity give up all material aspirations, fully surrender unto Him and return home, back to
Godhead.
The living entity is the smallest (suksma). Jiva Gosvami says in this connection that the living entity
within the body is extremely difficult for materialistic scientists to find, although we understand from
authorities that the living entity is within the body. The body is different from the living entity.

For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable. He makes no distinction between that
which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is
not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers. He is only an observer, a witness,
of the different qualities of men.
As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (suksma) whereas the
Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great. For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives,
for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned
souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied
with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):
samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in
devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend,
but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in
the Gita (16.19) the Lord says:
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward
those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their
enemies. For example, to protect Prahlada Maharaja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hiranyakasipu,
although Hiranyakasipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the
witness of everyone's activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined
to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the
results of one's sinful or pious actions.

nadatta atma hi gunam
na dosam na kriya-phalam
udasinavad asinah
paravara-drg isvarah
na--not; adatte--accepts; atma--the Supreme Lord; hi--indeed; gunam--happiness; na--not; dosam--
unhappiness; na--nor; kriya-phalam--the result of any fruitive activity; udasina-vat--exactly like a neutral
man; asinah--sitting (in the core of the heart); para-avara-drk--seeing the cause and effect; isvarah--the
Supreme Lord.
The Supreme Lord [atma], the creator of cause and effect, does not accept the happiness and distress
that result from fruitive actions. He is completely independent of having to accept a material body, and
because He has no material body, He is always neutral. The living entities, being part and parcel of the
Lord, possess His qualities in a minute quantity. Therefore one should not be affected by lamentation.
The conditioned soul has friends and enemies. He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his
position. The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental. Because He is the isvara, the supreme
controller, He is not affected by duality. It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone's
heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one's activities, good and bad. We should also
understand that udasina, neutral, does not mean that He takes no action. Rather, it means that He is not
personally affected. For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him,
but he still takes action as the case warrants. To become completely neutral, indifferent, to material
activities, we should simply seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme neutral person.
Maharaja Citraketu was advised that remaining neutral in such trying circumstances as the death of
one's son is impossible. Nevertheless, since the Lord knows how to adjust everything, the best course is to
depend upon Him and do one's duty in devotional service to the Lord. In all circumstances, one should be
undisturbed by duality. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.47):
karmany evadhikaras te
ma phalesu kadacana
ma karma-phala-hetur bhur
ma te sango 'stv akarmani
"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never
consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your
duty." One should execute one's devotional duty, and for the results of one's actions one should depend
upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

son had spoken in this way and then left, Citraketu and the other relatives of the dead son were all
astonished. Thus they cut off the shackles of their affection, which was due to their relationship with him,
and gave up their lamentation.

dvija-bhasitam--the statement given by the brahmana.
Queen Krtyadyuti's co-wives, who had poisoned the child, were very much ashamed, and they lost all
their bodily luster. While lamenting, O King, they remembered the instructions of Angira and gave up
their ambition to bear children. Following the directions of the brahmanas, they went to the bank of the
Yamuna, where they bathed and atoned for their sinful activities.
In this verse the word bala-hatya-hata-prabhah is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing
children has existed in human society for a long time--since time immemorial--but in the days of yore it
was very rarely performed. At the present moment, however, in this age of Kali, abortion--killing of the
child within the womb--has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a
woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (bala-hatya-hataprabhah).
It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison
to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the brahmanas, they had to
undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful
act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances, the women responsible
must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should
refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Krsna
consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra without offenses, all of one's
sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is
an offense.

[Narada gave Citraketu the following mantra.] O Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, who are
addressed by the omkara [pranava], I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. O Lord Vasudeva, I
meditate upon You. O Lord Pradyumna, Lord Aniruddha and Lord Sankarsana, I offer You my respectful
obeisances. O reservoir of spiritual potency, O supreme bliss, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You,
who are self-sufficient and most peaceful. O ultimate truth, one without a second, You are realized as
Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan and are therefore the reservoir of all knowledge. I offer my respectful
obeisances unto You.
In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He is pranavah sama-vedesu, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras. In
transcendental knowledge, the Lord is addressed as pranava, omkara, which is a symbolic representation
of the Lord in sound. Om namo bhagavate vasudevaya. Vasudeva, who is an expansion of Narayana,
expands Himself as Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarsana. From Sankarsana comes a second Narayana
expansion, and from this Narayana come further expansions of Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Sankarsana and
Aniruddha. The Sankarsana in this group is the original cause of the three purusas, namely
Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu. Ksirodakasayi Visnu is situated in
every universe in a special planet called Svetadvipa. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita: andantarastha.
The word anda means this universe. Within this universe is a planet called Svetadvipa, where
Ksirodakasayi Visnu is situated. From Him come all the incarnations within this universe.
As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita, all these forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are advaita,
nondifferent, and they are also acyuta, infallible; they do not fall down like the conditioned souls. The
ordinary living entity is prone to falling into the clutches of maya, but the Supreme Lord in His different
incarnations and forms is acyuta, infallible. Therefore His body is different from the material body
possessed by the conditioned soul.
The word matra is explained in the Medini dictionary as follows: matra karna-vibhusayam vitte mane
paricchade. The word matra, in its different imports, is used to indicate the decoration of the ear,
possession, respect, and the possession of a covering. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." In the
conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the
summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires. However, because
the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering. The idea that Krsna's body is like
ours--in other words, that His body and soul are different--is a misunderstanding. There are no such
differences for Krsna, because His body is full of knowledge. Here we receive material bodies because of a
lack of knowledge, but because Krsna, Vasudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His
body and His soul. Krsna remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary
being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday. This is the difference between Krsna's body
and our body. Therefore the Lord is addressed as vijnana-matraya paramananda-murtaye.
Because the Lord's body is full of knowledge, He always enjoys transcendental bliss. Indeed, His very
form is paramananda. This is confirmed in the Vedanta-sutra: anandamayo'bhyasat. By nature the Lord is
anandamaya. Whenever we see Krsna, He is always full of ananda in all circumstances. No one can make
Him morose. Atmaramaya: He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is selfsufficient.
Santaya: He has no anxiety. One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of
anxiety. Karmis, jnanis and yogis are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not
want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful.
Nivrtta-dvaita-drstaye: in our conditioned life our bodies have different parts, but although Krsna
apparently has different bodily parts, no part of His body is different from any other part. Krsna can see
with His eyes, and Krsna can see without His eyes. Therefore in the Svetasvatara Upanisad it is said,
pasyaty acaksuh. He can see with His hands and legs. He does not need a particular bodily part to perform
a particular action. Angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti: He can do anything He desires with any part of
His body, and therefore He is called almighty.

Perceiving Your personal bliss, You are always transcendental to the waves of material nature.
Therefore, my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the supreme controller of the
senses, and Your expansions of form are unlimited. You are the greatest, and therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto You.
This verse analytically differentiates the living entity from the Supreme Lord. The form of the Lord and
the form of the conditioned soul are different because the Lord is always blissful whereas the conditioned
soul is always under the threefold miseries of the material world. The Supreme Lord is sac-cid-anandavigraha.
He derives ananda, bliss, from His own self. The Lord's body is transcendental, spiritual, but
because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles. The
conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always
free from such dualities. The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is
controlled by the senses. The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest. The living
entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all
actions and reactions. The expansions of the Supreme Lord's body are innumerable (advaitam acyutam
anadim ananta-rupam), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form. From history we learn that a
conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord's bodily
expansions are unlimited. This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no
beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities.

As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living
force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when
infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As iron cannot burn
unless heated by fire, the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Brahman.
Red-hot iron can burn, but it cannot burn the original fire. Therefore the consciousness of the small
particle of Brahman is fully dependent on the power of the Supreme Brahman. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord
says, mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "From Me the conditioned soul receives memory, knowledge
and forgetfulness." The power for activities comes from the Supreme Lord, and when the Lord withdraws
this power, the conditioned soul no longer has energy with which to act through his various senses. The
body includes five knowledge-acquiring senses, five active senses and the mind, but actually these are
merely lumps of matter. For example, the brain is nothing but matter, but when electrified by the energy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the brain can act, just as iron can burn when made red-hot by the
influence of fire. The brain can act while we are awake or even while we are dreaming, but when we are
fast asleep or unconscious the brain is inactive. Since the brain is a lump of matter, it does not have
independent power with which to act. It can act only when favored by the influence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is Brahman or Parabrahman. This is the way to understand how the
Supreme Brahman, Krsna, is present everywhere, just as the sunshine is present because of the sun-god in
the sun globe. The Supreme Lord is called Hrsikesa; He is the only conductor of the senses. Unless
empowered by His energy, our senses cannot act. In other words, He is the only seer, the only worker, the
only listener, and the only active principle or supreme controller.

It is said that the Absolute Truth is one, but is manifested in different features as Brahman, Paramatma
and Bhagavan. The previous verses described the Brahman and Paramatma features of the Absolute Truth.
Now this prayer is offered in bhakti-yoga to the Absolute Supreme Person. The words used in this regard
are sakala-satvata-parivrdha. The word satvata means "devotees," and sakala means "all together." The
devotees, who also have lotus feet, serve the lotus feet of the Lord with their lotus hands. The devotees
may sometimes not be competent to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is addressed
as parama-paramesthin. He is the Supreme Person, yet He is very kind to the devotees. No one is
competent to serve the Lord, but even if a devotee is not competent, the merciful Lord accepts the humble
attempt of the devotee.

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Narada, having become the spiritual master of Citraketu, instructed
him fully in this prayer because Citraketu was fully surrendered. O King Pariksit, Narada then left with
the great sage Angira for the topmost planet, known as Brahmaloka.
When Angira had first come to visit King Citraketu, he did not bring Narada with him. However, after
the death of Citraketu's son, Angira brought Narada to instruct King Citraketu about bhakti-yoga. The
difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the
death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of
renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions. It is
only at this stage that bhakti-yoga can be instructed. As long as one is attached to material enjoyment,
bhakti-yoga cannot be understood. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.44):
bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam
tayapahrta-cetasam
vyavasayatmika buddhih
samadhau na vidhiyate
"In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are
bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not
take place." As long as one is very much attached to material enjoyment, one cannot concentrate his mind
on the subject matter of devotional service.
The Krsna consciousness movement is progressing successfully in the Western countries at the present
moment because the youth in the West have reached the stage of vairagya, or renunciation. They are
practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of
hippies throughout the Western countries. Now if these young people are instructed about bhakti-yoga,
Krsna consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective.
As soon as Citraketu understood the philosophy of vairagya-vidya, the knowledge of renunciation, he
could understand the process of bhakti-yoga. In this regard Srila Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya has said,
vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga. Vairagya-vidya and bhakti-yoga are parallel lines. One is essential for
understanding the other. It is also said, bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag. 11.2.42).
Advancement in devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of
material enjoyment. Narada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow
causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, Angira brought Narada Muni to instruct the King. These
instructions were extremely effective. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Narada Muni is certainly a
pure devotee.

O King Pariksit, after only one week of repeatedly practicing the mantra received from the spiritual
master, Citraketu achieved the rule of the planet of the Vidyadharas as an intermediate product of his
spiritual advancement in knowledge.
If a devotee, after being initiated, adheres rigidly to the instructions of the spiritual master, he is
naturally endowed with the material opulences of vidyadhara-adhipatyam and similar posts as byproducts.
A devotee need not practice yoga, karma or jnana to achieve a successful result. Devotional
service alone is competent to award a devotee all material power. A pure devotee, however, is never
attached to material power, although he gets it very easily without personal endeavor. Citraketu received
this side benefit of his devotional service, which he rigidly performed in accordance with the instructions
of Narada.

tatah--thereafter; katipaya-ahobhih--within a few days; vidyaya--by the spiritual mantra; iddha-manahgatih--
the course of his mind being enlightened; jagama--went; deva-devasya--of the master of all other
lords or demigods; sesasya--Lord Sesa; carana-antikam--to the shelter of the lotus feet.
Thereafter, within a very few days, by the influence of the mantra that Citraketu had practiced, his mind
became increasingly enlightened in spiritual progress, and he attained shelter at the lotus feet of
Anantadeva.
A devotee's ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets
in the spiritual sky. As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material
opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does
the Supreme Lord award them. When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord,
his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual. For example, if a devotee spends
money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual
(nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate). A devotee's mind is never diverted to the
material side of the temple. The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are
spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of
devotional service. Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual. Consequently a
devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement. This opulence is an aid to help
the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom. Thus Maharaja Citraketu remained in material
opulence as a vidyadhara-pati, master of the Vidyadharas, and by executing devotional service he became
perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of
Lord Sesa, Ananta.
A karmi's material opulence and a devotee's material opulence are not on the same level. Srila
Madhvacarya comments in this way:
anyantaryaminam visnum
upasyanya-samipagah
bhaved yogyataya tasya
padam va prapnuyan narah
By worshiping Lord Visnu one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Visnu
for any material profit. Instead he serves Lord Visnu without material desires and is therefore ultimately
transferred to the spiritual kingdom. In this regard, Srila Viraraghava Acarya comments, yathesta-gatir ity
arthah: by worshiping Visnu, a devotee can get whatever he likes. Maharaja Citraketu wanted only to
return home, back to Godhead, and therefore he achieved success in that way.

brilliantly glittering helmet, armlets, belt and bangles. His face was smiling, and His eyes were reddish. He
was surrounded by such exalted liberated persons as Sanat-kumara.

As soon as Maharaja Citraketu saw the Supreme Lord, he was cleansed of all material contamination and
situated in his original Krsna consciousness, being completely purified. He became silent and grave, and
because of love for the Lord, tears fell from his eyes, and his hairs stood on end. With great devotion and
love, he offered his respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead.
The word tad-darsana-dhvasta-samasta-kilbisah is very important in this verse. If one regularly sees the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple, one will gradually be disinfected of all material desires
simply by visiting the temple and seeing the Deity. When one is freed from all the results of sinful
activities, one will be purified, and with a healthy mind, completely cleansed, he will increasingly make
progress in Krsna consciousness.

With tears of love and affection, Citraketu repeatedly moistened the resting place of the Supreme Lord's
lotus feet. Because his voice was choked in ecstasy, for a considerable time he was unable to utter any of
the letters of the alphabet to offer the Lord suitable prayers.
All the letters of the alphabet and the words constructed by those letters are meant for offering prayers
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maharaja Citraketu had the opportunity to offer prayers to the
Lord by composing nice verses from the letters of the alphabet, but because of his ecstasy, for a
considerable time he could not join those letters to offer prayers to the Lord. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.5.22):

If one has scientific, philosophical, political, economic or any other abilities and wants perfection in his
knowledge, he should offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by composing first-class
poetry or engaging his talents in the service of the Lord. Citraketu wanted to do this, but he was unable

Thereafter, by controlling his mind with his intelligence and thus restricting his senses from external

prayers to the Lord, who is the personification of the holy scriptures [the satvata-samhitas like the
Brahma-samhita and the Narada-pancaratra] and who is the spiritual master of all. He offered his prayers
as follows.
One cannot offer prayers to the Lord with mundane words. One must become spiritually advanced by
controlling the mind and senses. Then he can find suitable words to offer in prayers to the Lord. Quoting
the following verse from the Padma Purana, Srila Sanatana Gosvami forbids us to sing any song not sung
by authorized devotees.

The words or songs of a person not fixed in Vaisnava behavior, not strictly following the rules and
regulations and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra should not be accepted by pure devotees. The words
satvata-sastra-vigraham indicate that the sac-cid-ananda body of the Lord can never be accepted to be
made of maya. Devotees do not offer prayers to the Lord in an imaginary form. The existence of the Lord's
form is supported by all Vedic literature.

jita-atmabhih--who have completely controlled the senses; bhavata--by You; vijitah--conquered; te--they;
api--also; ca--and; bhajatam--to those who always engage in Your service; akama-atmanam--with no
motives for material profit; yah--who; atma-dah--giving Yourself; ati-karunah--extremely merciful.
Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly
conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control
because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give
Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.
The Lord and the devotees both conquer. The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are
conquered by the Lord. Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss
from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by Krsna and the
gopis. The gopis conquered Krsna, and Krsna conquered the gopis. Thus whenever Krsna played His flute,
He conquered the minds of the gopis, and without seeing the gopis Krsna could not be happy. Other
transcendentalists, such as jnanis and yogis, cannot conquer the Supreme personality of Godhead; only
pure devotees can conquer Him.
Pure devotees are described as sama-mati, which means that they never deviate from devotional service
under any circumstances. It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they
worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional
service. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam says that devotional service is ahaituky apratihata, unmotivated
and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive
(anyabhilasita-sunyam), his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (apratihata). Thus a
devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the jnanis and yogis, is
that jnanis and yogis artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for
such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the
Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called sama-mati or jitatma. They detest
oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from
all material hankering. Therefore they are called niskama, desireless. A living entity cannot exist without
desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called kama, lusty desires. Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah:
because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer
the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord.
Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being
free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers
them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord.
Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord.
The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for
material profit, naturally He is conquered.
Devotees are always engaged in service.
sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor
vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane
All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Because of such devotion, the
Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire. Of course,
devotees have no purpose other than to serve. When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for
material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord
when conquered by His devotees.

tatra--in that; mrsa--in vain; spardhanti--rival one another; prthak--of separateness; abhimatya--by a false

My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your
opulences. Since Lord Brahma and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You,
their partial power to create does not make them God [isvara]. Their consciousness of themselves as
separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.
A devotee who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord knows very well that the creative
energy of the living entities, from Lord Brahma down to the small ant, exists because the living entities are
part and parcel of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says, mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah
sanatanah: "The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts." The living
entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire. Because they are
part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity.
The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern
facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products. The first
consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme
Lord, who says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "From Me comes
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the
core of every living entity's heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative
faculties comes from Him. Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like
airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists. Before the airplane was created, its
ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the
manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators.
Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles. The ingredients for these cars are
supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied
by the Lord. Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem
of what to do with their ingredients. The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of
Godhead. Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and
later the creation again becomes a problem. Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the
act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is rightly stated herein that
the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord,
not to the living entities.

You exist in the beginning, middle and end of everything, from the most minute particle of the cosmic

having no beginning, end or middle. You are perceived to exist in these three phases, and thus You are
permanent. When the cosmic manifestation does not exist, You exist as the original potency.
The Brahma-samhita (5.33) says:
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Krsna], who is the original person--absolute,
infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest,
and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord
cannot be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed
devotees." The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no cause, for He is the cause of everything. The Lord
is beyond the workings of cause and effect. He is eternally existing. In another verse the Brahma-samhita
says, andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: the Lord exists within the gigantic universe and within
the atom. The descent of the Lord into the atom and the universe indicates that without His presence,
nothing could factually exist. Scientists say that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when
they see a vast ocean they are puzzled about where such a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen could have
come from. They think that everything evolved from chemicals, but where did the chemicals come from?
That they do not know. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, He can
produce immense quantities of chemicals to create a situation for chemical evolution. We actually see that
chemicals are produced from living entities. For example, a lemon tree produces many tons of citric acid.
The citric acid is not the cause of the tree; rather, the tree is the cause of the acid. Similarly, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the cause of everything. He is the cause of the tree that produces the citric acid
(bijam mam sarva-bhutanam). Devotees can see that the original potencies causing the cosmic
manifestation are not in chemicals but in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is the cause of the
chemicals.
Everything is caused or manifested by the energy of the Supreme Lord, and when everything is
annihilated or dissolved, the original potency enters the body of the Supreme Lord. Therefore this verse
says, adav ante 'pi ca sattvanam yad dhruvam tad evantarale 'pi. The word dhruvam means "permanent."
The permanent reality is Krsna, not this cosmic manifestation. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, aham adir hi
devanam and mattah sarvam pravartate: Krsna is the original cause of everything. Arjuna recognized Lord
Sri Krsna as the original person (purusam sasvatam divyam adi-devam ajam vibhum), and the Brahmasamhita
describes Him as the original person (govindam adi-purusam). He is the cause of all causes,
whether at the beginning, at the end or in the middle.

they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited
[ananta].
The Brahma-samhita (5.48) says:
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
The origin of the material creation is Maha-Visnu, who lies in the Causal Ocean. While He sleeps in that
ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales.
This Maha-Visnu is a plenary portion of a portion of Visnu, Govinda (yasya kala-visesah). The word kala
refers to a plenary portion of a plenary portion. From Krsna, or Govinda, comes Balarama; from Balarama
comes Sankarsana; from Sankarsana, Narayana; from Narayana, the second Sankarsana; from the second
Sankarsana, Maha-Visnu; from Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu; and from Garbhodakasayi Visnu,
Ksirodakasayi Visnu. Ksirodakasayi Visnu controls every universe. This gives an idea of the meaning of
ananta, unlimited. What is to be said of the unlimited potency and existence of the Lord? This verse
describes the coverings of the universe (saptabhir dasa-gunottarair anda-kosah). The first covering is
earth, the second is water, the third is fire, the fourth is air, the fifth is sky, the sixth is the total material
energy, and the seventh is the false ego. Beginning with the covering of earth, each covering is ten times
greater than the previous one. Thus we can only imagine how great each universe is, and there are many
millions of universes. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.42):
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I
pervade and support this entire universe." The entire material world manifests only one fourth of the
Supreme Lord's energy. Therefore He is called ananta.

they fail to worship Your Lordship, and instead they worship the insignificant demigods, who are but
small sparks of Your glory. With the destruction of the entire universe, including the demigods, the
benedictions received from the demigods also vanish, just like the nobility when a king is no longer in

Bhagavad-gita (7.20) says, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah: "Those whose minds
are distorted by material desires surrender unto the demigods." Similarly, this verse condemns worship of
the demigods. We may show our respect to the demigods, but the demigods are not worshipable. The
intelligence of those who worship the demigods is lost (hrta jnanah) because these worshipers do not
know that when the entire material cosmic manifestation is annihilated, the demigods, who are the
departmental heads of that manifestation, will be vanquished. When the demigods are vanquished, the
benedictions given by the demigods to unintelligent men will also be vanquished. Therefore a devotee
should not hanker to obtain material opulence by worshiping the demigods, but should engage in the

"Whether full of all material desires, free from material desires or desiring liberation, a person who has
broader intelligence must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead." (Bhag.
2.3.10) This is the duty of a perfect human being. One who has the shape of a human being but whose
actions are nothing but those of an animal is called nara-pasu or dvipada-pasu, a two-legged animal. A
human being who is not interested in Krsna consciousness is condemned herewith as a nara-pasu.

kama-dhiyas tvayi racita
na parama rohanti yatha karambha-bijani
jnanatmany agunamaye
guna-ganato 'sya dvandva-jalani
kama-dhiyah--desires for sense gratification; tvayi--in You; racitah--performed; na--not; parama--O
Supreme Personality of Godhead; rohanti--do grow (produce other bodies); yatha--just as; karambhabijani--
sterilized or fried seeds; jnana-atmani--in You, whose existence is in full knowledge; aguna-maye--
who is not affected by the material qualities; guna-ganatah--from the material qualities; asya--of a person;
dvandva-jalani--the networks of duality.
O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material
opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities,
they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants. Living
entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature,
but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the
conditions of material nature.
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), wherein the Lord says:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." If one simply
engages in Krsna consciousness to understand Krsna, he surely becomes immune to the process of
repeated birth and death. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: such a
person, simply by engaging in Krsna consciousness or understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, becomes quite fit to return home, back to Godhead. Even those who are obsessed with
material desires may also come to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so steadily that they go
back to Godhead. The fact is that if one comes to Krsna consciousness, although he may have many
material desires, he becomes increasingly attracted to the lotus feet of Krsna through associating with the
Supreme Lord by chanting His holy name. The Supreme Lord and His holy name are identical. Thus he
becomes uninterested in attachment to material enjoyment. The perfection of life is to be uninterested in
material enjoyment and interested in Krsna. If one comes to Krsna consciousness somehow or other, even
for material gain, the result is that he will be liberated. Kamad dvesad bhayat snehat. Whether for the
satisfaction of material desires, because of the influence of envy, because of fear, because of affection or
because of any other reason, if one comes to Krsna, his life is successful.

O unconquerable one, when You spoke about bhagavata-dharma, which is the uncontaminated religious
system for achieving the shelter of Your lotus feet, that was Your victory. Persons who have no material
desires, like the Kumaras, who are self-satisfied sages, worship You to be liberated from material
contamination. In other words, they accept the process of bhagavata-dharma to achieve shelter at Your
lotus feet.
As stated by Srila Rupa Gosvami in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desires for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service."
The Narada-pancaratra also says:
sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam
hrsikena hrsikesasevanam
bhaktir ucyate
"One should be free from all material designations and cleansed of all material contamination. He
should be restored to his pure identity, in which he engages his senses in the service of the proprietor of
the senses. That is called devotional service." This is also called bhagavata-dharma. Without material
aspirations, one should simply serve Krsna, as advised in Bhagavad-gita, Narada-pancaratra and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Bhagavata-dharma is the process of religion enunciated by pure devotees, direct
representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead like Narada, Sukadeva Gosvami and their humble
servants in the disciplic succession. By understanding bhagavata-dharma, one immediately becomes free
from material contamination. Living entities, who are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, are loitering in this material world suffering. When they are instructed by the Lord Himself
about bhagavata-dharma and they adopt it, that is victory for the Lord, for He then reclaims these fallen
souls. A devotee following the principles of bhagavata-dharma feels very much obligated to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He can understand the difference between life without bhagavata-dharma and life
with bhagavata-dharma and thus he ever remains obliged to the Lord. Taking to Krsna consciousness and
bringing fallen souls to Krsna consciousness is victory for Lord Krsna.
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo

"The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving
devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and
uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self." (Bhag. 1.2.6) Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam is the
pure transcendental process of religion.

visama--unequal (your religion, my religion; your belief, my belief); matih--consciousness; na--not;

by this unequal intelligence; racitah--made; yah--that which; sah--that system of religion; hi--
indeed; avisuddhah--not pure; ksayisnuh--temporary; adharma-bahulah--full of irreligion.
Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhagavata-dharma work under conceptions of
fruitive results and distinctions of "you and I" and "yours and mine." The followers of Srimad-
Bhagavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Krsna conscious, thinking that they are Krsna's and
Krsna is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of
enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are
impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.
Bhagavata-dharma has no contradictions. Conceptions of "your religion" and "my religion" are
completely absent from bhagavata-dharma. Bhagavata-dharma means following the orders given by the
Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, as stated in Bhagavad-gita: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja.
God is one, and God is for everyone. Therefore everyone must surrender to God. That is the pure
conception of religion. Whatever God orders constitutes religion (dharmam tu saksad bhagavatpranitam).
In bhagavata-dharma there is no question of "what you believe" and "what I believe."
Everyone must believe in the Supreme Lord and carry out His orders. Anukulyena krsnanusilanam:
whatever Krsna says--whatever God says--should be directly carried out. That is dharma, religion.
If one is actually Krsna conscious, he cannot have any enemies. Since his only engagement is to induce
others to surrender to Krsna, or God, how can he have enemies? If one advocates the Hindu religion, the
Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts. History shows
that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another.
There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon
service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy. There are
many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of "my
belief" and "your belief." Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him. That is bhagavatadharma.
Bhagavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is
connected with Krsna (isavasyam idam sarvam). According to the Vedic injunctions, sarvam khalv idam
brahma: Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. Bhagavata-dharma captures this presence of the
Supreme. Bhagavata-dharma does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything
emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme.
For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we
are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine
in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of sarvam khalv idam brahma. Everything is
Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is mithya, false;
everything is factual.
Bhagavata-dharma is called sarvotkrsta, the best of all religious systems, because those who follow
bhagavata-dharma are not envious of anyone. Pure bhagavatas, pure devotees, invite everyone, without
envy, to join the Krsna consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Suhrdam sarva-bhutanam: he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is
the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who
believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in Krsna consciousness, or bhagavatadharma.
If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure.

giving pain to others; ca--also; tatha--as well as; adharmah--irreligion.
How can a religious system that produces envy of one's self and of others be beneficial for oneself and
for them? What is auspicious about following such a system? What is actually to be gained? By causing
pain to one's own self due to self-envy and by causing pain to others, one arouses Your anger and
practices irreligion.
Any religious system but the process of bhagavata-dharma--service as an eternal servant of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead--is a system of envy of one's own self and of others. For example, there are many
systems of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended. Such animal sacrifices are inauspicious
both for the performer and for the animal. Although one is sometimes permitted to sacrifice an animal
before the goddess Kali and eat it instead of purchasing meat from a slaughterhouse, permission to eat
meat after a sacrifice in the presence of the goddess Kali is not the order of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. It is simply a concession for the miserable person who will not give up eating meat. It is meant
to restrict his desire for unrestricted meat-eating. Such a religious system is condemned. Therefore Krsna
says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other duties and surrender unto
Me." That is the last word in religion.
One may argue that the sacrifice of animals is recommended in the Vedas. This recommendation,
however, is a restriction. Without Vedic restrictions on the purchase of meat, people will purchase meat
from the market, which will be overflooded with meat shops, and slaughterhouses will increase. To
restrict this, sometimes the Vedas say that one may eat meat after sacrificing an insignificant animal like a
goat before the goddess Kali. In any case, a system of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended
is inauspicious for those who perform the sacrifices and for the animals. Envious persons who perform
ostentatious animal sacrifices are condemned in Bhagavad-gita (16.17) as follows:
atma-sambhavitah stabdha
dhana-mana-madanvitah
yajante nama-yajnais te
dambhenavidhi-purvakam
"Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform
sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations." Sometimes animal sacrifices are
performed very gorgeously with grand arrangements for worshiping the goddess Kali, but such festivals,
although performed in the name of yajna, are not actually yajna, for yajna means to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is recommended that in this age specifically, yajnaih sankirtanaprayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who have good intelligence satisfy the yajna-purusa, Visnu, by
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Envious persons, however, are condemned by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as follows:
ahankaram balam darpam
kamam krodham ca samsritah
mam atma-para-dehesu
pradvisanto 'bhyasuyakah
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes
against the real religion. Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast
by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." (Bg. 16.18-19) These
persons are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as indicated by the words tava kopah. A
person who commits murder is envious of himself and also the person he has killed, for the result of
committing murder is that he will be arrested and hanged. If one transgresses the laws of a man-made
government, he may escape being killed by the state, but one cannot escape the laws of God. A killer of
any animal must be killed in his next life by the same animal. This is the law of nature. One must follow
the instructions of the Supreme Lord: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. If one follows
any other system of religion, he is subject to punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in many
different ways. Therefore if one follows a concocted system of religion, he is envious not only of others
but also of himself. Consequently his system of religion is useless.
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8) says:
dharmah svanusthitah pumsam
visvaksena-kathasu yah
notpadayed yadi ratim
srama eva hi kevalam
"Duties (dharma) executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do
not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord." Following a system of religion that does not
awaken one's Krsna consciousness, or God consciousness, is merely a waste of time and labor.

My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita according
to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their
occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving,
and not considering high and low, are called Aryans. Such Aryans worship You, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
Bhagavata-dharma and krsna-katha are identical. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted everyone to become
a guru and preach the instructions of Krsna everywhere from Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, the
Puranas, Vedanta-sutra and similar Vedic literatures. Aryans, who are advanced in civilization, follow
bhagavata-dharma. Prahlada Maharaja, although merely a child of five years, recommended:
kaumara acaret prajno
dharman bhagavatan iha
durlabham manusam janma
tad apy adhruvam arthadam
(Bhag. 7.6.1)
Prahlada Maharaja preached bhagavata-dharma among his classmates as soon as an opportunity was
afforded by the absence of his teachers from the classroom. He said that from the very beginning of life,
from the age of five, children should be instructed about bhagavata-dharma because the human form of
life, which is very rarely obtained, is meant for understanding this subject.
Bhagavata-dharma means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
Bhagavad-gita we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. Again, the Puranas and other Vedic literatures set forth four
asramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore bhagavata-dharma means the varnasramadharma
of the four social and four spiritual divisions.
The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of bhagavata-dharma and live
according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called Aryans or arya. A
civilization of Aryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those
instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and
other living entities. panditah sama-darsinah: because they are completely educated in Krsna
consciousness, they see all living beings equally. Aryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not
to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is
prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also,
all for sense gratification. This is not an Aryan civilization. As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambesv
aprthag-dhiyah. The word aprthag-dhiyah indicates that Aryans do not distinguish between lower and
higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and
plants. This is the basic principle of an Aryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who
have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of brahmanas, ksatriyas,
vaisyas and sudras. The brahmanas should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
as stated in Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be guna and karma. In other
words, one should acquire the qualities of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and act accordingly. This
is the civilization accepted by the Aryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very
much eager to satisfy Krsna. This is perfect civilization.
Aryans do not deviate from the instructions of Krsna, nor do they have doubts about Krsna, but non-
Aryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living
entities. Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden
activities for sense gratification. Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: they deviate in this way because they want to
gratify their senses. They have no other occupation or ambition. Their method of civilization is
condemned in the previous verse. Kah ksemo nija-parayoh kiyan varthah sva-para-druha dharmena:
"What is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others?"
This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the Aryan civilization and accept the
instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should conduct his social, political and religious
affairs according to His instructions. We are spreading the Krsna consciousness movement to try to
establish a society the way that Krsna wants it. This is the meaning of Krsna consciousness. We are
therefore presenting Bhagavad-gita as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction. Fools and
rascals interpret Bhagavad-gita in their own way. When Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto madyaji
mam namaskuru--"Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto
Me"--they comment that it is not Krsna to whom we must surrender. Thus they derive imaginary
meanings from Bhagavad-gita. The Krsna consciousness movement, however, strictly follows bhagavatadharma,
the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam for the complete welfare of human
society. One who misinterprets Bhagavad-gita, twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a
non-Aryan. Therefore commentaries on Bhagavad-gita by such persons should be immediately rejected.
One should try to follow Bhagavad-gita as it is. In Bhagavad-gita (12.6-7) Lord Sri Krsna says:
ye tu sarvani karmani
mayi sannyasya mat-parah
ananyenaiva yogena
mam dhyayanta upasate
tesam aham samuddharta
mrtyu-samsara-sagarat
bhavami na cirat partha
mayy avesita-cetasam
"For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without
deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon
Me, O son of Prtha, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death."

My Lord, it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing
You. Not to speak of seeing You personally, merely by hearing the holy name of Your Lordship only once,
even candalas, men of the lowest class, are freed from all material contamination. Under the
circumstances, who will not be freed from material contamination simply by seeing You?
As stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.5.16), yan-nama-sruti-matrena puman bhavati nirmalah: simply
by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one is immediately purified. Therefore, in this age of Kali, when all
people are very contaminated, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended as the only
means of improvement.
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." (Brhan-naradiya purana)
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu introduced this chanting of the holy name five hundred years ago, and now
through the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement, we are actually seeing that men
who are considered to belong to the lowest class are being delivered from all sinful activities simply by
hearing the holy name of the Lord. Samsara, material existence, is a result of sinful actions. Everyone in
this material world is condemned, yet as there are different grades of prisoners, there are different grades
of men. All of them, in all statuses of life, are suffering. To stop the suffering of material existence, one
must take to the Hare Krsna movement of sankirtana or Krsna conscious life.
Herein it is said, yan-nama sakrc chravanat: the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so
powerful that if once heard without offenses, it can purify the lowest of men (kirata-hunandhra-pulindapulkasah).
Such men, who are called candalas, are less than sudras, but they also can be purified simply
by hearing the holy name of the Lord, not to speak of personally seeing the Lord. From our present
position, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be personally seen as the Deity in the temple. The
Deity of the Lord is not different from the Supreme Lord. Because we cannot see the Supreme Lord with
our present blunt eyes, the Lord has kindly consented to come before us in a form we can see. Therefore
the Deity in the temple should not be considered material. By offering food to the Deity and by decorating
and serving the Deity, one gets the same result that one derives from serving the Lord personally in
Vaikuntha.

This is the process of the perfect way. One must take lessons from authorities like Narada, Vyasa and

manifestation; sthiti--of the maintenance; laya--dissolution; udaya--and creation; isaya--unto the Supreme
Lord; duravasita--impossible to understand; atma-gataye--whose own position; ku-yoginam--of those who

unto the supreme pure.
My dear Lord, You are the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this cosmic manifestation, but persons
who are too materialistic and who always see separateness do not have eyes with which to see You. They
cannot understand Your real position, and therefore they conclude that the cosmic manifestation is
independent of Your opulence. My Lord, You are the supreme pure, and You are full in all six opulences.
Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
Atheistic men think that the cosmic manifestation has come about by chance, by a combination of
matter, without reference to God. Materialistic so-called chemists and atheistic philosophers always try to
avoid even the name of God in relation to the cosmic manifestation. For them God's creation is impossible
to understand because they are too materialistic. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is paramahamsa, or
the supreme pure, whereas those who are sinful, being very much attached to material sense enjoyment
and therefore engaging in material activities like asses, are the lowest of men. All their so-called scientific
knowledge is null and void because of their atheistic temperament. Thus they cannot understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sankarsana, replied; yat--which; naradaangirobhyam--
by the great sages Narada and Angira; te--unto you; vyahrtam--spoken; me--of Me;
anusasanam--the worship; samsiddhah--completely perfected; asi--you are; taya--by that; rajan--O King;
vidyaya--mantra; darsanat--from the direct sight; ca--as well as; me--of Me.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Anantadeva, replied as follows: O King, as a result of your having
accepted the instructions spoken about Me by the great sages Narada and Angira, you have become
completely aware of transcendental knowledge. Because you are now educated in the spiritual science,
you have seen Me face to face. Therefore you are now completely perfect.
The perfection of life is to be spiritually educated and to understand the existence of the Lord and how
He creates, maintains and annihilates the cosmic manifestation. When one is perfect in knowledge, he can
develop his love of Godhead through the association of such perfect persons as Narada and Angira and
the members of their disciplic succession. Then one is able to see the unlimited Supreme Personality of
Godhead face to face. Although the Lord is unlimited, by His causeless mercy He becomes visible to the
devotee, who is then able to see Him. In our present position of conditioned life we cannot see or
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Sri Krsna
through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by
transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord
revealed to him." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234) If one takes to spiritual life under the direction of
Narada Muni or his representative and thus engages himself in the service of the Lord, he qualifies himself
to see the Lord face to face. The Brahma-samhita (5.38) states:
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with
the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara situated within the heart of the devotee."
One must follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Thus one becomes qualified and later sees the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, as evinced by Maharaja Citraketu.

aham vai sarva-bhutani
bhutatma bhuta-bhavanah
sabda-brahma param brahma
mamobhe sasvati tanu
aham--I; vai--indeed; sarva-bhutani--expanded in different forms of living entities; bhuta-atma--the
Supersoul of all living entities (the supreme director and enjoyer of them); bhuta-bhavanah--the cause for
the manifestation of all living entities; sabda-brahma--the transcendental sound vibration (the Hare Krsna
mantra); param brahma--the Supreme Absolute Truth; mama--My; ubhe--both (namely, the form of
sound and the form of spiritual identity); sasvati--eternal; tanu--two bodies.
All living entities, moving and nonmoving, are My expansions and are separate from Me. I am the
Supersoul of all living beings, who exist because I manifest them. I am the form of the transcendental
vibrations like omkara and Hare Krsna Hare Rama, and I am the Supreme Absolute Truth. These two
forms of Mine--namely, the transcendental sound and the eternally blissful spiritual form of the Deity, are
My eternal forms; they are not material.
The science of devotional service has been instructed by Narada and Angira to Citraketu. Now, because
of Citraketu's devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By performing
devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (prema
pumartho mahan) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, when one
engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatam priti-purvakam)n
accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more
pleasing. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone's heart, speaks to
the devotee (dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te). Citraketu Maharaja was first instructed
by his gurus, Angira and Narada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of
seeing the Supreme Lord face to face. Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of
knowledge.
The essence of knowledge is that there are two kinds of vastu, or substances, One is real, and the other,
being illusory or temporary, is sometimes called nonfactual. One must consider these two kinds of
existence. The real tattva, or truth, consists of Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." The Absolute Truth exists eternally in three features. Therefore, Brahman,
Paramatma and Bhagavan combined are the substance.
The categories of emanations from the nonsubstance are two--activities and forbidden activities (karma
and vikarma). Karma refers to the pious life or material activities performed during the day and the
mental activities of dreams at night. These are more or less desired activities. Vikarma, however, refers to
illusory activities, which are something like the will-o'-the-wisp. These are activities that have no
meaning. For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations,
and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in
history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations. Such activities are
called vikarma.
All material activities are actually illusory, and progress in illusion is simply a waste of time. These
illusory activities are called akarya, and one must learn of them from the instructions of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.17):
karmano hy api boddhavyam
boddhavyam ca vikarmanah
akarmanas ca boddhavyam
gahana karmano gatih
"The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action
is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is." One must learn of these directly from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who, as Anantadeva, is instructing King Citraketu because of the advanced stage
of devotional service he achieved by following the instructions of Narada and Angira.
Herein it is said, aham vai sarva-bhutani: the Lord is everything (sarva-bhutani), including the living
entities and the material or physical elements. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My
separated material energies. Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior
energy of Mine, which consists of the living entities, who are struggling with material nature and are
sustaining the universe." The living entity tries to lord it over the material or physical elements, but both
the physical elements and the spiritual spark are energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the Lord says, aham vai sarva-bhutani: "I am everything." Just as heat and light
emanate from fire, these two energies--the physical elements and the living entities--emanate from the
Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord says, aham vai sarva-bhutani: "I expand the physical and spiritual
categories."
Again, the Lord, as the Supersoul, guides the living entities who are conditioned by the physical
atmosphere. Therefore he is called bhutatma bhuta-bhavanah. He gives the living entity the intelligence
with which to improve his position so that he may return home, back to Godhead, or if he does not want
to go back to Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence with which to improve his material position.
This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (15.15). Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah
smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance,
knowledge and forgetfulness." From within, the Lord gives the living being the intelligence with which to
work. Therefore the previous verse said that after the Supreme personality of Godhead endeavors, our
endeavors begin. We cannot independently endeavor or act upon anything. Therefore the Lord is bhutabhavanah.
Another specific feature of the knowledge given in this verse is that sabda-brahma is also a form of the
Supreme Lord. In His eternal, blissful form, Lord Krsna is accepted by Arjuna as param brahma. A living
entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called maya or avidya--
ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then
distinguish between avidya and vidya, which are elaborately explained in the Isopanisad. When one is
actually on the platform of vidya, he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms
like those of Lord Rama, Lord Krsna and Sankarsana. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing
of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that
when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities
gradually develop. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, pranavah sarva-vedesu: "I am the syllable om in all the
Vedic mantras." Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound pranava, omkara.
The same transcendental sound is Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Abhinnatvan nama-naminoh: there is no difference between the holy name
of the Lord and the Lord Himself.

loke vitatam atmanam
lokam catmani santatam

loke--in this material world; vitatam--expanded (in the spirit of material enjoyment); atmanam--the
living entity; lokam--the material world; ca--also; atmani--in the living entity; santatam--spread;
ubhayam--both (the material world of material elements and the living entity); ca--and; maya--by Me;
vyaptam--pervaded; mayi--in Me; ca--also; eva--indeed; ubhayam--both of them; krtam--created.
In this world of matter, which the conditioned soul accepts as consisting of enjoyable resources, the
conditioned soul expands, thinking that he is the enjoyer of the material world. Similarly, the material
world expands in the living entity as a source of enjoyment. In this way they both expand, but because
they are My energies, they are both pervaded by Me. As the Supreme Lord, I am the cause of these effects,
and one should know that both of them rest in Me.
The Mayavada philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable. This dangerous theory
of the Mayavada school has turned people in general toward atheism. On the strength of this theory, one
thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (maya tatam idam sarvam jagad
avyakta-murtina), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord's
energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities. The living entities wrongly
consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be
the enjoyers. However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord. The original
cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However,
although the expansion of the Lord's energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord
Himself has expanded in different ways. To condemn the theories of the Mayavadis, the Lord clearly says
in Bhagavad-gita, mat-sthani sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah: "All beings are in Me, but I am not
in them." Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does
not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself. The material expansion is temporary, but
the Lord is not temporary. The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself. The
living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is. The theory that the Lord's
energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken.

When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great
mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away. Sometimes when
one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place. Then he sees
himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on. All the
conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is
unaffected by them.
None of these conditions of the living entities--namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness--is
substantial. They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life. There may be many mountains,
rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be
nearby. Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross
dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor. Under
the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world. One is
situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy,
which works under the direction of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord is
the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, Sri
Krsna. As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of prakrti, or nature, which works under
the Lord's direction (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram). Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, (miche)
mayara vase, yaccha bhese', khaccha habudubu, bhai: "Why are you being carried away by the waves of
the illusory energy in various phases of dreaming and wakefulness? These are all creations of maya." Our
only duty is to remember the supreme director of this illusory energy--Krsna. For us to do this, the sastra
advises us, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam: one should constantly chant the holy name of
the Lord--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare. The Supreme Lord is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan, but
Bhagavan is the ultimate realization. One who realizes Bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna--is the most perfect mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). In the human form
of life, one should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for then one will understand
everything else. Yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. According to this Vedic injunction, simply
by understanding Krsna one understands Brahman, Paramatma, prakrti, the illusory energy, the spiritual
energy and everything else. Everything will be revealed. prakrti, the material nature, is. working under the
direction of the Supreme Lord, and we living entities are being carried away by various phases of prakrti.
For self-realization, one should always remember Krsna. As stated in Padma Purana, smartavyah satatam
visnuh: we should always remember Lord Visnu. Vismartavyo na jatucit: we should never forget the Lord.
This is the perfection of life.

Know Me to be the Supreme Brahman, the all-pervading Supersoul through whom the sleeping living
entity can understand his dreaming condition and his happiness beyond the activities of the material
senses. That is to say, I am the cause of the activities of the sleeping living being.
When the living entity becomes free from false ego, he understands his superior position as a spirit soul,
part and parcel of the pleasure potency of the Lord. Thus, due to Brahman, even while sleeping the living
entity can enjoy. The Lord says, "That Brahman, that Paramatma and that Bhagavan are I Myself." This is
noted by Srila Jiva Gosvami in his Krama-sandarbha.

taj jnanam brahma tat param
ubhayam--both types of consciousness (sleep and wakefulness); smaratah--remembering; pumsah--of
the person; prasvapa--of consciousness during sleep; pratibodhayoh--and of consciousness while awake;
anveti--extends through; vyatiricyeta--may reach beyond; tat--that; jnanam--knowledge; brahma--the
Supreme Brahman; tat--that; param--transcendental.
If one's dreams during sleep are merely subject matters witnessed by the Supersoul, how can the living
entity, who is different from the Supersoul, remember the activities of dreams? The experiences of one
person cannot be understood by another. Therefore the knower of the facts, the living entity who inquires
into the incidents manifested in dreams and wakefulness, is different from the circumstantial activities.
That knowing factor is Brahman. In other words, the quality of knowing belongs to the living entities and
to the Supreme Soul. Thus the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams and wakefulness.
In both stages the knower is unchanged, but is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman.
In knowledge the living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman, but the quantity of the
Supreme Brahman is not the same as that of the living entity, who is part of Brahman. Because the living
entity is Brahman in quality, he can remember the past activities of dreams and also know the present
activities of wakefulness.

yad etad vismrtam pumso

yat--which; etat--this; vismrtam--forgotten; pumsah--of the living entity; mat-bhavam--My spiritual
position; bhinnam--separation; atmanah--from the Supreme Soul; tatah--from that; samsarah--material,
conditional life; etasya--of the living entity; dehat--from one body; dehah--another body; mrteh--from one
death; mrtih--another death.
When a living entity, thinking himself different from Me, forgets his spiritual identity of qualitative
oneness with Me in eternity, knowledge and bliss, his material, conditional life begins. In other words,
instead of identifying his interest with Mine, he becomes interested in his bodily expansions like his wife,
children and material possessions. In this way, by the influence of his actions, one body comes from
another, and after one death, another death takes place.
Generally the Mayavadi philosophers or persons influenced by Mayavadi philosophers think themselves
as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the cause of their conditional life. As stated by the
Vaisnava poet Jagadananda Pandita in his Prema-vivarta:
krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga vancha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
As soon as a living entity forgets his constitutional position and endeavors to become one with the
Supreme, his conditional life begins. The conception that the Supreme Brahman and the living entity are
equal not only in quality but also in quantity is the cause of conditional life. If one forgets the difference
between the Supreme Lord and the living entity, his conditional life begins. Conditional life means giving
up one body to accept another and undergoing death to accept death again. The Mayavadi philosopher
teaches the philosophy of tat tvam asi, saying, "You are the same as God." He forgets that tat tvam asi
applies in terms of the marginal position of the living entity, who is like sunshine. There is heat and light
in the sun, and there is heat and light in the sunshine, and thus they are qualitatively one. But one should
not forget that the sunshine rests on the sun. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi
pratisthaham: "I am the original source of Brahman." The sunshine is important because of the presence
of the sun globe. It is not that the sun globe is important because of the all-pervasiveness of the sunshine.
Forgetfulness and misunderstanding of this fact is called maya. Because of forgetfulness of one's
constitutional position and that of the Supreme Lord, one comes into maya, or samsara--conditional life.
In this regard, Madhvacarya says:
sarva-bhinnam paratmanam
vismaran samsared iha
abhinnam samsmaran yati
tamo nasty atra samsayah
When one thinks that the living entity is nondifferent in all respects from the Supreme Lord, there is no
doubt that he is in ignorance (tamah).

This statement is confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 9.41). Lord Caitanya said:

Everyone born in India, especially as a human being, can achieve the supreme success through the

Remembering the great trouble found in the field of activities performed for fruitive results, and
remembering how one receives the reverse of the results one desires--whether from material actions or
from the fruitive activities recommended in the Vedic literatures--an intelligent man should cease from
the desire for fruitive actions, for by such endeavors one cannot achieve the ultimate goal of life. On the
other hand, if one acts without desires for fruitive results--in other words, if one engages in devotional
activities--he can achieve the highest goal of life with freedom from miserable conditions. Considering
this, one should cease from material desires.

unhappiness.

fruitive results in the present life and in the next. Thus becoming experienced in transcendental

while looking on; tasya--he; visva-atma--the Supersoul of the whole universe; tatah--from there; ca--also;
antardadhe--disappeared; harih--Lord Hari.
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: After thus instructing Citraketu and assuring him of perfection in this
way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme spiritual master, the supreme soul,
Sankarsana, disappeared from that place as Citraketu looked on.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord."
Chapter Seventeen
Mother Parvati Curses Citraketu
The Seventeenth Chapter is summarized as follows. This chapter describes Citraketu's receiving the
body of an asura, or demon, because of joking with Lord Siva.
After personally talking with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Citraketu enjoyed life in his
airplane with the women of the Vidyadhara planet. Engaging in the congregational chanting of the glories
of the Lord, he began flying his plane and traveling in outer space. One day while traveling like this, he
wandered into the bowers of Sumeru Mountain, where he came upon Lord Siva embracing Parvati,
surrounded by an assembly of Siddhas, Caranas and great sages. Seeing Lord Siva in that situation,
Citraketu laughed very loudly, but Parvati became very angry at him and cursed him. Because of this
curse, Citraketu later appeared as the demon Vrtrasura.
Citraketu, however, was not at all afraid of Parvati's curse, and thus he spoke as follows: "Everyone in
human society enjoys happiness and distress according to his past deeds and in this way travels in the
material world. Therefore no one is responsible for his happiness and distress. One is controlled by the
influence of material nature in the material world, yet one thinks himself the doer of everything. In this
material world, which is made of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, one is sometimes cursed and
sometimes favored, and thus he sometimes enjoys in the upper planetary systems and sometimes suffers
in the lower planets, but all these situations are the same because they are within this material world.
None of these positions has any factual existence, for all of them are temporary. The Supreme Personality
of Godhead is the ultimate controller because the material world is created, maintained and annihilated
under His control while He nonetheless remains neutral to these different transformations of the material
world in time and space. The material, external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in
charge of this material world. The Lord helps the world by creating situations for the living entities within
it."
When Citraketu spoke in this way, all the members in the great assembly in which Lord Siva and Parvati
were present were astonished. Then Lord Siva began speaking about the devotees of the Lord. A devotee is
neutral in all conditions of life, whether in the heavenly planets or hellish planets, whether liberated from
the material world or conditioned by it, and whether blessed with happiness or subjected to distress.
These are all merely dualities created by the external energy. Being influenced by the external energy, the
living entity accepts a gross and subtle material body, and in this illusory position he apparently suffers
miseries, although everyone is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The so-called demigods consider
themselves independent lords, and in this way they are misled from understanding that all living entities
are part of the Supreme. This chapter concludes by glorifying the devotee and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

Being praised by great sages and saints and by the inhabitants of Siddhaloka and Caranaloka, Citraketu,
the most powerful mystic yogi, wandered about enjoying life for millions of years. With bodily strength
and senses free from deterioration, he traveled within the valleys of Sumeru Mountain, which is the place
of perfection for various kinds of mystic power. In those valleys he enjoyed life with the women of
Vidyadhara-loka by chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, Hari.
It is to be understood that Maharaja Citraketu, although surrounded by beautiful women from
Vidyadhara-loka, did not forget to glorify the Lord by chanting the holy name of the Lord. It has been
proved in many places that one who is not contaminated by any material condition, who is a pure devotee
engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord, should be understood to be perfect.

One time while King Citraketu was traveling in outer space on a brilliantly effulgent airplane given to
him by Lord Visnu, he saw Lord Siva, surrounded by Siddhas and Caranas. Lord Siva was sitting in an
assembly of great saintly persons and embracing Parvati on his lap with his arm. Citraketu laughed loudly
and spoke, within the hearing of Parvati.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection,
bhaktim bhutim harir dattva
sva-vicchedanubhutaye
devyah sapena vrtratvam
nitva tam svantike 'nayat
The purport is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to bring Citraketu to Vaikunthaloka as
soon as possible. The Lord's plan was that Citraketu be cursed by Parvati to become Vrtrasura so that in
his next life he could quickly return home, back to Godhead. There have been many instances in which a
devotee acting as a demon has been brought to the kingdom of God by the mercy of the Lord. For Parvati
to be embraced by Lord Siva was natural in a relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing
extraordinary for Citraketu to see. Nonetheless, Citraketu laughed loudly to see Lord Siva in that
situation, even though he should not have done so. Thus he was eventually cursed, and this curse was the
cause of his returning home, back to Godhead.

Lord Siva, whose hair is matted on his head, has certainly undergone great austerities and penances.
Indeed, he is the president in the assembly of strict followers of Vedic principles. Nonetheless, he is seated
with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her as if he were a shameless,
ordinary human being.
Citraketu appreciated the exalted position of Lord Siva, and therefore he remarked at how wonderful it
was that Lord Siva was acting like an ordinary human being. He appreciated Lord Siva's position, but
when he saw Lord Siva sitting in the midst of saintly persons and acting like a shameless, ordinary man,
he was astonished. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that although Citraketu criticized Lord
Siva, he did not offend Lord Siva like Daksa. Daksa considered Lord Siva insignificant, but Citraketu
expressed his wonder at Lord Siva's being situated in that way.

The word maha-vrata-dharah indicates a brahmacari who has never fallen down. Lord Siva is counted
among the best of yogis, yet he embraced his wife in the midst of great saintly persons. Citraketu
appreciated how great Lord Siva was to be unaffected even in that situation. Therefore Citraketu was not
an offender; he merely expressed his wonder.

babhuva--remained; sadasi--in the assembly; sabhyah--everyone assembled there; ca--and; tat-anuvratah--
followed Lord Siva (remained silent).
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after hearing Citraketu's statement, Lord Siva, the
most powerful personality, whose knowledge is fathomless, simply smiled and remained silent, and all the
members of the assembly followed the lord by not saying anything.
Citraketu's purpose in criticizing Lord Siva is somewhat mysterious and cannot be understood by a
common man. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, however, has made the following observations. Lord
Siva, being the most exalted Vaisnava and one of the most powerful demigods, is able to do anything he
desires. Although he was externally exhibiting the behavior of a common man and not following
etiquette, such actions cannot diminish his exalted position. The difficulty is that a common man, seeing
Lord Siva's behavior, might follow his example. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.21):
yad yad acarati sresthas
tat tad evetaro janah
sa yat pramanam kurute
lokas tad anuvartate
"Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by
exemplary acts, all the world pursues." A common man might also criticize Lord Siva, like Daksa, who
suffered the consequences for his criticism. King Citraketu desired that Lord Siva cease this external
behavior so that others might be saved from criticizing him and thus becoming offenders. If one thinks
that Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only perfect personality whereas the demigods,
even such demigods as Lord Siva, are inclined to improper social affairs, he is an offender. Considering all
this, King Citraketu was somewhat harsh in his behavior with Lord Siva.
Lord Siva, who is always deep in knowledge, could understand Citraketu's purpose, and therefore he
was not at all angry; rather, he simply smiled and remained silent. The members of the assembly
surrounding Lord Siva could also understand Citraketu's purpose. Consequently, following the behavior
of Lord Siva, they did not protest; instead, following their master, they remained silent. If the members of
the assembly thought that Citraketu had blasphemed Lord Siva, they would certainly have left at once,
blocking their ears with their hands.

Not knowing the prowess of Lord Siva and Parvati, Citraketu strongly criticized them. His statements
were not at all pleasing, and therefore the goddess Parvati, being very angry, spoke as follows to
Citraketu, who thought himself better than Lord Siva in controlling the senses.
Although Citraketu never meant to insult Lord Siva, he should not have criticized the lord, even though
the lord was transgressing social customs. It is said, tejiyasam na dosaya: one who is very powerful should
be understood to be faultless. For example, one should not find faults with the sun, although it evaporates
urine from the street. The most powerful cannot be criticized by an ordinary man, or even by a great
personality. Citraketu should have known that Lord Siva, although sitting in that way, was not to be
criticized. The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee of Lord Visnu, Sankarsana,
was somewhat proud at having achieved Lord Sankarsana's favor and therefore thought that he could now
criticize anyone, even Lord Siva. This kind of pride in a devotee is never tolerated. A Vaisnava should
always remain very humble and meek and offer respect to others.
trnad api sunicena

"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the

A Vaisnava should not try to minimize anyone else's position. It is better to remain humble and meek and
chant the Hare Krsna mantra. The word nirjitatmabhimanine indicates that Citraketu thought himself a
better controller of the senses than Lord Siva, although actually he was not. Because of all these
considerations, mother Parvati was somewhat angry at Citraketu.

O impudent one, my dear son, now take birth in a low, sinful family of demons so that you will not
commit such an offense again toward exalted, saintly persons in this world.
One should be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of Vaisnavas, of whom Lord Siva is
the best. While instructing Srila Rupa Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu described an offense at the lotus
feet of a Vaisnava as hati mata, a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the
entire garden. Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava, his entire spiritual career is halted. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses
at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava.
Mother Parvati was justified in punishing Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticized the supreme
father, Mahadeva, who is the father of the living entities conditioned within this material world. The
goddess Durga is called mother, and Lord Siva is called father. A pure Vaisnava should be very careful to
engage in his specific duty without criticizing others. This is the safest position. Otherwise, if one tends to
criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vaisnava.
Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vaisnava, he might have been surprised that Parvati had cursed
him. Therefore the goddess Parvati addressed him as putra, or son. Everyone is the son of mother Durga,
but she is not an ordinary mother. As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon's behavior, mother
Durga immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses. This is explained by Lord
Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." To surrender to Krsna means to
surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of Krsna unless he is a proper servant of
a devotee. Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without serving a servant of Krsna, one cannot be
elevated to being a servant of Krsna Himself. Therefore mother Parvati spoke to Citraketu exactly like a
mother who says to her naughty child, "My dear child, I am punishing you so that you won't do anything
like this again." This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Yasoda, who
became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mother Yasoda punished Krsna by binding
Him and showing Him a stick. Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case
of the Supreme Lord. It is to be understood that mother Durga was justified in punishing Citraketu. This
punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon Vrtrasura, he was promoted
directly to Vaikuntha.

yat--which; proktam--prescribed; purva-distam--fixed previously according to one's past deeds; hi--

Citraketu said: My dear mother, with my own hands folded together I accept the curse upon me. I do
not mind the curse, for happiness and distress are given by the demigods as a result of one's past deeds.
Since Citraketu was a devotee of the Lord, he was not at all disturbed by the curse of mother Parvati. He
knew very well that one suffers or enjoys the results of one's past deeds as ordained by daiva-netra--
superior authority, or the agents of the Supreme personality of Godhead. He knew that he had not
committed any offense at the lotus feet of Lord Siva or the goddess Parvati, yet he had been punished, and
this means that the punishment had been ordained. Thus the King did not mind it. A devotee is naturally
so humble and meek that he accepts any condition of life as a blessing from the Lord. Tat te 'nukampam
susamiksamanah (Bhag. 10.14.8). A devotee always accepts punishment from anyone as the mercy of the
Lord. If one lives in this conception of life, he sees whatever reverses occur to be due to his past misdeeds,
and therefore he never accuses anyone. On the contrary, he becomes increasingly attached to the Supreme
personality of Godhead because of his being purified by his suffering. Suffering, therefore, is also a
process of purification.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection that one who has developed Krsna
consciousness and who exists in love with Krsna is no longer subject to suffering and happiness under the
laws of karma. Indeed, he is beyond karma. The Brahma-samhita says, karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhaktibhajam:
a devotee is free from the reactions of his karma because he has taken to devotional service. This
same principle is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26). Sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate:
one who is engaged in devotional service has already been freed from the reactions of his material karma,
and thus he immediately becomes brahma-bhuta, or transcendental. This is also expressed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.21). Ksiyante casya karmani: before attaining the stage of love, one becomes free from all
the results of karma.
The Lord is very kind and affectionate toward His devotees, and therefore a devotee, in any condition, is
not subjected to the results of karma. A devotee never aspires for the heavenly planets. The heavenly
planets, liberation and hell are nondifferent for a devotee, for he does not discriminate between different
positions in the material world. A devotee is always eager to return home, back to Godhead, and remain
there as the Lord's associate. This ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart, and therefore he
does not care about material changes in his life. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that
Maharaja Citraketu's being cursed by Parvati should be considered the mercy of the Lord. The Lord
wanted Citraketu to return to Godhead as soon as possible, and therefore he terminated all the reactions
of his past deeds. Acting through the heart of Parvati, the Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart, cursed
Citraketu in order to end all his material reactions. Thus Citraketu became Vrtrasura in his next life and
returned home, back to Godhead.

As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (3.27):

"The bewildered soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer
of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." Actually a conditioned soul is completely under
the control of material nature. Wandering here and there--always and everywhere--he is subjected to the
results of his past deeds. This is carried out by the laws of nature, but one foolishly thinks himself the
doer, which in fact he is not. To get free from the karma-cakra, the wheel of the results of one's karma,
one should take to bhakti-marga--devotional service, or Krsna consciousness. That is the only remedy.

In this material world, neither the living entity himself nor others [friends and enemies] are the cause of

are the cause.
In this verse the word ajna is very significant. In the material world, all living entities are ajna, ignorant,
in different degrees. This ignorance continues very strongly in the mode of ignorance presented by
material nature. One must therefore promote himself to the stage of goodness through his character and
behavior and then gradually come to the transcendental platform, or adhoksaja platform, in which he
realizes both his position and the position of others. Everything is done under the superintendence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The process by which the results of action are ordained is called
niyatam, always working.

This material world resembles the waves of a constantly flowing river. Therefore, what is a curse and

happiness, and what is actually distress? Because the waves flow constantly, none of them has an eternal
effect.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, (miche) mayara vase, yaccha bhese', khaccha habudubu, bhai: "My
dear living entities within this material world, why are you being carried away by the waves of the modes
of material nature?" (Jiva) krsna-dasa, ei visvasa, karle ta' ara duhkha nai: "If the living entity tries to
understand that he is an eternal servant of Krsna, there will no longer be misery for him." Krsna wants us
to give up all other engagements and surrender unto Him. If we do so, where will the cause and effect of
this material world be? There is nothing like cause and effect for the surrendered soul. Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura says in this regard that being put into this material world is like being thrown into a
mine of salt. If one falls into a mine of salt, he tastes only salt wherever he goes. Similarly, this material
world is full of miseries. The so-called temporary happiness of the world is also misery, but in ignorance
we cannot understand this. That is the actual position. When one comes to his senses--when he becomes
Krsna conscious--he is no longer concerned with the various conditions of this material world. He is not
concerned with happiness or distress, curses or favors, or heavenly or hellish planets. He sees no
distinction between them.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one. Unaffected by the conditions of the material world, He
creates all the conditioned souls by His own personal potency. Because of being contaminated by the
material energy, the living entity is put into ignorance and thus into different conditions of bondage.
Sometimes, by knowledge, the living entity is given liberation. In sattva-guna and rajo-guna, he is
subjected to happiness and distress.
The question may be raised why the living entities are situated in different conditions and who has
arranged this. The answer is that it has been done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without
anyone's help. The Lord has His own energies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate), and one of them,
namely the external energy, creates the material world and the varieties of happiness and distress for the
conditioned souls under the supervision of the Lord. The material world consists of three modes of
material nature--sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. By sattva-guna the Lord maintains the material
world, by rajo-guna He creates it, and by tamo-guna He annihilates it. After the varieties of living entities
are created, they are subject to happiness and distress according to their association. When they are in
sattva-guna, the mode of goodness, they feel happiness, when in rajo-guna they are distressed, and when
in tamo-guna they have no sense of what to do or what is right and wrong.

distress. The two terms happiness and distress are relative. Since the Lord is always happy, for Him there
is no question of distress.

Although the Supreme Lord is unattached to our happiness and distress according to karma, and
although no one is His enemy or favorite, He creates pious and impious activities through the agency of
His material potency. Thus for the continuation of the materialistic way of life He creates happiness and
distress, good fortune and bad, bondage and liberation, birth and death.
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate doer of everything, in His original
transcendental existence He is not responsible for the happiness and distress, or bondage and liberation,
of the conditioned souls. These are due to the results of the fruitive activities of the living entities within
this material world. By the order of a judge, one person is released from jail, and another is imprisoned,
but the judge is not responsible, for the distress and happiness of these different people is due to their
own activities. Although the government is ultimately the supreme authority, the justice is administered
by the departments of the government, and the government is not responsible for the individual
judgments. Therefore the government is equal to all the citizens. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is neutral to
everyone, but for the maintenance of law and order His supreme government has various departments,
which control the activities of the living entities. Another example given in this regard is that lilies open
or close because of the sunshine, and thus the bumblebees enjoy or suffer, but the sunshine and the sun
globe are not responsible for the happiness and distress of the bumblebees.

Lord Siva, the husband of Parvati, told his wife, "My dear Parvati, you are very beautiful in your bodily
features. Certainly you are glorious. But I do not think that you can compete with the beauty and glory of
devotees who have become servants of the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Of course,
Lord Siva smiled when he joked with his wife in that way, for others cannot speak like that. "The
Supreme Lord," Siva continued, "is always exalted in His activities, and here is another example of His
wonderful influence upon King Citraketu, His devotee. Just see, although you cursed the King, he was not
at all afraid or sorry. Rather, he offered respect to you, called you mother and accepted your curse,
thinking himself faulty. He did not say anything in retaliation. This is the excellence of a devotee. By
mildly tolerating your curse, he has certainly excelled the glory of your beauty and your power to curse
him. I can impartially judge that this devotee, Citraketu, has defeated you and your excellence simply by
becoming a pure devotee of the Lord." As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, taror api sahisnuna. Just
like a tree, a devotee can tolerate all kinds of curses and reversals in life. This is the excellence of a
devotee. Indirectly, Lord Siva forbade Parvati to commit the mistake of cursing a devotee like Citraketu.

Parvati might naturally have inquired how devotees become so exalted. Therefore this verse explains
that they are narayana-para, simply dependent on Narayana. They do not mind reverses in life because in
the service of Narayana they have learned to tolerate whatever hardships there may be. They do not care
whether they are in heaven or in hell: they simply engage in the service of the Lord. This is their
excellence. Anukulyena krsnanusilanam: they are liberally engaged in the service of the Lord, and
therefore they are excellent. By using the word bhrtya-bhrtyanam, Lord Siva pointed out that although
Citraketu provided one example of tolerance and excellence, all the devotees who have taken shelter of
the Lord as eternal servants are glorious. They have no eagerness to be happy by being placed in the
heavenly planets, becoming liberated or becoming one with Brahman, the supreme effulgence. These
benefits do not appeal to their minds. They are simply interested in giving direct service to the Lord.

Because of the actions of the Supreme Lord's external energy, the living entities are conditioned in
contact with material bodies. The dualities of happiness and distress, birth and death, curses and favors,
are natural by-products of this contact in the material world.
In Bhagavad-gita we find, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: the material world works under
the direction of the goddess Durga, the material energy of the Lord, but she acts under the direction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.44):
srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka
chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga
Durga--the goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Siva--is extremely powerful. She can create, maintain and
annihilate any number of universes by her sweet will, but she acts under the direction of the Supreme
personality of Godhead, Krsna, not independently. Krsna is impartial, but because this is the material
world of duality, such relative terms as happiness and distress, curses and favors, are created by the will of
the Supreme. Those who are not narayana-para, pure devotees, must be disturbed by this duality of the
material world, whereas devotees who are simply attached to the service of the Lord are not at all
disturbed by it. For example, Haridasa Thakura was beaten with cane in twenty-two bazaars, but he was
never disturbed; instead, he smilingly tolerated the beating. Despite the disturbing dualities of the
material world, devotees are not disturbed at all. Because they fix their minds on the lotus feet of the Lord
and concentrate on the holy name of the Lord, they do not feel the so-called pains and pleasures caused
by the dualities of this material world.

"dvaite" bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba----"manodharma"
"ei bhala, ei manda",----ei saba "bhrama"
The distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental
concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same. They are like the
happiness and distress in dreams. A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming,
although actually they have no existence.
The other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for
want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake. In this connection there is a statement by
Prabodhananda Sarasvati: visvam purna-sukhayate. Everyone in this material world is distressed by
miserable conditions, but Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati says that this world is full of happiness. How is
this possible? He answers, yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah. A devotee accepts
the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. By His personal behavior, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed that He was never distressed
but always happy in chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. One should follow in the footsteps of Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu and engage constantly in chanting the maha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then he will never feel the
distresses of the world of duality. In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of
the Lord.
In dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family
members had died. Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we
are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial
happiness of dreams. The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything
created by the mind in terms of sankalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or
mental concoction.

vasudeve bhagavati
bhaktim udvahatam nrnam
jnana-vairagya-viryanam
na hi kascid vyapasrayah
vasudeve--to Lord Vasudeva, Krsna; bhagavati--the Supreme personality of Godhead; bhaktim--love and
faith in devotional service; udvahatam--for those who are carrying; nrnam--men; jnana-vairagya--of real
knowledge and detachment; viryanam--possessing the powerful strength; na--not; hi--indeed; kascit--
anything; vyapasrayah--as interest or shelter.
Persons engaged in devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, have naturally perfect knowledge and
detachment from this material world. Therefore such devotees are not interested in the so-called
happiness or so-called distress of this world.
Here is the distinction between a devotee and a philosopher who speculates on the subject matter of
transcendence. A devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary
existence of this material world. Because of his unalloyed devotion to Vasudeva, this knowledge and
detachment are automatically manifested in his person. As confirmed elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to Vasudeva, Krsna, automatically becomes aware of
this material world, and therefore he is naturally detached. This detachment is possible because of his
high standard of knowledge. The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is
false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a
devotee, without separate endeavor. The Mayavadi philosophers may be very proud of their so-called
knowledge, but because they do not understand Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti), they do not understand
the world of duality, which is a manifestation of Vasudeva's external energy. Therefore, unless the socalled
jnanis take shelter of Vasudeva, their speculative knowledge is imperfect. Ye 'nye 'ravindaksa
vimukta-maninah. They simply think of becoming free from the contamination of the material world, but
because they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of Vasudeva, their knowledge is impure. When they
actually become pure, they surrender to the lotus feet of Vasudeva. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier
to understand for a devotee than for jnanis who simply speculate to understand Vasudeva. Lord Siva
confirms this statement in the following verse.

Although we are part of the Supreme Lord, we consider ourselves independent, separate controllers, and
thus we cannot understand His identity.
Brahma-samhita (5.33) states:
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam

vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau

"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person. He is absolute,
infallible and beginningless, and although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original
person, the oldest person, who always appears as a fresh youth. The eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of
the Lord can not be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure,
unalloyed devotees." Lord Siva places himself as one of the nondevotees, who cannot understand the
identity of the Supreme Lord. The Lord, being ananta, has an unlimited number of forms. Therefore, how
is it possible for an ordinary, common man to understand Him? Lord Siva, of course, is above the
ordinary human beings, yet be is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Siva is
not among the ordinary living entities, nor is he in the category of Lord Visnu. He is between Lord Visnu
and the common living entity.

He holds no one as very dear and no one as inimical. He has no one for His own relative, and no one is
alien to Him. He is actually the soul of the soul of all living entities. Thus He is the auspicious friend of all
living beings and is very near and dear to all of them.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His second feature, is the Supersoul of all living entities. As
one's self is extremely dear, the Superself of the self is still more dear. No one can be the enemy of the
friendly Superself, who is equal to everyone. Relationships of dearness or enmity between the Supreme
Lord and the living beings are due to the intervention of the illusory energy. Because the three modes of
material nature intervene between the Lord and the living beings, these different relationships appear.
Actually, the living entity in his pure condition is always very near and dear to the Lord, and the Lord is
dear to him. There is no question of partiality or enmity.

This magnanimous Citraketu is a dear devotee of the Lord. He is equal to all living entities and is free
from attachment and hatred. Similarly, I am also very dear to Lord Narayana. Therefore, no one should be
astonished to see the activities of the most exalted devotees of Narayana, for they are free from attachment
and envy. They are always peaceful, and they are equal to everyone.
It is said, vaisnavera kriya, mudra vijneha na bujhaya: one should not be astonished to see the activities
of exalted, liberated Vaisnavas. As one should not be misled by the activities of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one should also not be misled by the activities of His devotees. Both the Lord and His devotees
are liberated. They are on the same platform, the only difference being that the Lord is the master and the
devotees are servants. Qualitatively, they are one and the same. In Bhagavad-gita (9.29) the Lord says:
samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in
devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." From this statement by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, it is clear that the devotees of the Lord are always extremely dear to Him. In
effect, Lord Siva told Parvati, "Both Citraketu and I are always very dear to the Supreme Lord. In other
words, both he and I are on the same level as servants of the Lord. We are always friends, and sometimes
we enjoy joking words between us. When Citraketu loudly laughed at my behavior, he did so on friendly
terms, and therefore there was no reason to curse him." Thus Lord Siva tried to convince his wife, Parvati,
that her cursing of Citraketu was not very sensible.
Here is a difference between male and female that exists even in the higher statuses of life--in fact, even
between Lord Siva and his wife. Lord Siva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but Parvati could not.
Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that
of a female. It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the
understanding of a man. In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and
woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent
than man.
It is clear that Citraketu wanted to criticize the behavior of his friend Lord Siva because Lord Siva was
sitting with his wife on his lap. Then, too, Lord Siva wanted to criticize Citraketu for externally posing as
a great devotee but being interested in enjoying with the Vidyadhari women. These were all friendly jokes;
there was nothing serious for which Citraketu should have been cursed by Parvati. Upon hearing the
instructions of Lord Siva, Parvati must have been very much ashamed for cursing Citraketu to become a
demon. Mother Parvati could not appreciate Citraketu's position, and therefore she cursed him, but when
she understood the instructions of Lord Siva she was ashamed.

The great devotee Citraketu was so powerful that he was quite competent to curse mother Parvati in
retaliation, but instead of doing so he very humbly accepted the curse and bowed his head before Lord
Siva and his wife. This is very much to be appreciated as the standard behavior of a Vaisnava.
Upon being informed by Lord Siva, mother Parvati could understand that she was wrong in cursing
Citraketu. King Citraketu was so exalted in his character that in spite of being wrongly cursed by Parvati,
he immediately descended from his airplane and bowed his head before the mother, accepting her curse.
This has already been explained: narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati. Citraketu very sportingly
felt that since the mother wanted to curse him, he could accept this curse just to please her. This is called
sadhu-laksanam, the characteristic of a sadhu, or a devotee. As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna. A devotee should always be very humble and meek and should
offer all respect to others, especially to superiors. Being protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
a devotee is always powerful, but a devotee does not wish to show his power unnecessarily. However,
when a less intelligent person has some power, he wants to use it for sense gratification. This is not the
behavior of a devotee.

Being cursed by mother Durga [Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva], that same Citraketu accepted birth in a
demoniac species of life. Although still fully equipped with transcendental knowledge and practical
application of that knowledge in life, he appeared as a demon at the fire sacrifice performed by Tvasta,
and thus he became famous as Vrtrasura.
The word yoni is generally understood to mean jati--family, group or species. Although Vrtrasura
appeared in a family of demons, it is clearly said that his knowledge of spiritual life still existed. Jnanavijnana-
samyutah: his spiritual knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge in life were not
lost. Therefore it is said that even if a devotee falls down for some reason, he is still not lost.
yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim

(Bhag. 1.5.17)
Once one is advanced in devotional service, his spiritual assets are never lost under any circumstances.
Whatever spiritual advancement he has achieved continues. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Even if a
bhakti-yogi falls, he takes birth in a rich family or family of brahmanas, in which he again starts
devotional activities from the point where he left off. Although Vrtrasura was known as an asura, or
demon, he did not lose his consciousness of Krsna or devotional service.

Citraketu was a great devotee [mahatma]. If one hears this history of Citraketu from a pure devotee, the
listener also is freed from the conditional life of material existence.
The historical incidents in the puranas, such as the history of Citraketu explained in the Bhagavata
purana, are sometimes misunderstood by outsiders, or nondevotees. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami advised
that the history of Citraketu be heard from a devotee. Anything about devotional service or the
characteristics of the Lord and His devotees must be heard from a devotee, not from a professional reciter.
This is advised herein. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's secretary also advised that one learn the history of
Srimad-Bhagavatam from a devotee: yaha, bhagavata pada vaisnavera sthane. One should not hear the
statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam from professional reciters, or else they will not be effective. Quoting
from padma purana, Sri Sanatana Gosvami has strictly forbidden us to hear about the activities of the Lord
and His devotees from the mouths of nondevotees:
avaisnava-mukhodgirnam
putam hari-kathamrtam
sravanam naiva kartavyam
sarpocchistam yatha payah
"One should not hear anything about Krsna from a non-Vaisnava. Milk touched by the lips of a serpent
has poisonous effects; similarly, talks about Krsna given by a non-Vaisnava are also poisonous." One must
be a bona fide devotee, and then he can preach and impress devotional service upon his listeners.

Chapter Eighteen
Diti Vows to Kill King Indra
This chapter gives the history of Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, and how she followed a vow to have a son
who would kill Indra. It also describes how Indra attempted to foil her plan by cutting to pieces the son
within her womb.
In relation to Tvasta and his descendants, there is a description of the dynasty of the Adityas (sons of
Aditi) and other demigods. Prsni, the wife of Aditi's fifth son named Savita, had three daughters--Savitri,
Vyahrti and Trayi--and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Pasu, Soma, Caturmasya and the five
Mahayajnas. Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahima, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also
had one daughter, whose name was Asi. Dhata had four wives--Kuhu, Sinivali, Raka and Anumati--who
had four sons, named Sayam, Darsa, Pratah and Purnamasa respectively. Kriya, the wife of Vidhata, gave
birth to the five Purisyas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods. Bhrgu, the mind-born son of
Brahma, took his birth again from Carsani, the wife of Varuna, and the great sage Valmiki appeared from
Varuna's semen. Agastya and Vasistha were two sons of Varuna and Mitra. Upon seeing the beauty of
Urvasi, Mitra and Varuna discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot. From that pot, Agastya
and Vasistha appeared. Mitra had a wife named Revati, who gave birth to three sons--Utsarga, Arista and
Pippala. Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh. Indra's wife was named Paulomi
(Sacidevi). She gave birth to three sons--Jayanta, Rsabha and Midhusa. By His own powers, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead appeared as Vamanadeva. From His wife, whose name was Kirti, appeared a son
named Brhatsloka. Brhatsloka's first son was known as Saubhaga. This is a description of the sons of Aditi.
A description of Aditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be
offered in the Eighth Canto.
The demons born of Diti are also described in this chapter. In the dynasty of Diti appeared the great
saintly devotee Prahlada and also Bali, Prahlada's grandson. Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa were the first
sons of Diti. Hiranyakasipu and his wife, whose name was Kayadhu, had four sons--Samhlada, Anuhlada,
Hlada and Prahlada. They also had one daughter, whose name was Simhika. In association with the
demon Vipracit, Simhika bore a son named Rahu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Krti, the wife of Samhlada, bore a son named Pancajana. Hlada's wife, whose name was
Dhamani, gave birth to two sons--Vatapi and Ilvala. Ilvala put Vatapi into the form of a ram and gave him
to Agastya to eat. Anuhlada, in the womb of his wife, Surya, begot two sons, named Baskala and Mahisa.
Prahlada's son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Maharaja. Bali Maharaja had
one hundred sons, of whom Bana was the eldest.
After describing the dynasty of the Adityas and the other demigods, Sukadeva Gosvami describes Diti's
sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods. Just to help Indra,
Lord Visnu had killed Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu. Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was
eager to have a son who could kill Indra. By her service, she enchanted Kasyapa Muni in order to beg
from him a greater son to do this. In corroboration of the Vedic injunction vidvamsam api karsati,
Kasyapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request. When, however,
she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow
the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself. When Diti, following the instructions of Kasyapa,
engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her
activities. One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service. Thus he
entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts. In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as
the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons
became Vaisnavas.

Upon seeing Urvasi, the celestial society girl, both Mitra and Varuna discharged semen, which they
preserved in an earthen pot. The two sons Agastya and Vasistha later appeared from that pot, and they are
therefore the common sons of Mitra and Varuna. Mitra begot three sons in the womb of his wife, whose
name was Revati. Their names were Utsarga, Arista and Pippala.
Modern science is trying to generate living entities in test tubes by processing semen, but even long,
long ago it was possible for semen kept in a pot to develop into a child.

He begot one son, named Brhatsloka, who had many sons, headed by Saubhaga.
As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.6):
ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya
"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of
all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." When the
Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates, He does not need any help from the external energy, for He
appears as He is by His own potency. The spiritual potency is also called maya. It is said, ato mayamayam
visnum pravadanti manisinah: the body accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called
mayamaya. This does not mean that He is formed of the external energy; this maya refers to His internal
potency.

Apparently even demons can be elevated to positions as demigods when their atheistic character is
reformed. There are two kinds of men throughout the universe. Those who are devotees of Lord Visnu are
called demigods, and those who are just the opposite are called demons. Even the demons can be
transformed into demigods, as the statement of this verse proves.

Maharaja Pariksit's question was very much appreciated by Sukadeva Gosvami because although it was
composed of a small number of words, it contained meaningful inquiries about how the sons of Diti,
although born as demons, became demigods. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura stresses that even
though Diti was very envious, her heart was purified because of a devotional attitude. Another significant
topic is that although Kasyapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness,
he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife. All these questions were posed in a
small number of words, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated Maharaja Pariksit's
inquiry.

Thinking in this way [with a desire for a son to kill Indra], Diti began constantly acting to satisfy

desired. With service, love, humility and control, with words spoken very sweetly to satisfy her husband,
and with smiles and glances at him, Diti attracted his mind and brought it under her control.
When a woman wants to endear herself to her husband and make him very faithful, she must try to
please him in all respects. When the husband is pleased with his wife, the wife can receive all necessities,
ornaments and full satisfaction for her senses. Herein this is indicated by the behavior of Diti.

In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma, the father of the living entities of the universe, saw that all
the living entities were unattached. To increase population, he then created woman from the better half of
man's body, for woman's behavior carries away a man's mind.
This entire universe is going on under the spell of sexual attachment, which was created by Lord
Brahma to increase the population of the entire universe, not only in human society but also in other
species. As stated by Rsabhadeva in the Fifth Canto, pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam: the entire
world is going on under the spell of sexual attraction and desire between man and woman. When man
and woman unite, the hard knot of this attraction becomes increasingly tight, and thus a man is
implicated in the materialistic way of life. This is the illusion of the material world. This illusion acted
upon Kasyapa Muni, although he was very learned and advanced in spiritual knowledge. As stated in the
Manu-samhita (2.215) and Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.19.17) :
matra svasra duhitra va
naviviktasano bhavet
balavan indriya-gramo
vidvamsam api karsati
"A man should not associate with a woman in a solitary place, not even with his mother, sister or
daughter, for the senses are so strong that they lead astray even a person advanced in knowledge." When a
man remains in a solitary place with a woman, his sexual desires undoubtedly increase. Therefore the
words ekanta-bhutani, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the
company of women as far as possible. Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays
in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter.

A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vasudeva,
the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone's heart and is worshiped through the
various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers. Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as
the object of worship for a woman.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devata-bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is
offered without true understanding." The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and
cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as
various parts of the Lord. If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their
husbands as representatives of Vasudeva, the women benefit, just as Ajamila benefited by calling for
Narayana, his son. Ajamila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of
Narayana, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name. In India a husband is still called pati-guru,
the husband spiritual master. If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in Krsna
consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement. Although the
names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indraya svaha, agnaye svaha), the
Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Visnu. As long as one is very much
attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one's husband is
recommended.

Diti replied: O my husband, O great soul, I have now lost my sons. If you want to give me a benediction,
I ask you for an immortal son who can kill Indra. I pray for this because Indra, with the help of Visnu, has
killed my two sons Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.
The word indra-hanam means "one who can kill Indra," but it also means "one who follows Indra." The
word amrtyum refers to the demigods, who do not die like ordinary human beings because they have
extremely long durations of life. For example, the duration of Lord Brahma's life is stated in Bhagavadgita:
sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh. Even the duration of one day, or twelve hours, of
Brahma is 4,300,000 years multiplied by one thousand. Thus the duration of his life is inconceivable for
an ordinary human being. The demigods are therefore sometimes called amara, which means "one who
has no death." In this material world, however, everyone has to die. Therefore the word amrtyum
indicates that Diti wanted a son who would be equal in status to the demigods.

Upon hearing Diti's request, Kasyapa Muni was very much aggrieved. "Alas," he lamented, "now I face
the danger of the impious act of killing Indra."
Although Kasyapa Muni was eager to fulfill the desire of his wife Diti, when he heard that she wanted a
son to kill Indra his jubilation was immediately reduced to nothing because he was averse to the idea.

This woman, my wife, has adopted a means that follows her nature, and therefore she is not to be
blamed. But I am a man. Therefore, all condemnation upon me! I am not at all conversant with what is
good for me, since I could not control my senses.
The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world. She induces her husband to enjoy this
world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called jihva, udara and upastha. A woman is
expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating. When one eats
nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong. Especially
when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly
becomes sexually inclined. It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual
progress but for gliding down to hell. Thus Kasyapa Muni considered his situation and lamented. In other
words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband. A
husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life. Kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan
iha (Bhag. 7.6.1). During the time of brahmacarya, or student life, a brahmacari should be taught to be
expert in bhagavata-dharma, devotional service. Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her
husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable.
However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense
gratification is not at all good. It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kaliyuga,
dam-patye 'bhirucir hetuh: the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual
power. Therefore householder life in this Kali-yuga is extremely dangerous unless both the wife and
husband take to Krsna consciousness.

abham--like; strinam--of women; kah--who; veda--knows; cestitam--the dealings.
A woman's face is as attractive and beautiful as a blossoming lotus flower during autumn. Her words are
very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman's heart, we can understand it to be
extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor. In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a
woman?
Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by Kasyapa Muni. Women are
generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are
very attractive to men. Therefore a woman's face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn. Just
as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely
attractive. In Sanskrit a woman's voice is called nari-svara because women generally sing and their singing
is very attractive. At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome.
Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing. Therefore, as taught by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, a woman's singing is dangerous because it can make a sannyasi fall a victim to the woman.
Sannyasa means giving up the company of women, but if a sannyasi hears the voice of a woman and sees
her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down. There have been many
examples. Even the great sage Visvamitra fell a victim to Menaka. Therefore a person desiring to advance
in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman's face or hear a woman's voice.
To see a woman's face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman's voice and appreciate her singing as
very nice is a subtle falldown for a brahmacari or sannyasi. Thus the description of a woman's features by
Kasyapa Muni is very instructive.
When a woman's bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet,
she is naturally a trap for a man. The sastras advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she
should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass. In the fields there are many such wells, and a
man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down. Thus there are many such
instructions. Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, Kasyapa Muni
thought, "Under the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman?" Canakya Pandita has
also advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: "There are two persons one should not trust--a
politician and a woman." These, of course, are authoritative sastric injunctions, and we should therefore
be very careful in our dealings with women.
Sometimes our Krsna consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but Krsna
consciousness is meant for anyone. Whether one is a man or woman does not matter. Lord Krsna
personally says, striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te 'pi yanti param gatim: whether one is a woman, sudra or
vaisya, not to speak of being a brahmana or ksatriya, everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if
he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and sastra. We therefore request all the members
of the Krsna consciousness movement--both men and women--not to be attracted by bodily features but
only to be attracted by Krsna. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise there will be danger.

na--not; hi--certainly; kascit--anyone; priyah--dear; strinam--to women; anjasa--actually; sva-asisa--for
their own interests; atmanam--most dear; patim--husband; putram--son; bhrataram--brother; va--or;
ghnanti--they kill; arthe--for their own interests; ghatayanti--cause to be killed; ca--also.
To satisfy their own interests, women deal with men as if the men were most dear to them, but no one is
actually dear to them. Women are supposed to be very saintly, but for their own interests they can kill
even their husbands, sons or brothers, or cause them to be killed by others.
A woman's nature has been particularly well studied by Kasyapa Muni. Women are self-interested by
nature, and therefore they should be protected by all means so that their natural inclination to be too selfinterested
will not be manifested. Women need to be protected by men. A woman should be cared for by
her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age. This is the
injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage. Women must
be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness. There
have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take
advantage of their insurance policies. This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their
nature. Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life.
When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life
practically vanishes. We should see all women as spiritual units (aham brahmasmi), whose only duty is to
satisfy Krsna. Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one's
possessing a material body, will not act.
The Krsna consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination
of material nature, which results from one's possessing a material body. Bhagavad-gita therefore teaches,
in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the
body but a spiritual soul. Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body.
As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled,
whether one is a man or a woman. The soul is sometimes described as purusa because whether one is
dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world. One who has this spirit of
enjoyment is described as purusa. Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving
others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses. Krsna consciousness, however, provides
first-class training for a man or a woman. A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord
Krsna, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband. That will make the
lives of both of them happy.

I promised to give her a benediction, and this promise cannot be violated, but Indra does not deserve to
be killed. In these circumstances, the solution I have is quite suitable.
Kasyapa Muni concluded, "Diti is eager to have a son who can kill Indra, since she is a woman, after all,
and is not very intelligent. I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill
Indra, she will become a Vaisnava, a devotee of Krsna. If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of
the Vaisnava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed." Ceto-darpana-marjanam.
This is the process of devotional service. Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional
service in Krsna consciousness, for Krsna consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest
class of men and transform them into the topmost Vaisnavas. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement aims
at this purpose. Narottama dasa Thakura says:
vrajendra-nandana yei, saci-suta haila sei,
balarama ha-ila nitai
dina-hina yata chila, hari-name uddharila,
ta'ra saksi jagai-madhai
The appearance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in this Kali-yuga is especially meant to deliver the fallen
souls, who are always planning something for material enjoyment. He gave the people of this age the
advantage of being able to chant the Hare Krsna mantra and thus become fully pure, free from all material
contamination. Once one becomes a pure Vaisnava, he transcends all material conceptions of life. Thus
Kasyapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vaisnavi so that she might give up the idea of killing
Indra. He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vaisnavas.
Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vaisnava principles, and there is a chance that he
may fall down, but Kasyapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vaisnava principles,
he is still not a loser. Even a fallen Vaisnava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.
Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even practicing the Vaisnava principles to a small
extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence. Thus Kasyapa Muni planned to
instruct his wife Diti to become a Vaisnava because he wanted to save the life of Indra.

friend of the demigods); samvatsaram--for a year; vratam--vow; idam--this; yadi--if; anjah--

Kasyapa Muni said: My dear gentle wife, if you follow my instructions regarding this vow for at least
one year, you will surely get a son who will be able to kill Indra. However, if you deviate from this vow of
following the Vaisnava principles, you will get a son who will be favorable to Indra.
The word indra-ha refers to an asura who is always eager to kill Indra. An enemy of Indra is naturally a
friend to the asuras, but the word indra-ha also refers to one who follows Indra or who is obedient to him.
When one becomes a devotee of Indra, he is certainly a friend to the demigods. Thus the words indrahadeva-
bandhavah are equivocal, for they say, "Your son will kill Indra, but he will be very friendly to the
demigods." If a person actually became a friend of the demigods, he certainly would not be able to kill
Indra.

As stated above, a woman is generally inclined to serve her own purposes. Kasyapa Muni proposed to
train Diti to fulfill her desires within one year, and since she was eager to kill Indra, she immediately
agreed, saying, "Please let me know what the vow is and how I have to follow it. I promise that I shall do
the needful and not break the vow." This is another side of a woman's psychology. Even though a woman
is very fond of fulfilling her own plans, when someone instructs her, especially her husband, she
innocently follows, and thus she can be trained for better purposes. By nature a woman wants to be a
follower of a man; therefore if the man is good the woman can be trained for a good purpose.

Kasyapa Muni said: My dear wife, to follow this vow, do not be violent or cause harm to anyone. Do not
curse anyone, and do not speak lies. Do not cut your nails and hair, and do not touch impure things like
skulls and bones.
Kasyapa Muni's first instruction to his wife was not to be envious. The general tendency of anyone
within this material world is to be envious, and therefore, to become a Krsna conscious person, one must
curb this tendency, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (paramo nirmatsaranam). A Krsna conscious person
is always nonenvious, whereas others are always envious. Thus Kasyapa Muni's instruction that his wife
not be envious indicates that this is the first stage of advancement in Krsna consciousness. Kasyapa Muni
desired to train his wife to be a Krsna conscious person, for this would suffice to protect both her and
Indra.

Generally the goddess Kali is offered food containing meat and fish, and therefore Kasyapa Muni strictly

offered to the demigods. A Vaisnava is always fixed in accepting prasada offered to Lord Visnu. Through

After eating, you should not go out to the street without having washed your mouth, hands and feet.
You should not go out in the evening or with your hair loose, nor should you go out unless you are
properly decorated with ornaments. You should not leave the house unless you are very grave and are
sufficiently covered.
Kasyapa Muni advised his wife not to go out onto the street unless she was well decorated and well
dressed. He did not encourage the miniskirts that have now become fashionable. In Oriental civilization,
when a woman goes out onto the street, she must be fully covered so that no man will recognize who she
is. All these methods are to be accepted for purification. If one takes to Krsna consciousness, one is fully
purified, and thus one remains always transcendental to the contamination of the material world.

If one is trained to honor and worship the cows and brahmanas, he is actually civilized. The worship of
the Supreme Lord is recommended, and the Lord is very fond of the cows and brahmanas (namo
brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca). In other words, a civilization in which there is no respect for
the cows and brahmanas is condemned. One cannot become spiritually advanced without acquiring the
brahminical qualifications and giving protection to cows. Cow protection insures sufficient food prepared
with milk, which is needed for an advanced civilization. One should not pollute civilization by eating the
flesh of cows. A civilization must do something progressive, and then it is an Aryan civilization. Instead of
killing the cow to eat flesh, civilized men must prepare various milk products that will enhance the
condition of society. If one follows the brahminical culture, he will become competent in Krsna
consciousness.

Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Indra, by his yogic power, first expanded the body of
the one Marut into seven, and then when he cut each of the seven parts of the original body into pieces,
there were forty-nine. When each body was cut into seven, other living entities entered the new bodies,
and thus they were like plants, which become separate entities when cut into various parts and planted on
a hill. The first body was one, and when it was cut into many pieces, many other living entities entered
the new bodies.

worshiped Lord Visnu for almost one year, adhering to a great vow. Because of such strength in spiritual
life, the forty-nine Maruts were born. How, then, is it wonderful that the Maruts, although born from the

When Diti, Indra's aunt, explained to Indra without reservations what she had wanted to do, Indra
explained his intentions to her. Thus both of them, instead of being enemies, freely spoke the truth. This

For one who engages in worshiping Lord Visnu, nothing is very wonderful. This is a fact. In Bhagavadgita

yatra yogesvarah krsno
yatra partho dhanur-dharah

"Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer,
there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality. That is my opinion."
Yogesvara is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic yoga, who can do anything and

Although those who are interested only in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not
desire anything material from the Lord and do not even want liberation, Lord Krsna fulfills all their
desires.
When Dhruva Maharaja saw Lord Visnu, he declined to take any benedictions from Him, for he was
fully satisfied by seeing the Lord. Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that because Dhruva Maharaja, in the
beginning, had desired a kingdom greater than his father's, he was promoted to Dhruvaloka, the best
planet in the universe. Therefore in the sastra it is said:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"A person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of material desires, free from material desires,
or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead." (Bhag.
2.3.10) One should engage in full devotional service. Then, even though he has no desires, whatever
desires he previously had can all be fulfilled simply by his worship of the Lord. The actual devotee does
not desire even liberation (anyabhilasita-sunyam). The Lord, however, fulfills the desire of the devotee by
awarding him opulence that will never be destroyed. A karmi's opulence is destroyed, but the opulence of
a devotee is never destroyed. A devotee becomes more and more opulent as he increases his devotional
service to the Lord.

The ultimate goal of all ambitions is to become a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If an
intelligent man serves the most dear Lord, who gives Himself to His devotees, how can he desire material
happiness, which is available even in hell?
An intelligent man will never aspire to become a devotee to achieve material happiness. That is the test
of a devotee. As Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu teaches:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi
"O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I
want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service birth after birth." A pure
devotee never begs the Lord for material happiness in the shape of riches, followers, a good wife or even
mukti. The Lord promises, however, yoga-ksemam vahamy aham: "I voluntarily bring everything
necessary for My service."

My dear King Pariksit, I have replied as far as possible to the questions you have asked me, especially in
regard to this pure, auspicious narration about the Maruts. Now you may inquire further, and I shall
explain more.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sixth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Diti Vows to Kill King Indra."
Chapter Nineteen
Performing the Pumsavana Ritualistic Ceremony
This chapter explains how Diti, Kasyapa Muni's wife, executed Kasyapa Muni's instructions on
devotional service. During the first day of the bright fortnight of the moon in the month of Agrahayana
(November-December), every woman, following in the footsteps of Diti and following the instructions of
her own husband, should begin this pumsavana-vrata. In the morning, after washing her teeth, bathing
and thus becoming purified, she should hear about the birth mystery of the Maruts. Then, covering her
body with a white dress and being properly ornamented, before breakfast she should worship Lord Visnu
and mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, Lord Visnu's wife, by glorifying Lord Visnu for His mercy,
patience, prowess, ability, greatness and other glories and for how He can bestow all mystic benedictions.
While offering the Lord all paraphernalia for worship, such as ornaments, a sacred thread, scents, nice
flowers, incense and water for bathing and washing His feet, hands and mouth, one should invite the Lord
with this mantra: om namo bhagavate maha-purusaya mahanubhavaya mahavibhutipataye saha mahavibhutibhir
balim upaharami. Then one should offer twelve oblations in the fire while chanting this
mantra: om namo bhagavate maha-purusaya mahavibhuti-pataye svaha. One should offer obeisances
while chanting this mantra ten times. Then one should chant the Laksmi-Narayana mantra.
If either a pregnant woman or her husband regularly discharges this devotional service, both of them
will receive the result. After continuing this process for one full year, the chaste wife should fast on the
purnima, the full-moon day, of Karttika. On the following day, the husband should worship the Lord as
before and then observe a festival by cooking nice food and distributing prasada to the brahmanas. Then,
with the permission of the brahmanas, the husband and wife should take prasada. This chapter ends by
glorifying the results of the pumsavana function.

service with a vow of penance, for it can fulfill all one's desires. Before beginning the worship of Lord
Visnu, the woman should hear the story of how the Maruts were born. Under the instructions of qualified
brahmanas, in the morning she should wash her teeth, bathe, and dress herself with white cloth and
ornaments, and before taking breakfast she should worship Lord Visnu and Laksmi.

[She should then pray to the Lord as follows.] My dear Lord, You are full in all opulences, but I do not
beg You for opulence. I simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the husband and master
of Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, who has all opulences. Therefore You are the master of all mystic
yoga. I simply offer my obeisances unto You.
A devotee knows how to appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
om purnam adah purnam idam

purnasya purnam adaya

"The personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all
emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes.
Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole,
even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance." Therefore, to
take shelter of the Supreme Lord is required. Whatever a devotee needs will be supplied by the complete
Supreme Personality of Godhead (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham). Therefore a
pure devotee will not ask anything from the Lord. He simply offers the Lord his respectful obeisances, and
the Lord is prepared to accept whatever the devotee can secure to worship Him, even patram puspam
phalam toyam--a leaf, flower, fruit or water. There is no need to artificially exert oneself. It is better to be
plain and simple and with respectful obeisances offer to the Lord whatever one can secure. The Lord is
completely able to bless the devotee with all opulences.

O my Lord, because You are endowed with causeless mercy, all opulences, all prowess and all glories,
strength and transcendental qualities, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of
everyone.
In this verse the words tato 'si bhagavan prabhuh mean "Therefore You are the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the master of everyone." The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all six
opulences in full, and moreover He is extremely kind to His devotee. Although He is full in Himself, He
nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service.
Thus He becomes satisfied. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His
devotee offers Him patram puspam phalam toyam--a leaf, flower, fruit or water--in devotion. Sometimes
the Lord, as the child of mother Yasoda, requests His devotee for some food, as if He were very hungry.
Sometimes He tells His devotee in a dream that His temple and His garden are now very old and that He
cannot enjoy them very nicely. Thus He requests the devotee to repair them. Sometimes He is buried in
the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him. Sometimes He
requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to
perform this task. Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and
is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees. Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is
extremely confidential. Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on
His devotee for some particular work. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (11.33), where the Lord tells
Arjuna, nimitta-matram bhava savyasacin: "O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight." Lord Krsna
had the competence to win the Battle of Kuruksetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to
fight and become the cause of victory. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was quite competent enough to spread
His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work.
Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord's self-sufficiency is that He
depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy. The devotee who has perceived this causeless
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant.

[After profusely offering obeisances unto Lord Visnu, the devotee should offer respectful obeisances
unto mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, and pray as follows.] O wife of Lord Visnu, O internal
energy of Lord Visnu, you are as good as Lord Visnu Himself, for you have all of His qualities and
opulences. O goddess of fortune, please be kind to me. O mother of the entire world, I offer my respectful
obeisances unto you.
The Lord has multifarious potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). Since mother Laksmi, the
goddess of fortune, is the Lord's very precious potency, she is addressed here as maha-maye. The word
maya means sakti. Lord Visnu, the Supreme, cannot exhibit His power everywhere without His principal
energy. It is said, sakti saktiman abheda: the power and the powerful are identical. Therefore mother
Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is the constant companion of Lord Visnu; they remain together
constantly. One cannot keep Laksmi in one's home without Lord Visnu. To think that one can do so is
very dangerous. To keep Laksmi, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always
dangerous, for then Laksmi becomes the illusory energy. With Lord Visnu, however, Laksmi is the
spiritual energy.

If one desires all opulences, his duty is to daily worship Lord Visnu with His wife, Laksmi. With great
devotion one should worship Him according to the above-mentioned process. Lord Visnu and the goddess
of fortune are an immensely powerful combination. They are the bestowers of all benedictions and the
sources of all good fortune. Therefore the duty of everyone is to worship Laksmi-Narayana.
Laksmi-Narayana--Lord Visnu and mother Laksmi--are always situated in everyone's heart (isvarah
sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). However, because nondevotees do not realize that Lord Visnu
stays with His eternal consort, Laksmi, within the hearts of all living entities, they are not endowed with
the opulence of Lord Visnu. Unscrupulous men sometimes address a poor man as daridra-narayana, or
"poor Narayana." This is most unscientific. Lord Visnu and Laksmi are always situated in everyone's
heart, but this does not mean that everyone is Narayana, especially not those in poverty. This is a most
abominable term to use in connection with Narayana. Narayana never becomes poor, and therefore He
can never be called daridra-narayana. Narayana is certainly situated in everyone's heart, but He is neither
poor nor rich. Only unscrupulous persons who do not know the opulence of Narayana try to afflict Him
with poverty.

and form, whereas You are the support of all such names and forms and the cause for their manifestation.
Madhvacarya, the acarya of the Tattvavadis, has described this verse in the following way: "Visnu is
described as yajna personified, and mother Laksmi is described as spiritual activities and the original form
of worship. In fact, they represent spiritual activities and the Supersoul of all yajna. Lord Visnu is the
Supersoul even of Laksmidevi, but no one can be the Supersoul of Lord Visnu, for Lord Visnu Himself is
the spiritual Supersoul of everyone."
According to Madhvacarya, there are two tattvas, or factors. One is independent, and the other is
dependent. The first tattva is the Supreme Lord, Visnu, and the second is the jiva-tattva. Laksmidevi,
being dependent on Lord Visnu, is sometimes counted among the jivas. The Gaudiya Vaisnavas, however,
describe Laksmidevi in accordance with the following two verses from the Prameya-ratnavali of Baladeva
Vidyabhusana. The first verse is a quotation from the Visnu Purana.
nityaiva sa jagan-mata
visnoh srir anapayini
yatha sarva-gato visnus
tathaiveyam dvijottama
visnoh syuh saktayas tisras
tasu ya kirtita para
saiva sris tad-abhinneti
praha sisyan prabhur mahan
"O best of the brahmanas, Laksmiji is the constant companion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Visnu, and therefore she is called anapayini. She is the mother of all creation. As Lord Visnu is allpervading,
His spiritual potency, mother Laksmi, is also all-pervading." Lord Visnu has three principal
potencies--internal, external and marginal. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has accepted para-sakti, the spiritual
energy of the Lord, as being identical with the Lord. Thus she is also included in the independent visnutattva."
In the Kanti-mala commentary on the Prameya-ratnavali there is this statement: nanu kvacit nityamukta
jivatvam laksmyah svikrtam, tatraha--praheti. nityaiveti padye sarva-vyapti-kathanena kalakasthety
adi-padya-dvaye, suddho 'pity ukta ca mahaprabhuna svasisyan prati laksmya bhagavad-advaitam
upadistam. kvacid yat tasyas tu dvaitam uktam, tat tu tad-avista-nitya-mukta jivam adaya sangatamas tu.
"Although some authoritative Vaisnava disciplic successions count the goddess of fortune among the
ever-liberated living entities (jivas) in Vaikuntha, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in accordance with the
statement in the Visnu Purana, has described Laksmi as being identical with the visnu-tattva. The correct
conclusion is that the descriptions of Laksmi as being different from Visnu are stated when an eternally
liberated living entity is imbued with the quality of Laksmi; they do not pertain to mother Laksmi, the
eternal consort of Lord Visnu."

krtam--executed; ekatarena--by one; api--even; dam-patyoh--of the wife and husband; ubhayoh--of both;

Between the husband and wife, one person is sufficient to execute this devotional service. Because of
their good relationship, both of them will enjoy the result. Therefore if the wife is unable to execute this
process, the husband should carefully do so, and the faithful wife will share the result.
The relationship between husband and wife is firmly established when the wife is faithful and the
husband sincere. Then even if the wife, being weaker, is unable to execute devotional service with her
husband, if she is chaste and sincere she shares half of her husband's activities.

its execution to engage in anything else. By offering the remnants of prasada, flower garlands, sandalwood
pulp and ornaments, one should daily worship the brahmanas and worship women who peacefully live
with their husbands and children. Every day the wife must continue following the regulative principles to
worship Lord Visnu with great devotion. Thereafter, Lord Visnu should be laid in His bed, and then one
should take prasada. In this way, husband and wife will be purified and will have all their desires fulfilled.

If this vow or ritualistic ceremony is observed according to the description of sastra, even in this life a
man will be able to achieve all the benedictions he desires from the Lord. A wife who performs this
ritualistic ceremony will surely receive good fortune, opulence, sons, a long-living husband, a good
reputation and a good home.
In Bengal even today if a woman lives for a long time with her husband, she is considered very
fortunate. A woman generally desires a good husband, good children, a good home, prosperity, opulence
and so on. As recommended in this verse, a woman will receive all these desirable benedictions, and a
man will also be able to receive all benedictions, from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus by
performing this particular type of vrata, a man and a woman in Krsna consciousness will be happy in this
material world, and because of being Krsna conscious they will be promoted to the spiritual world.

If an unmarried girl observes this vrata, she will be able to get a very good husband. If a woman who is
avira--who has no husband or son--executes this ritualistic ceremony, she can be promoted to the
spiritual world. A woman whose children have died after birth can get a child with a long duration of life
and also become very fortunate in possessing wealth. If a woman is unfortunate she will become
fortunate, and if ugly she will become beautiful. By observing this vrata, a diseased man can gain relief
from his disease and have an able body with which to work. If one recites this narration while offering
oblations to the pitas and demigods, especially during the sraddha ceremony, the demigods and
inhabitants of Pitrloka will be extremely pleased with him and bestow upon him the fulfillment of all
desires. After one performs this ritualistic ceremony, Lord Visnu and His wife, mother Laksmi, the
goddess of fortune, are very pleased with him. O King Pariksit, now I have completely described how Diti
performed this ceremony and had good children--the Maruts--and a happy life. I have tried to explain this
to you as elaborately as possible.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "performing the Pumsavana Ritualistic Ceremony."
