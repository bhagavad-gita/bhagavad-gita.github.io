<h2>Text</h2>
aho bataty-adbhutam esa raksasa
balo nivrttim gamito 'bhyagat punah
himsrah sva-papena vihimsitah khalah
sadhuh samatvena bhayad vimucyate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--alas; bata--indeed; ati--very much; adbhutam--this incident is wonderfully astonishing; esah--this (child);
raksasa--by the man-eating demon; balah--the innocent child Krsna; nivrttim--taken away just to be killed and
eaten; gamitah--went away; abhyagat punah--but He has come back again unhurt; himsrah--one who is envious;
sva-papena--because of his own sinful activities; vihimsitah--now (that demon) has been killed; khalah--because he
was envious and polluted; sadhuh--any person who is innocent and free from sinful life; samatvena--being equal to
everyone; bhayat--from all kinds of fear; vimucyate--becomes relieved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It is most astonishing that although this innocent child was taken away by the Raksasa to be eaten, He has
returned without having been killed or even injured. Because this demon was envious, cruel and sinful, he has
been killed for his own sinful activities. This is the law of nature. An innocent devotee is always protected by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a sinful person is always vanquished for his sinful life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna conscious life means innocent devotional life, and a sadhu is one who is fully devoted to Krsna. As
confirmed by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (9.30), bhajate mam ananya-bhak sadhur eva sa mantavyah: anyone fully
attached to Krsna is a sadhu. Nanda Maharaja and the gopis and other cowherd men could not understand that
Krsna was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a human child and that His life was not in danger under
any circumstances. Rather, because of their intense parental love for Krsna, they thought that Krsna was an
innocent child and had been saved by the Supreme Lord.
In the material world, because of intense lust and desire for enjoyment, one becomes implicated in sinful life
more and more (kama esa krodha esa rajo-guna-samudbhavah). Therefore the quality of fear is one of the aspects
of material life (ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunam ca). But if one becomes Krsna conscious, the process of devotional
service, sravanam kirtanam, diminishes one's polluted life of material existence, and one is purified and protected
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah. In devotional life,
one has faith in this process. Such faith is one of the six kinds of surrender. Raksisyatiti visvasah (Hari-bhaktivilasa
11.676). One of the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on Krsna, convinced that He
will give one all protection. That Krsna will protect His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Maharaja and the other
inhabitants of Vrndavana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that the Supreme Lord Himself
was present before them. There have been many instances in which a devotee like Prahlada Maharaja or Dhruva
Maharaja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved under all circumstances. Therefore our
only business is to become Krsna conscious and depend fully on Krsna for all protection.
