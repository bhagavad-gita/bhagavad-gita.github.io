<h2>Text</h2>
ita ete 'tra kutratya
man-maya-mohitetare
tavanta eva tatrabdam
kridanto visnuna samam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
itah--for this reason; ete--these boys with their calves; atra--here; kutratyah--where have they come from; matmaya-
mohita-itare--different from those who were mystified by my illusory potency; tavantah--the same number of
boys; eva--indeed; tatra--there; a-abdam--for one year; kridantah--are playing; visnuna samam--along with Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with Krsna for one whole year, yet they are different from
the ones illusioned by my mystic potency. Who are they? Where did they come from?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although appearing like calves, cows and cowherd boys, these were all Visnu. Actually they were visnu-tattva,
not jiva-tattva. Brahma was surprised. "The original cowherd boys and cows," he thought, "are still where I put
them last year. So who is it that is now keeping company with Krsna exactly as before? Where have they come
from?" Brahma was surprised that his mystic power had been neglected. Without touching the original cows and
cowherd boys kept by Brahma, Krsna had created another assembly of calves and boys, who were all expansions of
visnu-tattva. Thus Brahma's mystic power was superseded.
