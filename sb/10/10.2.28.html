<h2>Text</h2>
tvam eka evasya satah prasutis
tvam sannidhanam tvam anugrahas ca
tvan-mayaya samvrta-cetasas tvam
pasyanti nana na vipascito ye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvam--You (O Lord); ekah--being one without a second, You are everything; eva--indeed; asya satah--of this
cosmic manifestation now visible; prasutih--the original source; tvam--Your Lordship; sannidhanam--the
conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam--Your Lordship; anugrahah ca--and the
maintainer; tvat-mayaya--by Your illusory, external energy; samvrta-cetasah--those whose intelligence is covered by
such illusory energy; tvam--unto You; pasyanti--observe; nana--many varieties; na--not; vipascitah--learned
scholars or devotees; ye--who are.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord.
You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is
conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is
not the vision of learned devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and even Visnu, are supposed to be the creator,
maintainer and annihilator of this material world, but actually they are not. The fact is that everything is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. Ekam evadvitiyam brahma. There is no second
existence. Those who are truly vipascit, learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and
observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti (Brahma-samhita 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as
representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as
distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this
material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another
feature of the Lord. Tat te'nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag. 10.14.8). A devotee, therefore, regards distress as a
great favor of the Lord because he understands that he is being cleansed of contamination. Tesam aham
samuddharta mrtyu-samsara-sagarat (Bg. 12.7). The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give
the devotee relief from this material world, which is called mrtyu-samsara, or the constant repetition of birth and
death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by
offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is
vipascit, or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another
feature of the Lord. Sarvam khalv idam brahma. A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and no second entity. Ekam evadvitiyam. There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in
different energies.
Persons who are not in real knowledge think that Brahma is the creator, Visnu the maintainer and Siva the
annihilator and that the different demigods are intended to fulfill diverse purposes. Thus they create diverse
purposes and worship various demigods to have these purposes fulfilled (kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante
'nya-devatah). A devotee, however, knows that these various demigods are but different parts of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and that these parts need not be worshiped. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devata bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered
without true understanding." There is no need to worship the demigods, for this is avidhi, not in order. Simply by
surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of Krsna, one can completely discharge one's duties; there is no need to
worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the mudhas, fools, who are
bewildered by the three modes of material nature (tribhir gunamayair bhavair ebhih sarvam idam jagat). Such fools
cannot understand that the real source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (mohitam nabhijanati
mam ebhyah param avyayam). Not being disturbed by the Lord's various features, one should concentrate upon
and worship the Supreme Lord (mam ekam saranam vraja). This should be the guiding principle of one's life.
