<h2>Text</h2>
tad aham mattayor madhvya
varunya sri-madandhayoh
tamo-madam harisyami
strainayor ajitatmanoh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; aham--I; mattayoh--of these two drunken persons; madhvya--by drinking liquor; varunya--named
Varuni; sri-mada-andhayoh--who are blinded by celestial opulence; tamah-madam--this false prestige due to the
mode of ignorance; harisyami--I shall take away; strainayoh--because they have become so attached to women;
ajita-atmanoh--being unable to control the senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, since these two persons, drunk with the liquor named Varuni, or Madhvi, and unable to control their
senses, have been blinded by the pride of celestial opulence and have become attached to women, I shall relieve
them of their false prestige.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a sadhu chastises or punishes someone, he does not do so for revenge. Maharaja Pariksit had inquired why
Narada Muni was subject to such a spirit of revenge (tamah). But this was not tamah, for Narada Muni, in full
knowledge of what was for the good of the two brothers, wisely thought of how to cure them. Vaisnavas are good
physicians. They know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never in tamo-guna. Sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg. 14.26). Vaisnavas are always situated on the transcendental platform,
the Brahman platform. They cannot be subject to mistakes or the influence of the modes of material nature.
Whatever they do, after full consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to Godhead.
