<h2>Translation</h2>
Krsna, at that time, was sitting on an upside-down wooden mortar for grinding spices and was distributing milk
preparations such as yogurt and butter to the monkeys as He liked. Because of having stolen, He was looking all
around with great anxiety, suspecting that He might be chastised by His mother. Mother Yasoda, upon seeing Him,
very cautiously approached Him from behind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mother Yasoda was able to trace Krsna by following His butter-smeared footprints. She saw that Krsna was
stealing butter, and thus she smiled. Meanwhile, the crows also entered the room and came out in fear. Thus
mother Yasoda found Krsna stealing butter and very anxiously looking here and there.
