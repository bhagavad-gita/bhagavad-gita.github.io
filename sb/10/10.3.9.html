<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
ucur avyavasita-matin
gopan gopis ca balakah
rudatanena padena
ksiptam etan na samsayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ucuh--said; avyavasita-matin--who had lost all intelligence in the present situation; gopan--to the cowherd men;
gopih ca--and to the ladies; balakah--the children; rudata anena--as soon as the child cried; padena--with one leg;
ksiptam etat--this cart was dashed apart and immediately fell dismantled; na samsayah--there is no doubt about it.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The assembled cowherd men and ladies began to contemplate how this thing had happened. "Is it the work of
some demon or evil planet?" they asked. At that time, the small children present asserted that the cart had been
kicked apart by the baby Krsna. As soon as the crying baby bad kicked the cart's wheel, the cart had collapsed.
There was no doubt about it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have heard of people's being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a
gross body to stay in and haunt. The Sakatasura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking
for the opportunity to do mischief to Krsna. When Krsna kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the
ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was
possible for Krsna because He has full potency, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.32):
angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti
pasyanti panti kalayanti ciram jaganti
ananda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Krsna's body is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, or ananda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha. That is, any of the parts of His anandacinmaya
body can act for any other part. Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire these potencies; He already has them. Thus Krsna kicked
His little legs, and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have
been injured in many ways, but because Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling
of the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is ananda-cinmaya-rasa, full transcendental bliss.
Thus Krsna factually enjoyed.
The nearby children saw that actually Krsna had kicked the wheel of the cart and this was how the accident
happened. By the arrangement of yogamaya, all the gopis and gopas thought that the accident had taken place
because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything was done by Krsna and enjoyed by Him. Those
who enjoy the activities of Krsna are also on the platform of ananda-cinmaya-rasa; they are liberated from the
material platform. When one develops the practice of hearing krsna-katha, he is certainly transcendental to
material existence, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). Unless one is
on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the transcendental activities of Krsna; or in other words, whoever
engages in hearing the transcendental activities of Krsna is not on the material platform, but on the transcendental,
spiritual platform.
