<h2>Translation</h2>
All those personalities had four arms, holding conchshell, disc, mace and lotus flower in Their hands. They wore
helmets on Their heads, earrings on Their ears and garlands of forest flowers around Their necks. On the upper
portion of the right side of Their chests was the emblem of the goddess of fortune. Furthermore, They wore armlets
on Their arms, the Kaustubha gem around Their necks, which were marked with three lines like a conchshell, and
bracelets on Their wrists. With bangles on Their ankles, ornaments on Their feet, and sacred belts around Their
waists, They all appeared very beautiful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All the Visnu forms had four arms, with conchshell and other articles, but these characteristics are also possessed
by those who have attained sarupya-mukti in Vaikuntha and who consequently have forms exactly like the form of
the Lord. However, these Visnu forms appearing before Lord Brahma also possessed the mark of Srivatsa and the
Kaustubha gem, which are special characteristics possessed only by the Supreme Lord Himself. This proves that all
these boys and calves were in fact directly expansions of Visnu, the Personality of Godhead, not merely His
associates of Vaikuntha. Visnu Himself is included within Krsna. All the opulences of Visnu are already present in
Krsna, and consequently for Krsna to demonstrate so many Visnu forms was actually not very astonishing.
The Srivatsa mark is described by the Vaisnava-tosani as being a curl of fine yellow hair on the upper portion of
the right side of Lord Visnu's chest. This mark is not for ordinary devotees. It is a special mark of Visnu or Krsna.
