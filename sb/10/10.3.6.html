<h2>Text</h2>
autthanikautsukya-mana manasvini
samagatan pujayati vrajaukasah
naivasrnod vai ruditam sutasya sa
rudan stanarthi caranav udaksipat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
autthanika-autsukya-manah--mother Yasoda was very busy celebrating the utthana ceremony of her child;
manasvini--very liberal in distributing food, clothing, ornaments and cows, according to necessity; samagatan--to
the assembled guests; pujayati--just to satisfy them; vraja-okasah--to the inhabitants of Vraja; na--not; eva--
certainly; asrnot--did hear; vai--indeed; ruditam--the crying; sutasya--of her child; sa--mother Yasoda; rudan--
crying; stana-arthi--Krsna, who was hankering to drink His mother's milk by sucking her breast; caranau
udaksipat--out of anger, threw His two legs hither and thither.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The liberal mother Yasoda, absorbed in celebrating the utthana ceremony, was busy receiving guests, worshiping
them with all respect and offering them clothing, cows, garlands and grains. Thus she could not hear the child
crying for His mother. At that time, the child Krsna, demanding to drink the milk of His mother's breast, angrily
threw His legs upward.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna had been placed underneath a household handcart, but this handcart was actually another form of the
Sakatasura, a demon who had come there to kill the child. Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His mother's
breast, Krsna took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He kicked Sakatasura just to expose him. Although
Krsna's mother was engaged in receiving guests, Lord Krsna wanted to draw her attention by killing the Sakatasura,
and therefore he kicked that cart-shaped demon. Such are the pastimes of Krsna. Krsna wanted to draw the
attention of His mother, but while doing so He created a great havoc not understandable by ordinary persons.
These narrations are wonderfully enjoyable, and those who are fortunate are struck with wonder upon hearing of
these extraordinary activities of the Lord. Although the less intelligent regard them as mythological because a dull
brain cannot understand them, they are real facts. These narrations are actually so enjoyable and enlightening that
Maharaja Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami took pleasure in them, and other liberated persons, following in their
footsteps, become fully jubilant by hearing about the wonderful activities of the Lord.
