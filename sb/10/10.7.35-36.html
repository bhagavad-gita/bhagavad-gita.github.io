<h2>Translation</h2>
O King Pariksit, when the child Krsna was almost finished drinking His mother's milk and mother Yasoda was
touching Him and looking at His beautiful, brilliantly smiling face, the baby yawned, and mother Yasoda saw in His
mouth the whole sky, the higher planetary system and the earth, the luminaries in all directions, the sun, the
moon, fire, air, the seas, islands, mountains, rivers, forests, and all kinds of living entities, moving and nonmoving.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By the arrangement of yogamaya, Krsna's pastimes with mother Yasoda were all regarded as ordinary. So here was
an opportunity for Krsna to show His mother that the whole universe is situated within Him. In His small form,
Krsna was kind enough to show His mother the virat-rupa, the universal form, so that she could enjoy seeing what
kind of child she had on her lap. The rivers have been mentioned here as the daughters of the mountains (nagams
tad-duhitrh). It is the flowing of the rivers that makes big forests possible. There are living entities everywhere,
some of them moving and some of them not moving. No place is vacant. This is a special feature of God's creation.
