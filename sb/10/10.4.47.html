<h2>Text</h2>
pitarau nanvavindetam
krsnodararbhakehitam
gayanty adyapi kavayo
yal loka-samalapaham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pitarau--the actual father and mother of Krsna; na--not; anvavindetam--enjoyed; krsna--of Krsna; udara--
magnanimous; arbhaka-ihitam--the childhood pastimes He performed; gayanti--are glorifying; adya api--even
today; kavayah--great, great sages and saintly persons; yat--which is; loka-samala-apaham--by hearing of which the
contamination of the whole material world is vanquished.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although Krsna was so pleased with Vasudeva and Devaki that He descended as their son, they could not enjoy
Krsna's magnanimous childhood pastimes, which are so great that simply chanting about them vanquishes the
contamination of the material world. Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, however, enjoyed these pastimes fully, and
therefore their position is always better than that of Vasudeva and Devaki.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna actually took birth from the womb of Devaki, but just after His birth He was transferred to the home of
mother Yasoda. Devaki could not even have Krsna suck her breast. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja was astonished.
How had mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja become so fortunate that they enjoyed the complete childhood
pastimes of Krsna, which are still glorified by saintly persons? What had they done in the past by which they were
elevated to such an exalted position?
