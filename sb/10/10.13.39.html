<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Baladeva said, "O supreme controller! These boys are not great demigods, as I previously thought. Nor are
these calves great sages like Narada. Now I can see that You alone are manifesting Yourself in all varieties of
difference. Although one, You are existing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly explain this
to Me." Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva, Krsna explained the whole situation, and Baladeva
understood it.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Inquiring from Krsna about the actual situation, Lord Balarama said, "My dear Krsna, in the beginning I thought
that all these cows, calves and cowherd boys were either great sages and saintly persons or demigods, but at the
present it appears that they are actually Your expansions. They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves
and cows and boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other calves and cows and boys gone?
And why are You expanding Yourself as the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?" At
the request of Balarama, Krsna briefly explained the whole situation: how the calves and boys were stolen by
Brahma and how He was concealing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know that the
original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balarama understood, therefore, that this was not maya but Krsna's
opulence. Krsna has all opulences, and this was but another opulence of Krsna.
"At first," Lord Balarama said, "I thought that these boys and calves were a display of the power of great sages
like Narada, but now I see that all these boys and calves are You." After inquiring from Krsna, Lord Balarama
understood that Krsna Himself had become many. That the Lord can do this is stated in the Brahma-samhita
(5.33). Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam: although He is one, He can expand Himself in so many forms.
According to the Vedic version, ekam bahu syam: He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but
still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything is an expansion of Krsna; that is,
everything is an expansion either of Krsna Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent from the
potent, the potency and the potent are one (sakti-saktimatayor abhedah). The Mayavadis, however, say, cid-acitsamanvayah:
spirit and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (cit) is different from matter (acit), as
explained by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My separated
material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine,
which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Spirit
and matter cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies, yet the Mayavadis, or Advaitavadis,
try to make them one. This is wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one source,
they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things that come from our bodies, but although they come
from the same source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that although the supreme source is
one, the emanations from this source should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference
between the Mayavada and Vaisnava philosophies is that the Vaisnava philosophy recognizes this fact. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu's philosophy, therefore, is called acintya-bhedabheda--simultaneous oneness and difference. For
example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire.
Nonetheless, although we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although they are one, they are
different.
