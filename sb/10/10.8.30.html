<h2>Text</h2>
drstvatha tat-sneha-vaso 'smrtatma
sa go-vrajo 'tyatmapa-durga-margah

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
drstva--when the cows saw their calves below; atha--thereafter; tat-sneha-vasah--because of increased love for the
calves; asmrta-atma--as if they had forgotten themselves; sah--that; go-vrajah--herd of cows; ati-atma-pa-durgamargah--
escaping their caretakers because of increased affection for the calves, although the way was very rough
and hard; dvi-pat--pairs of legs together; kakut-grivah--their humps moving with their necks; udasya-pucchah--
raising their heads and tails; agat--came; hunkrtaih--lowing very loudly; asru-payah--with milk flowing from the
nipples; javena--very forcibly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the cows saw their own calves from the top of Govardhana Hill, they forgot themselves and their
caretakers because of increased affection, and although the path was very rough, they ran toward their calves with
great anxiety, each running as if with one pair of legs. Their milk bags full and flowing with milk, their heads and
tails raised, and their humps moving with their necks, they ran forcefully until they reached their calves to feed
them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally the calves and cows are pastured separately. The elderly men take care of the cows, and the small
children see to the calves. This time, however, the cows immediately forgot their position as soon as they saw the
calves below Govardhana Hill, and they ran with great force, their tails erect and their front and hind legs joined,
until they reached their calves.
