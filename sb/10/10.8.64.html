<h2>Translation</h2>
Then, rising very gradually and wiping his two eyes, Lord Brahma looked up at Mukunda. Lord Brahma, his head
bent low, his mind concentrated and his body trembling, very humbly began, with faltering words, to offer praises
to Lord Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma, being very joyful, began to shed tears, and he washed the lotus feet of Krsna with his tears. Repeatedly
he fell and rose as he recalled the wonderful activities of the Lord. After repeating obeisances for a long time,
Brahma stood up and smeared his hands over his eyes. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that the
word locane indicates that with his two hands he wiped the two eyes on each of his four faces. Seeing the Lord
before him, Brahma began to offer prayers with great humility, respect and attention.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Stealing of the Boys and Calves by Brahma."
HDG A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada
