<h2>Text</h2>
devakya jathare garbham

tat sannikrsya rohinya
udare sannivesaya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devakyah--of Devaki; jathare--within the womb; garbham--the embryo; sesa-akhyam--known as Sesa, the plenary
expansion of Krsna; dhama--the plenary expansion; mamakam--of Me; tat--Him; sannikrsya--attracting; rohinyah--
of Rohini; udare--within the womb; sannivesaya--transfer without difficulty.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Within the womb of Devaki is My partial plenary expansion known as Sankarsana or Sesa. Without difficulty,
transfer Him into the womb of Rohini.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The first plenary expansion of Krsna is Baladeva, also known as Sesa. The Sesa incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead supports the entire universe, and the eternal mother of this incarnation is mother Rohini.
"Because I am going into the womb of Devaki," the Lord told Yogamaya, "the Sesa incarnation has already gone
there and made suitable arrangements so that I may live there. Now He should enter the womb of Rohini, His
eternal mother."
In this connection, one may ask how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated
transcendentally, could enter the womb of Devaki, which had previously been entered by the six asuras, the sadgarbhas.
Does this mean that the Sad-garbhasuras were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.
The entire creation, as well as its individual parts, is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore, even though the Lord enters the material world, He does not do so. This is explained by the
Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.4-5):
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
na ca mat-sthani bhutani
pasya me yogam aisvaram
bhuta-bhrn na ca bhuta-stho
mamatma bhuta-bhavanah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer
of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, My Self is the very source of creation." Sarvam khalv idam
brahma. Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the
Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can
be explained only through the acintya-bhedabheda philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless
one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi
tattvatah: "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." Even though the Lord
cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the sastras.
A pure devotee is always transcendentally situated because of executing nine different processes of bhakti-yoga
(sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam).
Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a
devotee always fears, "Because I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me."
Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association.
Symbolically, mother Devaki's constant fear of Kamsa was purifying her. A pure devotee should always fear
material association, and in this way all the asuras of material association will be killed, as the sad-garbhasuras
were killed by Kamsa. It is said that from the mind, Marici appears. In other words, Marici is an incarnation of the
mind. Marici has six sons: Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Matsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness
and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the
Vedas: bhaktir evainam darsayati. Only bhakti can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devaki, and therefore Devaki symbolically
represents bhakti, and Kamsa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material
association, his real position of bhakti is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment.
When the six sons of Marici are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb
of bhakti the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devaki signifies the
appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and
Matsarya are killed, the Sesa incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural Krsna consciousness, Lord Krsna appears. This is the
explanation given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.
