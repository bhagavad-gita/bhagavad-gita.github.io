<h2>Translation</h2>
Vasudeva then saw the newborn child, who had very wonderful lotuslike eyes and who bore in His four hands
the four weapons sankha, cakra, gada and padma. On His chest was the mark of Srivatsa and on His neck the
brilliant Kaustubha gem. Dressed in yellow, His body blackish like a dense cloud, His scattered hair fully grown,
and His helmet and earrings sparkling uncommonly with the valuable gem Vaidurya, the child, decorated with a
brilliant belt, armlets, bangles and other ornaments, appeared very wonderful.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To support the word adbhutam, meaning "wonderful," the decorations and opulences of the newborn child are
fully described. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.30), barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam: the hue of
the Lord's beautiful form resembles the blackish color of dense clouds (asita means "blackish," and ambuda means
"cloud"). It is clear from the word catur-bhujam that Krsna first appeared with four hands, as Lord Visnu. No
ordinary child in human society has ever been born with four hands. And when is a child born with fully grown
hair? The descent of the Lord, therefore, is completely distinct from the birth of an ordinary child. The Vaidurya
gem, which sometimes appears bluish, sometimes yellow and sometimes red, is available in Vaikunthaloka. The
Lord's helmet and earrings were decorated with this particular gem.
