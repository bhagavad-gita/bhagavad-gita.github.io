<h2>Translation</h2>
When both of you were ordered by Lord Brahma to create progeny, you first underwent severe austerities by
controlling your senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an instruction about how to use one's senses to create progeny. According to Vedic principles, before
creating progeny one must fully control the senses. This control takes place through the garbhadhana-samskara. In
India there is great agitation for birth control in various mechanical ways, but birth cannot be mechanically
controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.9), janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam: birth, death, old
age and disease are certainly the primary distresses of the material world. People are trying to control birth, but
they are not able to control death; and if one cannot control death, one cannot control birth either. In other words,
artificially controlling birth is not any more feasible than artificially controlling death.
According to Vedic civilization, procreation should not be contrary to religious principles, and then the birthrate
will be controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo'smi: sex not contrary to
religious principles is a representation of the Supreme Lord. People should be educated in how to give birth to
good children through samskaras, beginning with the garbhadhana-samskara; birth should not be controlled by
artificial means, for this will lead to a civilization of animals. If one follows religious principles, he automatically
practices birth control because if one is spiritually educated he knows that the after-effects of sex are various types
of misery (bahu-duhkha-bhaja). One who is spiritually advanced does not indulge in uncontrolled sex. Therefore,
instead of being forced to refrain from sex or refrain from giving birth to many children, people should be
spiritually educated, and then birth control will automatically follow.
If one is determined to make spiritual advancement, he will not beget a child unless able to make that child a
devotee. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.18), pita na sa syat: one should not become a father unless one is
able to protect his child from mrtyu, the path of birth and death. But where is there education about this? A
responsible father never begets children like cats and dogs. Instead of being encouraged to adopt artificial means of
birth control, people should be educated in Krsna consciousness because only then will they understand their
responsibility to their children. If one can beget children who will be devotees and be taught to turn aside from the
path of birth and death (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani), there is no need of birth control. Rather, one should be
encouraged to beget children. Artificial means of birth control have no value. Whether one begets children or does
not, a population of men who are like cats and dogs will never make human society happy. It is therefore necessary
for people to be educated spiritually so that instead of begetting children like cats and dogs, they will undergo
austerities to produce devotees. This will make their lives successful.
