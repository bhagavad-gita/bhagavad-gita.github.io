<h2>Translation</h2>
When Vasudeva saw his extraordinary son, his eyes were struck with wonder. In transcendental jubilation, he
mentally collected ten thousand cows and distributed them among the brahmanas as a transcendental festival.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has analyzed the wonder of Vasudeva upon seeing his extraordinary child.
Vasudeva was shivering with wonder to see a newborn child decorated so nicely with valuable garments and gems.
He could immediately understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had appeared, not as an ordinary child
but in His original, fully decorated, four-handed form. The first wonder was that the Lord was not afraid to appear
within the prison house of Kamsa, where Vasudeva and Devaki were interned. Second, although the Lord, the
Supreme Transcendence, is all-pervading, He had appeared from the womb of Devaki. The third point of wonder,
therefore, was that a child could take birth from the womb so nicely decorated. Fourth, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was Vasudeva's worshipable Deity yet had taken birth as his son. For all these reasons, Vasudeva was
transcendentally jubilant, and he wanted to perform a festival, as ksatriyas do to celebrate the birth of a child, but
because of his imprisonment he was unable to do it externally, and therefore he performed the festival within his
mind. This was just as good. If one cannot externally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can serve the
Lord within one's mind, since the activities of the mind are as good as those of the other senses. This is called the
nondual or absolute situation (advaya jnana). People generally perform ritualistic ceremonies for the birth of a
child. Why then should Vasudeva not have performed such a ceremony when the Supreme Lord appeared as his
son?
