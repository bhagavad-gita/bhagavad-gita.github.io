nidhaya--placing; tat-sutam--her daughter; upadaya--picking up; punah--again; grhan--to his own house; agat--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Vasudeva reached the house of Nanda Maharaja, he saw that all the cowherd men were fast asleep. Thus
he placed his own son on the bed of Yasoda, picked up her daughter, an expansion of Yogamaya, and then returned
to his residence, the prison house of Kamsa.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vasudeva knew very well that as soon as the daughter was in the prison house of Kamsa, Kamsa would
immediately kill her; but to protect his own child, he had to kill the child of his friend. Nanda Maharaja was his
friend, but out of deep affection and attachment for his own son, he knowingly did this. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that one cannot be blamed for protecting one's own child at the sacrifice of another's. Furthermore,
Vasudeva cannot be accused of callousness, since his actions were impelled by the force of Yogamaya.
