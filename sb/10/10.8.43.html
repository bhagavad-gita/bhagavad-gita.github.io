<h2>Text</h2>
evam etesu bhedesu
ciram dhyatva sa atma-bhuh
satyah ke katare neti
jnatum neste kathancana
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this way; etesu bhedesu--between these boys, who were existing separately; ciram--for a long time;
dhyatva--after thinking; sah--he; atma-bhuh--Lord Brahma; satyah--real; ke--who; katare--who; na--are not; iti--
thus; jnatum--to understand; na--not; iste--was able; kathancana--in any way at all.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus Lord Brahma, thinking and thinking for a long time, tried to distinguish between those two sets of boys,
who were each separately existing. He tried to understand who was real and who was not real, but he couldn't
understand at all.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma was puzzled. "The original boys and calves are still sleeping as I have kept them," he thought, "but
another set is here playing with Krsna. How has this happened?" Brahma could not grasp what was happening.
Which boys were real, and which were not real? Brahma was unable to come to any definite conclusion. He
pondered the matter for a long while. "How can there be two sets of calves and boys at the same time? Have the
boys and calves here been created by Krsna, or has Krsna created the ones lying asleep? Or are both merely
creations of Krsna?" Brahma thought about the subject in many different ways. "After I go to the cave and see that
the boys and calves are still there, does Krsna go take them away and put them here so that I come here and see
them, and does Krsna then take them from here and put them there?" Brahma could not figure out how there
could be two sets of calves and cowherd boys exactly alike. Although thinking and thinking, he could not
understand at all.
