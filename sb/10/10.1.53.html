<h2>Text</h2>
prasanna-vadanambhojo
nrsamsam nirapatrapam
manasa duyamanena
vihasann idam abravit
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prasanna-vadana-ambhojah--Vasudeva, who externally presented himself as if very happy; nrsamsam--unto the
most cruel; nirapatrapam--shameless Kamsa; manasa--with the mind; duyamanena--which was full of anxiety and
sorrow; vihasan--smiling externally; idam abravit--and spoke as follows.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Vasudeva's mind was full of anxiety because his wife was facing danger, but in order to please the cruel,
shameless and sinful Kamsa, he externally smiled and spoke to him as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes one must act duplicitously in a dangerous position, as Vasudeva did to save his wife. The material
world is complicated, and to execute one's duties, one cannot avoid adopting such diplomacy. Vasudeva did
everything possible to save his wife for the sake of begetting Krsna. This indicates that one may act duplicitously
for the purpose of saving Krsna and His interests. According to the arrangement already foretold, Krsna was to
appear through Vasudeva and Devaki to kill Kamsa. Vasudeva, therefore, had to do everything to save the situation.
Although all the events were prearranged by Krsna, a devotee must try his best to serve the purpose of Krsna. Krsna
Himself is all-powerful, but it is not that a devotee should therefore sit idly and leave everything to Him. This
instruction is also found in Bhagavad-gita. Although Krsna was doing everything for Arjuna, Arjuna never sat down
idly as a nonviolent gentleman. Rather, he tried his best to fight the battle and be victorious.
