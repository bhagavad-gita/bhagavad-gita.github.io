<h2>Text</h2>
yasoda nanda-patni ca
jatam param abudhyata
na tal-lingam parisranta
nidrayapagata-smrtih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasoda--Yasoda, Krsna's mother in Gokula; nanda-patni--the wife of Nanda Maharaja; ca--also; jatam--a child was
born; param--the Supreme Person; abudhyata--could understand; na--not; tat-lingam--whether the child was male
or female; parisranta--because of too much labor; nidraya--when overwhelmed with sleep; apagata-smrtih--having
lost consciousness.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Exhausted by the labor of childbirth, Yasoda was overwhelmed with sleep and unable to understand what kind of
child had been born to her.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva were intimate friends, and so were their wives, Yasoda and Devaki. Although their
names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devaki was able
to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into Krsna,
whereas Yasoda was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Yasoda was such an advanced
devotee that she never regarded Krsna as the Supreme personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own
child. Devaki, however, knew from the very beginning that although Krsna was her son, He was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In Vrndavana, no one regarded Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When
something very wonderful happened because of Krsna's activities, the inhabitants of Vrndavana--the cowherd men,
the cowherd boys, Nanda Maharaja, Yasoda and the others--were surprised, but they never considered their son
Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there
as Krsna. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of Krsna and intensely loves
the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position. This is called kevala-bhakti and is
distinct from the stages of jnana and jnanamayi bhakti.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Birth of Lord Krsna."
Chapter Four
The Atrocities of King Kamsa
This chapter describes how Kamsa, following the advice of his demoniac friends, considered the persecution of
small children to be very diplomatic.
After Vasudeva bound himself with iron shackles as before, all the doors of the prison house closed by the
influence of Yogamaya, who then began crying as a newborn child, This crying awakened the doorkeepers, who
immediately informed Kamsa that a child had been born to Devaki. Upon hearing this news, Kamsa appeared with
great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devaki's pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly
snatched the child from Devaki's hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for Kamsa, however, the
newborn child slipped away from his hands, rose above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of Durga.
Durga then told Kamsa, "The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to
persecute all the children will prove futile."
According to the prophecy, the eighth child of Devaki would kill Kamsa, and therefore when Kamsa saw that the
eighth child was a female and heard that his so-called enemy had taken birth elsewhere, he was struck with
wonder. He decided to release Devaki and Vasudeva, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities.
Falling at the feet of Devaki and Vasudeva, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the
events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of
their children. Devaki and Vasudeva, being naturally very pious, immediately excused Kamsa for his atrocities, and
Kamsa, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home.
After the night passed, however, Kamsa called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The
ministers, who were all demons, advised Kamsa that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all
the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Kamsa's kingdom should be killed. Although the
demigods always feared Kamsa, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, Kamsa should try his
best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that Kamsa and the demons continue their
enmity toward Visnu because Visnu is the original person among all the demigods. The brahmanas, the cows, the
Vedas, austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts
of the body of Visnu, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Therefore, the
ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the brahmanas should be systematically
persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, Kamsa approved of their
instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the brahmanas. Following Kamsa's orders, therefore, the
demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabhumi.
