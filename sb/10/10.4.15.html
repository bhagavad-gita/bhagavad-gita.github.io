<h2>Text</h2>
tad dama badhyamanasya
svarbhakasya krtagasah
dvy-angulonam abhut tena
sandadhe 'nyac ca gopika
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat dama--that binding rope; badhyamanasya--who was being bound by mother Yasoda; sva-arbhakasya--of her
own son; krta-agasah--who was an offender; dvi-angula--by a measurement of two fingers; unam--short; abhut--
became; tena--with that rope; sandadhe--joined; anyat ca--another rope; gopika--mother Yasoda.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When mother Yasoda was trying to bind the offending child, she saw that the binding rope was short by a
distance the width of two fingers. Thus she brought another rope to join to it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is the first chapter in Krsna's exhibition of unlimited potency to mother Yasoda when she tried to bind Him:
the rope was too short. The Lord had already shown His unlimited potency by killing Putana, Sakatasura and
Trnavarta. Now Krsna exhibited another vibhuti, or display of potency, to mother Yasoda. "Unless I agree," Krsna
desired to show, "you cannot bind Me." Thus although mother Yasoda, in her attempt to bind Krsna, added one
rope after another, ultimately she was a failure. When Krsna agreed, however, she was successful. In other words,
one must be in transcendental love with Krsna, but that does not mean that one can control Krsna. When Krsna is
satisfied with one's devotional service, He does everything Himself. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty
adah. He reveals more and more to the devotee as the devotee advances in service. Jihvadau: this service begins
with the tongue, with chanting and with taking the prasada of Krsna.
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234)
