<h2>Text</h2>
tan drstva bhaya-santrastan
uce krsno 'sya bhi-bhayam
mitrany asan ma viramatehanesye
vatsakan aham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan--that those calves were going away; drstva--seeing; bhaya-santrastan--to the cowherd boys, who were
disturbed by fear that within the dense forest the calves would be attacked by some ferocious animals; uce--Krsna
said; krsnah asya bhi-bhayam--Krsna, who is Himself the fearful element of all kinds of fear (when Krsna is
present, there is no fear); mitrani--My dear friends; asat--from your enjoyment of eating; ma viramata--do not stop;
iha--in this place, in this spot; anesye--I shall bring back; vatsakan--the calves; aham--I.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Krsna saw that His friends the cowherd boys were frightened, He, the fierce controller even of fear itself,
said, just to mitigate their fear, "My dear friends, do not stop eating. I shall bring your calves back to this spot by
personally going after them Myself."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the presence of Krsna's friendship, a devotee cannot have any fear. Krsna is the supreme controller, the
controller of even death, which is supposed to be the ultimate fear in this material world. Bhayam
dvitiyabhinivesatah syat (Bhag. 11.2.37). This fear arises because of lack of Krsna consciousness; otherwise there
cannot be any fear. For one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, this material world of fear becomes
hardly dangerous at all.
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
Bhavambudhih, the material ocean of fear, becomes very easy to cross by the mercy of the supreme controller.
This material world, in which there is fear and danger at every step (padam padam yad vipadam), is not meant for
those who have taken shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. Such persons are delivered from this fearful world.
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
(Bhag. 10.14.58)
Everyone, therefore, should take shelter of the Supreme Person, who is the source of fearlessness, and thus be
secure.
