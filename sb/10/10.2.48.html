mrtyur buddhimatapohyo
yavad buddhi-balodayam
yady asau na nivarteta
naparadho 'sti dehinah
SYNONYMS
mrtyuh--death; buddhi-mata--by an intelligent person; apohyah--should be avoided; yavat--as long as; buddhibala-
udayam--intelligence and bodily strength are present; yadi--if; asau--that (death); na nivarteta--cannot be
checked; na--not; aparadhah--offense; asti--there is; dehinah--of the person in danger of death.
TRANSLATION
As long as he has intelligence and bodily strength, an intelligent person must try to avoid death. This is the duty
of every embodied person. But if death cannot be avoided in spite of one's endeavors, a person facing death
commits no offense.
PURPORT
It is natural for a person facing untimely death to try his best to save himself. This is one's duty. Although death
is sure, everyone should try to avoid it and not meet death without opposition because every living soul is by
nature eternal. Because death is a punishment imposed in the condemned life of material existence, the Vedic
culture is based on avoiding death (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti). Everyone should try to avoid death and
rebirth by cultivating spiritual life and should not submit to death without struggling to survive. One who is not
trying to stop death is not an intelligent human being. Because Devaki was face to face with imminent death, it was
Vasudeva's duty to save her, as he was trying his best to do. He therefore considered another way to approach
Kamsa so that Devaki would be saved.
TEXTS 49-50
pradaya mrtyave putran
mocaye krpanam imam
suta me yadi jayeran
mrtyur va na mriyeta cet
viparyayo va kim na syad
gatir dhatur duratyaya
upasthito nivarteta
nivrttah punar apatet
SYNONYMS
pradaya--promising to deliver; mrtyave--unto Kamsa, who is death personified for Devaki; putran--my sons;
mocaye--I am releasing her from imminent danger; krpanam--innocent; imam--Devaki; sutah--sons; me--my; yadi--
whether; jayeran--should take birth; mrtyuh--Kamsa; va--or; na--not; mriyeta--should die; cet--if; viparyayah--just
the opposite; va--or; kim--whether; na--not; syat--it may happen; gatih--the movement; dhatuh--of providence;
duratyaya--very difficult to understand; upasthitah--that which is presently obtained; nivarteta--may stop;
nivrttah--Devaki's death being stopped; punah apatet--in the future it may happen again (but what can I do).
TRANSLATION
Vasudeva considered: By delivering all my sons to Kamsa, who is death personified, I shall save the life of Devaki.
Perhaps Kamsa will die before my sons take birth, or, since he is already destined to die at the hands of my son,
one of my sons may kill him. For the time being, let me promise to hand over my sons so that Kamsa will give up
this immediate threat, and if in due course of time Kamsa dies, I shall have nothing to fear.
PURPORT
Vasudeva wanted to save the life of Devaki by promising to deliver his sons to Kamsa. "In the future," he
thought, "Kamsa may die, or I may not beget any sons. Even if a son is born and I deliver him to Kamsa, Kamsa
may die at his hands, for by providence anything could happen. It is very difficult to understand how things are
managed by providence." Thus Vasudeva decided that he would promise to deliver his sons to the hands of Kamsa
in order to save Devaki from the imminent danger of death.
