<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
sa viksya visvam sahasa
rajan sanjata-vepathuh
sammilya mrgasavaksi
netre asit suvismita
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa--mother Yasoda; viksya--by seeing; visvam--the whole universe; sahasa--suddenly within the mouth of her son;
rajan--O King (Maharaja Pariksit); sanjata-vepathuh--whose heart was beating; sammilya--opening; mrgasava-aksi--
like the eyes of a deer cub; netre--her two eyes; asit--became; su-vismita--astonished.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When mother Yasoda saw the whole universe within the mouth of her child, her heart began to throb, and in
astonishment she wanted to close her restless eyes.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because of her pure maternal love, mother Yasoda thought that this wonderful child playing so many tricks must
have had some disease. She did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to close her
eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes became restless like those of a deer cub. This was
all the arrangement of yogamaya. The relationship between mother Yasoda and Krsna is one of pure maternal love.
In that love, mother Yasoda did not very much appreciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's
opulences.
At the beginning of this chapter, two extra verses sometimes appear:
evam bahuni karmani
gopanam sam sa-yositam
nandasya gehe vavrdhe
kurvan visnu-janardanah
"In this way, to chastise and kill the demons, the child Krsna demonstrated many activities in the house of Nanda
Maharaja, and the inhabitants of Vraja enjoyed these incidents."
evam sa vavrdhe visnur
nanda-gehe janardanah
kurvann anisam anandam
gopalanam sa-yositam
"To increase the transcendental pleasure of the gopas and the gopis, Krsna, the killer of all demons, was thus
raised by His father and mother, Nanda and Yasoda."
Sripada Vijayadhvaja Tirtha also adds another verse after the third verse in this chapter:
vistareneha karunyat
sarva-papa-pranasanam
vaktum arhasi dharma-jna
dayalus tvam iti prabho
"Pariksit Maharaja then requested Sukadeva Gosvami to continue speaking such narrations about the pastimes of
Krsna, so that the King could enjoy from them transcendental bliss."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta."
Chapter Eight
Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form Within His Mouth
The summary of the Eighth Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes the ceremony of giving a name to Krsna.
It also describes His crawling, His playing with the cows, and His eating earth and again showing the universal
form to His mother.
One day, Vasudeva sent for Gargamuni, the family priest of the yadu-vamsa, and thus Gargamuni went to the
house of Nanda Maharaja, who received him very well and requested him to give names to Krsna and Balarama.
Gargamuni, of course, reminded Nanda Maharaja that Kamsa was looking for the son of Devaki and said that if he
performed the ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of Kamsa, who would then
suspect that Krsna was the son of Devaki. Nanda Maharaja therefore requested Gargamuni to perform this
ceremony without anyone's knowledge, and Gargamuni did so. Because Balarama, the son of Rohini, increases the
transcendental bliss of others, His name is Rama, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called Baladeva.
He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is Sankarsana. Krsna, the son of Yasoda,
previously appeared in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now assumed the color black.
Because He was sometimes the son of Vasudeva, His name is Vasudeva. According to His various activities and
qualities, He has many other names. After thus informing Nanda Maharaja and completing the name-giving
ceremony, Gargamuni advised Nanda Maharaja to protect his son very carefully and then departed.
Sukadeva Gosvami next described how the two children crawled, walked on Their small legs, played with the
cows and calves, stole butter and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he described many
naughty activities of Krsna and Balarama. The most wonderful of these occurred when Krsna's playmates
complained to mother Yasoda that Krsna was eating earth. Mother Yasoda wanted to open Krsna's mouth to see the
evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the
next moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all this to Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva
Gosvami, at Maharaja Pariksit's request, praised the fortune of mother Yasoda and Nanda. Nanda and Yasoda were
formerly Drona and Dhara, and by the order of Brahma they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as their son.
