<h2>Text</h2>
tamyam tamovan naiharam
khadyotarcir ivahani
mahatitara-mayaisyam
nihanty atmani yunjatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tamyam--on a dark night; tamah-vat--just as darkness; naiharam--produced by snow; khadyota-arcih--the light of
a glowworm; iva--just as; ahani--in the daytime, in the sunlight; mahati--in a great personality; itara-maya--inferior
mystic potency; aisyam--the ability; nihanti--destroys; atmani--in his own self; yunjatah--of the person who
attempts to use.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As the darkness of snow on a dark night and the light of a glowworm in the light of day have no value, the mystic
power of an inferior person who tries to use it against a person of great power is unable to accomplish anything;
instead, the power of that inferior person is diminished.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one wants to supersede a superior power, one's own inferior power becomes ludicrous. Just as a glowworm
in the daytime and snow at night have no value, Brahma's mystic power became worthless in the presence of Krsna,
for greater mystic power condemns inferior mystic power. On a dark night, the darkness produced by snow has no
meaning. The glowworm appears very important at night, but in the daytime its glow has no value; whatever little
value it has is lost. Similarly, Brahma became insignificant in the presence of Krsna's mystic power. Krsna's maya
was not diminished in value, but Brahma's maya was condemned. Therefore, one should not try to exhibit one's
insignificant opulence before a greater power.
