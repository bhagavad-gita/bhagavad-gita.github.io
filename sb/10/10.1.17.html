<h2>Text</h2>
sa bibhrat paurusam dhama
bhrajamano yatha ravih
durasado 'tidurdharso
bhutanam sambabhuva ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Vasudeva); bibhrat--carried; paurusam--pertaining to the Supreme Person; dhama--the spiritual
effulgence; bhrajamanah--illuminating; yatha--as; ravih--the sunshine; durasadah--very difficult even to look at,
difficult to understand by sensory perception; ati-durdharsah--approachable with great difficulty; bhutanam--of all
living entities; sambabhuva--so he became; ha--positively.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While carrying the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of his heart, Vasudeva bore the
Lord's transcendentally illuminating effulgence, and thus he became as bright as the sun. He was therefore very
difficult to see or approach through sensory perception. Indeed, he was unapproachable and unperceivable even for
such formidable men as Kamsa, and not only for Kamsa but for all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word dhama is significant. Dhama refers to the place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. In
the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.1) it is said, dhamna svena sada nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dhimahi.
In the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no influence of material energy (dhamna svena sada
nirasta-kuhakam). Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present by His name, form, qualities or
paraphernalia immediately becomes a dhama. For example, we speak of Vrndavana-dhama, Dvaraka-dhama and
Mathura-dhama because in these places the name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead are
always present. Similarly, if one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do something, the core of
his heart becomes a dhama, and thus he becomes so extraordinarily powerful that not only his enemies but also
people in general are astonished to observe his activities. Because he is unapproachable, his enemies are simply
struck with wonder, as explained here by the words durasado 'tidurdharsah.
The words paurusam dhama have been explained by various acaryas. Sri Viraraghava Acarya says that these
words refer to the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vijayadhvaja says that they signify visnutejas,
and Sukadeva says bhagavat-svarupa. The Vaisnava-tosani says that these words indicate the influence of the
Supreme Lord's effulgence, and Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that they signify the appearance of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
