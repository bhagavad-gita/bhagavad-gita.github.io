<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once when mother earth was overburdened by hundreds of thousands of military phalanxes of various conceited
demons dressed like kings, she approached Lord Brahma for relief.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the world is overburdened by unnecessary military arrangements and when various demoniac kings are
the executive heads of state, this burden causes the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I appear Myself." When the residents of this earth become atheistic and godless, they
descend to the status of animals like dogs and hogs, and thus their only business is to bark among themselves. This
is dharmasya glani, deviation from the goal of life. Human life is meant for attaining the highest perfection of Krsna
consciousness, but when people are godless and the presidents or kings are unnecessarily puffed up with military
power, their business is to fight and increase the military strength of their different states. Nowadays, therefore, it
appears that every state is busy manufacturing atomic weapons to prepare for a third world war. Such preparations
are certainly unnecessary; they reflect the false pride of the heads of state. The real business of a chief executive is
to see to the happiness of the mass of people by training them in Krsna consciousness in different divisions of life.
Catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg. 4.13). A leader should train the people as brahmanas,
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras and engage them in various occupational duties, thus helping them progress toward
Krsna consciousness. Instead, however, rogues and thieves in the guise of protectors arrange for a voting system,
and in the name of democracy they come to power by hook or crook and exploit the citizens. Even long, long ago,
asuras, persons devoid of God consciousness, became the heads of state, and now this is happening again. The
various states of the world are preoccupied with arranging for military strength. Sometimes they spend sixty-five
percent of the government's revenue for this purpose. But why should people's hard-earned money be spent in this
way? Because of the present world situation, Krsna has descended in the form of the Krsna consciousness
movement. This is quite natural, for without the Krsna consciousness movement the world cannot be peaceful and
happy.
