<h2>Text</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca
tvam eva purva-sarge 'bhuh
prsnih svayambhuve sati
tadayam sutapa nama
prajapatir akalmasah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said to Devaki; tvam--you; eva--indeed; purva-sarge--in
a previous millennium; abhuh--became; prsnih--by the name Prsni; svayambhuve--the millennium of Svayambhuva
Manu; sati--O supremely chaste; tada--at that time; ayam--Vasudeva; sutapa--Sutapa; nama--by the name;
prajapatih--a Prajapati; akalmasah--a spotlessly pious person.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: My dear mother, best of the chaste, in your previous birth, in the
Svayambhuva millennium, you were known as Prsni, and Vasudeva, who was the most pious Prajapati, was named
Sutapa.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead made it clear that Devaki had not become His mother only now; rather, she
had been His mother previously also. Krsna is eternal, and His selection of a father and mother from among His
devotees takes place eternally. Previously also, Devaki had been the Lord's mother and Vasudeva the Lord's father,
and they were named Prsni and Sutapa. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He accepts His eternal
father and mother, and they accept Krsna as their son. This pastime takes place eternally and is therefore called
nitya-lila. Thus there was no cause for surprise or ridicule. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita
(4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body,
take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One should try to understand
the appearance and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic authorities, not from
imagination. One who follows his imaginations about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is condemned.
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
(Bg. 9.11)
The Lord appears as the son of His devotee by His param bhavam. The word bhava refers to the stage of pure
love, which has nothing to do with material transactions.
