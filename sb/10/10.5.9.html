<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
hanyante pasavo yatra
nirdayair ajitatmabhih
manyamanair imam deham
ajaramrtyu nasvaram
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hanyante--are killed in many ways (especially by slaughterhouses); pasavah--four-legged animals (horses, sheep,
cows, hogs, etc.); yatra--wherein; nirdayaih--by those merciless persons who are conducted by the mode of passion;
ajita-atmabhih--rascals who are unable to control the senses; manyamanaih--are thinking; imam--this; deham--
body; ajara--will never become old or diseased; amrtyu--death will never come; nasvaram--although the body is
destined to be annihilated.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Unable to control their senses, rascals who are falsely proud of their riches or their birth in aristocratic families
are so cruel that to maintain their perishable bodies, which they think will never grow old or die, they kill poor
animals without mercy. Sometimes they kill animals merely to enjoy an excursion.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the modes of passion and ignorance increase in human society, giving rise to unnecessary economic
development, the result is that people become involved with wine, women and gambling. Then, being mad, they
maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however
one may try to maintain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease, such foolish rascals
engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being duskrtis, they completely forget the existence of the supreme
controller, who is sitting within the core of everyone's heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). That
supreme controller is observing every bit of one's activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by giving one a
suitable body made by material nature (bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya). In this way, sinful
persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that
when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth
will be finished with his next birth.
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
(Bhag. 5.5.4)
Animal killing is prohibited. Every living being, of course, has to eat something (jivo jivasya jivanam). But one
should be taught what kind of food one should take. Therefore the Isopanisad instructs, tena tyaktena bhunjithah:
one should eat whatever is allotted for human beings. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." A devotee, therefore, does
not eat anything that would require slaughterhouses for poor animals. Rather, devotees take prasada of Krsna (tena
tyaktena bhunjithah). Krsna recommends that one give Him patram puspam phalam toyam--a leaf, a Mower, fruit
or water. Animal food is never recommended for human beings; instead, a human being is recommended to take
prasada, remnants of food left by Krsna. Yajna-sistasinah santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaih (Bg. 3.13). If one practices
eating prasada, even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one becomes free from the results of sinful acts.
