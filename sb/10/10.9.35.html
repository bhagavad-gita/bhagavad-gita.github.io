SYNONYMS
vrajasya--of the herd of cows; ramah--Balarama; prema-rdheh--because of an increase of affection; viksya--after
observing; aut-kanthyam--attachment; anu-ksanam--constantly; mukta-stanesu--who had grown up and were no

understanding the reason; acintayat--began to consider as follows.
TRANSLATION
Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attachment even to those calves that were grown up
and had stopped sucking milk from their mothers. When Baladeva saw this attachment, He was unable to
understand the reason for it, and thus He began to consider as follows.
PURPORT
The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly
given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which
had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balarama
was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from Krsna about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were
actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were
expansions of Krsna. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of yogamaya. There are two
mayas working under the direction of Krsna--mahamaya, the energy of the material world, and yogamaya, the
energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of yogamaya.
From the very day on which Brahma stole the calves and boys, yogamaya acted in such a way that the residents of
Vrndavana, including even Lord Balarama, could not understand how yogamaya was working and causing such
uncommon things to happen. But as yogamaya gradually acted, Balarama in particular was able to understand what
was happening, and therefore He inquired from Krsna.
