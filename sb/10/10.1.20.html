<h2>Text</h2>
sa tvam tri-loka-sthitaye sva-mayaya

sargaya raktam rajasopabrmhitam
krsnam ca varnam tamasa janatyaye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah tvam--Your Lordship, who are the same person, the Transcendence; tri-loka-sthitaye--to maintain the three
worlds, the upper, middle and lower planetary systems; sva-mayaya--by Your personal energy (atma-mayaya);
bibharsi--assume; suklam--the white form of Visnu in goodness; khalu--as well as; varnam--color; atmanah--of the
same category as You (visnu-tattva); sargaya--for the creation of the entire world; raktam--the reddish color of rajoguna;
rajasa--with the quality of passion; upabrmhitam--being charged; krsnam ca--and the quality of darkness;
varnam--the color; tamasa--which is surrounded by ignorance; jana-atyaye--for the ultimate destruction of the
entire creation.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds,
You assume the white color of Visnu in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You
appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You
appear blackish.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vasudeva prayed to the Lord, "You are called suklam. Suklam, or 'whiteness,' is the symbolic representation of
the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahma is called rakta, or red, because
Brahma represents the qualities of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord Siva because he annihilates
the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your
potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities." As confirmed in the Vedas, harir hi nirgunah saksat:
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of
passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord.
In this verse, the three colors mentioned--sukla, rakta and krsna--are not to be understood literally, in terms of
what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. After
all, sometimes we see that a duck is white, although it is in tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic
called bakandha-nyaya, the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a
hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vyasadeva, however, the
compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in tamo-guna; rather, he is in the
highest position of sattva-guna, beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (sukla-raktas tatha
pitah) are used to designate the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras. Lord Ksirodakasayi Visnu is celebrated as
possessing a blackish color, Lord Siva is whitish, and Lord Brahma is reddish, but according to Srila Sanatana
Gosvami in the Vaisnava-tosani-tika, this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here.
The real understanding of sukla, rakta and krsna is as follows. The Lord is always transcendental, but for the sake
of creation He assumes the color rakta as Lord Brahma. Again, sometimes the Lord becomes angry. As He says in
Bhagavad-gita (16.19):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of
material existence, into various demoniac species of life." To destroy the demons, the Lord becomes angry, and
therefore He assumes the form of Lord Siva. In summary, the Supreme personality of Godhead is always beyond
the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception.
One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or mahajanas. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.3.28), ete camsa-kalah pumsah krsnas tu bhagavan svayam.
