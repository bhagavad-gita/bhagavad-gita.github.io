<h2>Text</h2>
ekadaroham arudham
lalayanti sutam sati
garimanam sisor vodhum
na sehe giri-kutavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekada--one time (estimated to have been when Krsna was one year old); aroham--on His mother's lap; arudham--
who was sitting; lalayanti--was patting; sutam--her son; sati--mother Yasoda; garimanam--because of an increase in
heaviness; sisoh--of the child; vodhum--to bear Him; na--not; sehe--was able; giri-kuta-vat--appearing like the
weight of a mountain peak.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One day, a year after Krsna's appearance, mother Yasoda was patting her son on her lap. But suddenly she felt the
child to be heavier than a mountain peak, and she could no longer bear His weight.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lalayanti. Sometimes a mother lifts her child, and when the child falls in her hands, the child laughs, and the
mother also enjoys pleasure. Yasoda used to do this, but this time Krsna became very heavy, and she could not bear
His weight. Under the circumstances, it is to be understood that Krsna was aware of the coming of Trnavartasura,
who would take Him far away from His mother. Krsna knew that when Trnavarta came and took Him away from
His mother's lap, mother Yasoda would be greatly bereaved. He did not want His mother to suffer any difficulty
from the demon. Therefore, because He is the source of everything (janmady asya yatah), He assumed the
heaviness of the entire universe. The child was on the lap of Yasoda, who was therefore in possession of everything
in the world, but when the child assumed such heaviness, she had to put Him down in order to give Trnavartasura
an opportunity to take Him away and play with Him for some time before the child returned to the lap of His
mother.
