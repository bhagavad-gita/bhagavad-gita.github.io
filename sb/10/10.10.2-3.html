<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King Pariksit, because the two sons of Kuvera had been elevated to the association of
Lord Siva, of which they were very much proud, they were allowed to wander in a garden attached to Kailasa Hill,
on the bank of the Mandakini River. Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called Varuni.
Accompanied by women singing after them, they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always rolling
in intoxication.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse mentions some of the material advantages afforded to persons associated with or devoted to Lord Siva.
Apart from Lord Siva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish
people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord Krsna in
Bhagavad-gita (7.20): kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah. Those who are not devotees of Krsna
have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and therefore they have been described as hrta jnana, bereft of sense.
The Krsna consciousness movement can very easily point out such foolish persons, for they have been indicated in
Bhagavad-gita (7.15), where Lord Krsna says:
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and
who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." Anyone who is not a devotee of Krsna
and does not surrender to Krsna must be considered naradhama, the lowest of men, and duskrti, one who always
commits sinful activities. Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-class or fourth-class man, for
one's position can be understood simply by this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of Krsna?
Why are devotees of the demigods greater in number than the Vaisnavas? The answer is given herein. Vaisnavas
are not interested in such fourth-class pleasures as wine and women, nor does Krsna allow them such facilities.
