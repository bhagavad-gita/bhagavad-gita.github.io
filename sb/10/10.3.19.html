<h2>Text</h2>
bhumau nidhaya tam gopi
vismita bhara-pidita
maha-purusam adadhyau
jagatam asa karmasu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhumau--on the ground; nidhaya--placing; tam--the child; gopi--mother Yasoda; vismita--being astonished;
bhara-pidita--being aggrieved by the weight of the child; maha-purusam--Lord Visnu, Narayana; adadhyau--took
shelter of; jagatam--as if the weight of the whole world; asa--engaged herself; karmasu--in other household affairs.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the
child was being attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished mother Yasoda put the child down on the
ground and began to think of Narayana. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brahmanas to counteract this
heaviness, and then she engaged in her other household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the lotus
feet of Narayana, for she could not understand that Krsna was the original source of everything.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mother Yasoda did not understand that Krsna is the heaviest of all heavy things and that Krsna rests within
everything (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani). As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), maya tatam idam sarvam jagad
avyakta-murtina: Krsna is everywhere in His impersonal form, and everything rests upon Him. Nonetheless, na
caham tesv avasthitah: Krsna is not everywhere. Mother Yasoda was unable to understand this philosophy because
she was dealing with Krsna as His real mother by the arrangement of yogamaya. Not understanding the importance
of Krsna, she could only seek shelter of Narayana for Krsna's safety and call the brahmanas to counteract the
situation.
