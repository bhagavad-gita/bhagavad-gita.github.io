tasmai tubhyam bhagavate
vasudevaya vedhase
atma-dyota-gunais channamahimne
brahmane namah
SYNONYMS
tasmai--(because You are not to be understood from the material platform, we simply offer obeisances) unto Him;
tubhyam--unto You; bhagavate--unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vasudevaya--unto Vasudeva, the origin
of Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha; vedhase--unto the origin of creation; atma-dyota-gunaih channamahimne--
unto You whose glories are covered by Your personal energy; brahmane--unto the Supreme Brahman;
namah--our respectful obeisances.
TRANSLATION
O Lord, whose glories are covered by Your own energy, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You are
Sankarsana, the origin of creation, and You are Vasudeva, the origin of the caturvyuha. Because You are everything
and are therefore the Supreme Brahman, we simply offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
PURPORT
Instead of trying to understand Krsna in detail, it is better to offer our respectful obeisances unto Him, for He is
the origin of everything and He is everything. Because we are covered by the material modes of nature, He is very
difficult for us to understand unless He reveals Himself to us. Therefore it is better for us to acknowledge that He is
everything and offer obeisances unto His lotus feet.
TEXTS 34-35

tais tair atulyatisayair
viryair dehisv asangataih
sa bhavan sarva-lokasya
bhavaya vibhavaya ca
avatirno 'msa-bhagena
sampratam patir asisam
SYNONYMS
yasya--of whom; avatarah--the different incarnations, like Matsya, Kurma and Varaha; jnayante--are speculated;
sariresu--in different bodies, differently visible; asaririnah--they are not ordinary material bodies, but are all
transcendental; taih taih--by such bodily activities; atulya--incomparable; ati-sayaih--unlimited; viryaih--by
strength and power; dehisu--by those who actually have material bodies; asangataih--which activities, enacted in
different incarnations, are impossible to be performed; sah--the same Supreme; bhavan--Your Lordship; sarvalokasya--
of everyone; bhavaya--for the elevation; vibhavaya--for the liberation; ca--and; avatirnah--have now
appeared; amsa-bhagena--in full potency, with different parts and parcels; sampratam--at the present moment;
patih asisam--You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all auspiciousness.
TRANSLATION
Appearing in bodies like those of an ordinary fish, tortoise and hog, You exhibit activities impossible for such
creatures to perform--extraordinary, incomparable, transcendental activities of unlimited power and strength.
These bodies of Yours, therefore, are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your Supreme
Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the
benefit of all living entities within this material world.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.7-8):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
Krsna appears as an incarnation when real spiritual life declines and when rogues and thieves increase to disturb
the situation of the world. Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot understand the
Lord's activities, and therefore such persons describe these activities as kalpana--mythology or imagination--
because they are rascals and the lowest of men (na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah). Such men
cannot understand that the events described by Vyasadeva in the puranas and other sastras are not fictitious or
imaginary, but factual.
Krsna, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although
the two trees were so large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Krsna, as a child, exhibited
such extraordinary strength that they fell down with a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Putana,
Sakatasura and Trnavartasura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the entire universe within His mouth,
Krsna proved that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (mudhas), because of sinful
activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is
different from that of a nondevotee.
