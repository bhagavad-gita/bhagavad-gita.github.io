<h2>Text</h2>
mahad-vicalanam nrnam
grhinam dina-cetasam
nihsreyasaya bhagavan
kalpate nanyatha kvacit
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mahat-vicalanam--the movement of great personalities; nrnam--in the houses of ordinary persons; grhinam--
especially householders; dina-cetasam--who are very simple-minded, being engaged in family maintenance and
nothing more; nihsreyasaya--a great personality has no reason to go to the grhastha but to benefit him; bhagavan--
O most powerful devotee; kalpate--is to be taken that way; na anyatha--not for any other purpose; kvacit--at any
time.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my lord, O great devotee, persons like you move from one place to another not for their own interests but for
the sake of poor-hearted grhasthas [householders]. Otherwise they have no interest in going from one place to
another.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As factually stated by Nanda Maharaja, Gargamuni, being a devotee, had no needs. Similarly, when Krsna comes
He has no needs, for He is purna, atmarama. Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to protect the
devotees and vanquish miscreants (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam). This is the mission of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and devotees also have the same mission. One who executes this mission of paraupakara,
performing welfare activities for people in general, is recognized by Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, as being very, very dear to Him (na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah). Similarly, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has advised this para-upakara, and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India:
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
"One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India [Bharata-varsa] should make his life
successful and work for the benefit of all other people." (Cc. Adi 9.41) On the whole, the duty of a pure Vaisnava
devotee is to act for the welfare of others.
Nanda Maharaja could understand that Gargamuni had come for this purpose and that his own duty now was to
act according to Gargamuni's advice. Thus he said, "Please tell me what is my duty." This should be the attitude of
everyone, especially the householder. The varnasrama society is organized into eight divisions: brahmana, ksatriya,
vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Nanda Maharaja represented himself as grhinam,
a householder. A brahmacari factually has no needs, but grhi, householders, are engaged in sense gratification. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.44), bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam tayapahrta-cetasam. Everyone has come to this material
world for sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense gratification and who
therefore accept the grhastha-asrama is very precarious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense
gratification, grhasthas are required to be trained as mahat, great mahatmas. Therefore Nanda Maharaja specifically
used the word mahad-vicalanam. Gargamuni had no interest to serve by going to Nanda Maharaja, but Nanda
Maharaja, as a grhastha, was always perfectly ready to receive instructions from a mahatma to gain the real benefit
in life. Thus he was ready to execute Gargamuni's order.
