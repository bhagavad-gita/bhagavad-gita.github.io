<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
drono vasunam pravaro
dharaya bharyaya saha
karisyamana adesan
brahmanas tam uvaca ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; dronah--by the name Drona; vasunam--of the eight Vasus (a type of
demigod); pravarah--who was the best; dharaya--with Dhara; bharyaya--His wife; saha--with; karisyamanah--just to
execute; adesan--the orders; brahmanah--of Lord Brahma; tam--unto him; uvaca--said; ha--in the past.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: To follow the orders of Lord Brahma, Drona, the best of the Vasus, along with his wife,
Dhara, spoke to Lord Brahma in this way.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.37):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuto
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
When Krsna descends anywhere, He is accompanied by His own associates. These associates are not ordinary
living beings. Krsna's pastimes are eternal, and when He descends, He comes with His associates. Therefore Nanda
and mother Yasoda are the eternal father and mother of Krsna. This means that whenever Krsna descends, Nanda
and Yasoda, as well as Vasudeva and Devaki, also descend as the Lord's father and mother. Their personalities are
expansions of Krsna's personal body; they are not ordinary living beings. Maharaja Pariksit knew this, but he was
curious to know from Sukadeva Gosvami whether it is possible for an ordinary human being to come to this stage
by sadhana-siddhi. There are two kinds of perfection--nitya-siddhi and sadhana-siddhi. A nitya-siddha is one who
is eternally Krsna's associate, an expansion of Krsna's personal body, whereas a sadhana-siddha is an ordinary
human being who, by executing pious activities and following regulative principles of devotional service, also
comes to that stage. Thus the purpose of Maharaja Pariksit's inquiry was to determine whether an ordinary human
being can attain the position of mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja. Sukadeva Gosvami answered this question as
follows.
