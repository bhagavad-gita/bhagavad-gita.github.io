<h2>Text</h2>
devarsir me priyatamo
yad imau dhanadatmajau
tat tatha sadhayisyami
yad gitam tan mahatmana
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devarsih--the great saint Devarsi Narada; me--My; priya-tamah--most beloved devotee; yat--although; imau--these
two persons (Nalakuvara and Manigriva); dhanada-atmajau--born of a rich father and being nondevotees; tat--the
words of Devarsi; tatha--just so; sadhayisyami--I shall execute (because he wanted Me to come face to face with the
yamala-arjuna, I shall do so); yat gitam--as already stated; tat--that; mahatmana--by Narada Muni.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"Although these two young men are the sons of the very rich Kuvera and I have nothing to do with them, Devarsi
Narada is My very dear and affectionate devotee, and therefore because he wanted Me to come face to face with
them, I must do so for their deliverance."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nalakuvara and Manigriva actually had nothing to do with devotional service or seeing the Supreme Personality
of Godhead face to face, for this is not an ordinary opportunity. It is not that because one is very rich or learned or
was born in an aristocratic family one will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is
impossible. But in this case, because Narada Muni desired that Nalakuvara and Manigriva see Vasudeva face to face,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to fulfill the words of His very dear devotee Narada Muni. If one seeks
the favor of a devotee instead of directly asking favors from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is very easily
successful. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore recommended: vaisnava thakura tomara kukkura bhuliya
janaha more, krsna se tomara krsna dite para. One should desire to become like a dog in strictly following a
devotee. Krsna is in the hand of a devotee. Adurlabham atma-bhaktau. Thus without the favor of a devotee, one
cannot directly approach Krsna, what to speak of engaging in His service. Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings,
chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: unless one becomes a servant of a pure devotee, one cannot be
delivered from the material condition of life. In our Gaudiya Vaisnava society, following in the footsteps of Rupa
Gosvami, our first business is to seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master (adau gurv-asrayah).
