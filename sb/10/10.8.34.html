TRANSLATION
Thereafter, everyone being pleased, the demigods began to shower flowers from Nandana-kanana, the celestial
dancing girls began to dance, and the Gandharvas, who are famous for singing, offered songs of prayer. The
drummers began to beat their kettledrums, and the brahmanas offered Vedic hymns. In this way, both in the
heavens and on earth, everyone began to perform his own duties, glorifying the Lord.
PURPORT
Everyone has some particular duty. The sastra has concluded (nirupitah) that everyone should glorify the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by his own qualifications. If you are a singer, always glorify the Supreme Lord by
singing very nicely. If you are a musician, glorify the Supreme Lord by playing musical instruments. Svanusthitasya
dharmasya samsiddhir hari-tosanam (Bhag. 1.2.13). The perfection of life is to satisfy the Personality of Godhead.
Therefore, beginning from this earth up to the celestial kingdom, everyone engaged in glorifying the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The decision of all great saintly persons is that whatever qualifications one has acquired
should be utilized to glorify the Supreme Lord.
idam hi pumsas tapasah srutasya va
svistasya suktasya ca buddhi-dattayoh
avicyuto 'rthah kavibhir nirupito
yad uttamasloka-gunanuvarnanam
"Learned sages have definitely concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, austerity,
Vedic study, sacrifice, the chanting of hymns, and charity is found in the transcendental descriptions of the
qualities of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry." (Bhag. 1.5.22) This is the perfection of life. One should be
trained how to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one's respective qualities. Education, austerity,
penance or, in the modern world, business, industry, education and so on--all should be engaged in glorifying the
Lord. Then everyone in the world will be happy.
Krsna comes, therefore, to exhibit His transcendental activities so that people may have the chance to glorify Him
in every respect. To understand how to glorify the Lord is actual research work. It is not that everything should be
understood without God. That is condemned.
bhagavad-bhakti-hinasya
jatih sastram japas tapah
apranasyaiva dehasya
mandanam loka-ranjanam
(Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 3.11)
Without bhagavad-bhakti, without glorification of the Supreme Lord, whatever we have is simply a decoration of
the dead body.
