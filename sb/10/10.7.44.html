<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: O Saunaka, greatest of saints and devotees, when Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva
Gosvami in this way, Sukadeva Gosvami, immediately remembering subject matters about Krsna within the core of
his heart, externally lost contact with the actions of his senses. Thereafter, with great difficulty, he revived his
external sensory perception and began to speak to Maharaja Pariksit about krsna-katha.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled,
"The Killing of the Demon Aghasura."
Chapter Thirteen
The Stealing of the Boys and Calves by Brahma
This chapter describes Lord Brahma's attempt to take away the calves and cowherd boys, and it also describes the
bewilderment of Lord Brahma and finally the clearance of his illusion.
Although the incident concerning Aghasura had been performed one year before, when the cowherd boys were
five years old, when they were six years old they said, "It happened today." What happened was this. After killing
Aghasura, Krsna, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being
allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore Krsna's associates became a little agitated and
wanted to bring back the calves. Krsna, however, encouraged the boys by saying, "You take your tiffin without
being agitated. I shall go find the calves." And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of Krsna,
Lord Brahma took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.
When Krsna was unable to find the calves and boys, He could understand that this was a trick performed by
Brahma. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord Brahma, as well
as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were
before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the
cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their
calves. After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of Krsna. Thus
He inquired from Krsna and was informed of what had happened.
When one full year had passed, Brahma returned and saw that Krsna was still engaged as usual with His friends
and the calves and cows. Then Krsna exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of Narayana.
Brahma could then understand Krsna's potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of Krsna, his worshipable
Lord. Krsna, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahma and released him from illusion. Thus Brahma
began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
