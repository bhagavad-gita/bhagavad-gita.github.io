<h2>Text</h2>
vayam dhanyatama loke
guro 'pi ksatra-bandhavah
vayam pibamo muhus tvattah
punyam krsna-kathamrtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vayam--we are; dhanya-tamah--most glorified; loke--in this world; guro--O my lord, my spiritual master; api--
although; ksatra-bandhavah--the lowest of the ksatriyas (because we did not act like ksatriyas); vayam--we are;
pibamah--drinking; muhuh--always; tvattah--from you; punyam--pious; krsna-katha-amrtam--the nectar of krsnakatha.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my lord, my spiritual master, although we are the lowest of ksatriyas, we are glorified and benefited because we
have the opportunity of always hearing from you the nectar of the pious activities of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to
hear such activities unless one is very, very fortunate. Pariksit Maharaja placed himself as ksatra-bandhavah, which
means "the lowest of the ksatriyas." The qualities of the ksatriya are described in Bhagavad-gita, and although the
general quality of the ksatriya is isvara-bhava, the tendency to rule, a ksatriya is not supposed to rule over a
brahmana. Thus Maharaja Pariksit regretted that he had wanted to rule over the brahmanas and had therefore been
cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the ksatriyas. Danam isvara-bhavas ca ksatram karma svabhavajam (Bg.
18.43). There was no doubt that Maharaja Pariksit had the good qualities of a ksatriya, but as a devotee he
presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the ksatriyas, remembering his act of
wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a brahmana. A student and disciple has the right to ask the guru about
any confidential service, and it is the duty of the guru to explain these confidential matters to his disciple.
