sri-raja uvaca--Maharaja Pariksit further inquired (from Sukadeva Gosvami); nandah--Maharaja Nanda; kim--
what; akarot--performed; brahman--O learned brahmana; sreyah--auspicious activities, like performing penances
and austerities; evam--as exhibited by him; maha-udayam--from which they achieved the greatest perfection;
yasoda--mother Yasoda; ca--also; maha-bhaga--most fortunate; papau--drank; yasyah--of whom; stanam--the breast
milk; harih--the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having heard of the great fortune of mother Yasoda, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O
learned brahmana, mother Yasoda's breast milk was sucked by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What past
auspicious activities did she and Nanda Maharaja perform to achieve such perfection in ecstatic love?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.16), catur-vidha bhajante mam janah sukrtino 'rjuna. Without sukrti, or pious
activities, no one can come to the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is approached by four
kinds of pious men (arto jijnasur artharthi jnani ca), but here we see that Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda surpassed all
of them. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja naturally inquired, "What kind of pious activities did they perform in their
past lives by which they achieved such a stage of perfection?" Of course, Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda are accepted
as the father and mother of Krsna, yet mother Yasoda was more fortunate than Nanda Maharaja, Krsna's father,
because Nanda Maharaja was sometimes separated from Krsna whereas Yasoda, Krsna's mother, was not separated
from Krsna at any moment. From Krsna's babyhood to His childhood and from His childhood to His youth, mother
Yasoda was always in association with Krsna. Even when Krsna was grown up, He would go to Vrndavana and sit
on the lap of mother Yasoda. Therefore there is no comparison to the fortune of mother Yasoda, and Pariksit
Maharaja naturally inquired, yasoda ca maha-bhaga.
