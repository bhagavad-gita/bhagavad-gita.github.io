<h2>Text</h2>
evam vrajaukasam pritim
yacchantau bala-cestitaih
kala-vakyaih sva-kalena
vatsa-palau babhuvatuh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this way; vraja-okasam--to all the inhabitants of Vraja; pritim--pleasure; yacchantau--giving; balacestitaih--
by the activities and pastimes of childhood; kala-vakyaih--and by very sweet broken language; svakalena--
in due course of time; vatsa-palau--to take care of the calves; babhuvatuh--were grown up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way, Krsna and Balarama, acting like small boys and talking in half-broken language, gave transcendental
pleasure to all the inhabitants of Vraja. In due course of time, They became old enough to take care of the calves.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As soon as Krsna and Balarama were a little grown up, They were meant for taking care of the calves. Although
born of a very well-to-do family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of education. Those
who were not born in brahmana families were not meant for academic education. The brahmanas were trained in a
literary, academic education, the ksatriyas were trained to take care of the state, and the vaisyas learned how to
cultivate the land and take care of the cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be
falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed. Krsna and Balarama taught us by Their
personal behavior. Krsna took care of the cows and played His flute, and Balarama took care of agricultural
activities with a plow in His hand.
