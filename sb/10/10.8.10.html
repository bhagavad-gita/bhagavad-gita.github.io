<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Nanda Maharaja said: My dear great sage, if you think that your performing this process of purification will make
Kamsa suspicious, then secretly chant the Vedic hymns and perform the purifying process of second birth here in
the cow shed of my house, without the knowledge of anyone else, even my relatives, for this process of purification
is essential.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja did not like the idea of avoiding the purificatory process. Despite the many obstacles, he wanted
to take advantage of Gargamuni's presence and do what was needed. The purificatory process is essential
specifically for brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Therefore, since Nanda Maharaja presented himself as a vaisya,
this process of purification was essential. Formerly, such institutional activities were compulsory. Catur-varnyam
maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg. 4.13). Without these activities of purification, the society would be
considered a society of animals. To take advantage of Gargamuni's presence, Nanda Maharaja wanted to perform
the nama-karana ceremonies, even secretly, without any gorgeous arrangements. Therefore, the opportunity for
purification should be regarded as the essential duty of human society. In Kali-yuga, however, people have
forgotten the essence. Mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (Bhag. 1.1.10). In this age, people are
all bad and unfortunate, and they do not accept Vedic instructions to make their life successful. Nanda Maharaja,
however, did not want to neglect anything. To keep intact a happy society advanced in spiritual knowledge, he
took full advantage of Gargamuni's presence to do what was necessary. How degraded society has become within
five thousand years. Mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagyah. The human life is obtained after many, many
millions of births, and it is intended for purification. Previously, a father was eager to give all kinds of help to
elevate his children, but at present, because of being misguided, people are prepared even to kill to avoid the
responsibility of raising children.
