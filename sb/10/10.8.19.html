<h2>Text</h2>
tasman nandatmajo 'yam te
narayana-samo gunaih
sriya kirtyanubhavena
gopayasva samahitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; nanda--O Nanda Maharaja; atmajah--your son; ayam--this; te--of you; narayana-samah--is as
good as Narayana (Narayana Himself showing transcendental qualities); gunaih--by qualities; sriya--by opulence;
kirtya--especially by His name and fame; anubhavena--and by His influence; gopayasva--just raise this child;
samahitah--with great attention and precaution.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In conclusion, therefore, O Nanda Maharaja, this child of yours is as good as Narayana. In His transcendental
qualities, opulence, name, fame and influence, He is exactly like Narayana. You should all raise this child very
carefully and cautiously.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, the word narayana-samah is significant. Narayana has no equal. He is asamaurdhva: no one is equal
to Him, and no one is greater than He is. As stated in sastra:
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
One who equates Narayana even with great exalted demigods like Lord Siva or Lord Brahma is a pasandi, an
agnostic. No one can equal Narayana. Nonetheless, Gargamuni used the word sama, meaning "equal," because he
wanted to treat Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who had become Nanda Maharaja's son. Gargamuni
wanted to impress upon the mind of Nanda Maharaja, "Your worshipable Deity, Narayana, is so pleased with you
that He has sent you a son almost equal to Him in qualifications. Therefore you may designate your son with a
similar name, such as Mukunda or Madhusudana. But you must always remember that whenever you want to do
something very good, there will be many hindrances. Therefore you should raise and protect this child with great
care. If you can protect this child very cautiously, as Narayana always protects you, the child will be as good as
Narayana." Gargamuni also indicated that although the child was exaltedly qualified like Narayana, He would
enjoy more than Narayana as rasa-vihari, the central enjoyer of the rasa dance. As stated in the Brahma-samhita,
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: He would be served by many gopis, who would all be as good as the
goddess of fortune.
