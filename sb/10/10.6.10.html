<h2>Text</h2>
krinihi bhoh phalaniti

yayau sarva-phala-pradah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
krinihi--please come and purchase; bhoh--O neighborhood residents; phalani--ripe fruits; iti--thus; srutva--
hearing; satvaram--very soon; acyutah--Krsna; phala-arthi--as if He wanted some fruits; dhanyam adaya--capturing

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once a woman selling fruit was calling, "O inhabitants of Vrajabhumi, if you want to purchase some fruits, come
here!" Upon hearing this, Krsna immediately took some grains and went to barter as if He needed some fruits.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Aborigines generally go to the villagers to sell fruits. How much the aborigines were attached to Krsna is here
described. Krsna, to show His favor to the aborigines, would immediately go purchase fruits, bartering with paddy
in His hand as He had seen others do.
