<h2>Translation</h2>
"Our dear friend Yasoda, your son sometimes comes to our houses before the milking of the cows and releases
the calves, and when the master of the house becomes angry, your son merely smiles. Sometimes He devises some
process by which He steals palatable curd, butter and milk, which He then eats and drinks. When the monkeys
assemble, He divides it with them, and when the monkeys have their bellies so full that they won't take more, He
breaks the pots. Sometimes, if He gets no opportunity to steal butter or milk from a house, He will be angry at the
householders, and for His revenge He will agitate the small children by pinching them. Then, when the children
begin crying, Krsna will go away.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The narration of Krsna's naughty childhood activities would be presented to mother Yasoda in the form of
complaints. Sometimes Krsna would enter the house of a neighbor, and if He found no one there, He would release
the calves before the time for the cows to be milked. The calves are actually supposed to be released when their
mothers are milked, but Krsna would release them before that time, and naturally the calves would drink all the
milk from their mothers. When the cowherd men saw this, they would chase Krsna and try to catch Him, saying,
"Here is Krsna doing mischief," but He would flee and enter another house, where He would again devise some
means to steal butter and curd. Then the cowherd men would again try to capture Him, saying, "Here is the butter
thief. Better capture Him!" And they would be angry. But Krsna would simply smile, and they would forget
everything. Sometimes, in their presence, He would begin eating the curd and butter. There was no need for Krsna
to eat butter, since His belly was always full, but He would try to eat it, or else He would break the pots and
distribute the contents to the monkeys. In this way, Krsna was always engaged in mischief-making. If in any house
He could not find any butter or curd to steal, He would go into a room and agitate the small children sleeping there
by pinching them, and when they cried He would go away.
