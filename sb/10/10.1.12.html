<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--thereafter; enam--to the child; astaut--offered prayers; avadharya--understanding surely that the child was
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; purusam--the Supreme Person; param--transcendental; nata-angah--falling
down; krta-dhih--with concentrated attention; krta-anjalih--with folded hands; sva-rocisa--by the brilliance of His
personal beauty; bharata--O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of Maharaja Bharata; sutika-grham--the place where the
Lord was born; virocayantam--illuminating all around; gata-bhih--all his fear disappeared; prabhava-vit--he could
now understand the influence (of the Supreme Personality of Godhead).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of King Bharata, Vasudeva could understand that this child was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Having concluded this without a doubt, he became fearless. Bowing down with
folded hands and concentrating his attention, he began to offer prayers to the child, who illuminated His birthplace
by His natural influence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Struck with such great wonder, Vasudeva now concentrated his attention on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Understanding the influence of the Supreme Lord, he was surely fearless, since he understood that the
Lord had appeared to give him protection (gata-bhih prabhava-vit). Understanding that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was present, he appropriately offered prayers as follows.
