<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, accompanied by plenary expansions, the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is allauspicious
for the entire universe, was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaki. Devaki,
having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord Krsna, the original consciousness for
everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the
rising moon.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As indicated here by the word manastah, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was transferred from the core of
Vasudeva's mind or heart to the core of the heart of Devaki. We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred
to Devaki not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by diksa, initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is
mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one's own
heart.
The word acyutamsam is used because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Sad-aisvarya-purna, full in the
opulences of wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. The Supreme Godhead is never
separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.39), ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena
tisthan: the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as Rama, Nrsimha and Varaha. Therefore
the word acyutamsam is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary
expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as yogis do. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena
manasa pasyanti yam yoginah (Bhag. 12.13.1). Yogis meditate upon the Supreme person within the mind. For a
devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide
spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devaki, for His presence within the core of her
heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that Krsna was begotten by Vasudeva within the
womb of Devaki and that she carried the child within her womb.
When Vasudeva was sustaining the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, he appeared
just like the glowing sun, whose shining rays are always unbearable and scorching to the common man. The form
of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of Krsna. The
appearance of the form of Krsna anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called dhama. Dhama refers not
only to Krsna's form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest
simultaneously.
Thus the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full potencies was transferred from the mind
of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaki, exactly as the setting sun's rays are transferred to the full moon rising in the
east.
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered the body of Devaki from the body of Vasudeva. He was
beyond the conditions of the ordinary living entity. When Krsna is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary
expansions, such as Narayana, and incarnations like Lord Nrsimha and Varaha, are with Him, and they are not
subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devaki became the residence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devaki became the residence of
the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Kamsa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like
misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire
cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is
not very much appreciated. So Devaki was kept within the prison walls of Kamsa's palace, and no one could see her
transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Commenting upon this verse, Sri Viraraghava Acarya writes, vasudeva-devaki jatharayor hrdayayor bhagavatah
sambandhah. The Supreme Lord's entrance into the womb of Devaki from the heart of Vasudeva was a heart-toheart
relationship.
