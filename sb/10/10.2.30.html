<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvayi--in You; ambuja-aksa--O lotus-eyed Lord; akhila-sattva-dhamni--who are the original cause of all existence,
from whom everything emanates and in whom all potencies reside; samadhina--by constant meditation and
complete absorption (in thoughts of You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead); avesita--fully absorbed, fully
engaged; cetasa--but by such a mentality; eke--the one process of always thinking of Your lotus feet; tvat-padapotena--

hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim--the great ocean of nescience.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence,
and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps
of mahajanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as
easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The true mission in life is to cross the ocean of nescience, of repeated birth and death. Those in the darkness of
ignorance, however, do not know this mission. Instead, being carried away by the waves of material nature
(prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah), they are undergoing the tribulations of mrtyu-samsara-vartmani,
repeated birth and death. But persons who have achieved knowledge by the association of devotees follow the
mahajanas (mahat-krtena). Such a person always concentrates his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord and
executes one or more of the nine varieties of devotional service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam padasevanam).
Simply by this process, one can cross the insurmountable ocean of nescience.
Devotional service is powerful in any form. Sri-visnoh sravane pariksid abhavad vaiyasakih kirtane (Bhaktirasamrta-
sindhu 1.2.265). According to this verse, Maharaja Pariksit became liberated by fully concentrating his
mind on hearing the Lord's holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, Sukadeva Gosvami simply glorified the
Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of Krsna that constitute the entire Srimad-Bhagavatam, he too was
liberated. One may also be liberated simply by sakhya, friendly behavior with the Lord. Such is the power of
devotional service, as we learn from the examples set by the Lord's many pure devotees.
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
(Bhag. 6.3.20)
We have to follow in the footsteps of such devotees, for by this one easy process one can cross the great ocean of
nescience just as one might cross a small hole created by the hoof of a calf.
Here the Lord is described as ambujaksa, or lotus-eyed. By seeing the eyes of the Lord, which are compared to
lotus flowers, one becomes so satisfied that one does not want to turn his eyes to anything else. Simply by seeing
the transcendental form of the Lord, a devotee is at once fully absorbed in the Lord in his heart. This absorption is
called samadhi. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah (Bhag. 12.13.1). A yogi is fully absorbed
in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he has no other business than to think of the Lord always
within the heart. It is also said:
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation
and is famous as Murari, the enemy of the demon Mura, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained
in a calf's hoofprint. His goal is param padam, or Vaikuntha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the
place where there is danger at every step." (Bhag. 10.14.58) This process is recommended here by authorities like
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva (svayambhur naradah sambhuh), and therefore we must take to this process in order to
transcend nescience. This is very easy, but we must follow in the footsteps of great personalities, and then success
will be possible.
In regard to the word mahat-krtena, it is also significant that the process shown by great devotees is not only for
them but also for others. If things are made easy, this affords facility for the person who has made them easy and
also for others who follow the same principles. The process recommended in this verse for crossing the ocean of
nescience is easy not only for the devotee but also for common persons who follow the devotee (mahajano yena
gatah sa panthah).
