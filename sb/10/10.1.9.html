O all-auspicious Yogamaya, I shall then appear with My full six opulences as the son of Devaki, and you will
appear as the daughter of mother Yasoda, the queen of Maharaja Nanda.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word amsa-bhagena is important in this verse. In Bhagavad-gita (10.42) the Lord says:
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and
support this entire universe." Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord's potency. In regard to Lord
Krsna's appearance in the womb of Devaki, Brahma played a part also because on the bank of the milk ocean he
requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of
Godhead. Similarly, Yogamaya, who appeared as the daughter of mother Yasoda, also played a part. Thus jivatattva,
visnu-tattva and sakti-tattva are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when Krsna
appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yogamaya was requested to
attract Sankarsana, Baladeva, from the womb of Devaki to the womb of Rohini, and this was a very heavy task for
her. Yogamaya naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Sankarsana. Therefore Krsna addressed
her as subhe, auspicious, and said, "Be blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it." By the grace of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things
being His parts and parcels (amsa-bhagena) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balarama was only
fifteen days older than Krsna. By the blessings of Krsna, Yogamaya became the daughter of mother Yasoda, but by
the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. Krsna, however, although
not actually born from the womb of mother Yasoda, enjoyed the parental love of mother Yasoda and Nanda. By the
blessings of Krsna, Yogamaya was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Yasoda, who also
became famous by the blessings of Krsna. Yasoda means "one who gives fame."
