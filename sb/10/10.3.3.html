<h2>Text</h2>
athanyad api krsnasya
tokacaritam adbhutam
manusam lokam asadya
taj-jatim anurundhatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--also; anyat api--other pastimes also; krsnasya--of child Krsna; toka-acaritam adbhutam--they are also
wonderful childhood pastimes; manusam--as if playing as a human child; lokam asadya--appearing on this planet
earth in human society; tat-jatim--exactly like a human child; anurundhatah--who was imitating.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Please describe other pastimes of Krsna, the Supreme Personality, who appeared on this planet earth, imitating a
human child and performing wonderful activities like killing Putana.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva Gosvami to narrate other childhood pastimes exhibited by Krsna while
playing as a human child. The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates at different times in different planets
and universes, and according to the nature of those places, He exhibits His unlimited potency. That a child sitting
on the lap of his mother was able to kill the gigantic Putana is extremely wonderful for the inhabitants of this
planet, but on other planets the inhabitants are more advanced, and therefore the pastimes the Lord performs there
are still more wonderful. Krsna's appearance on this planet like a human being makes us more fortunate than the
demigods in the higher planets, and therefore Maharaja Pariksit was very much interested in hearing about Him.
