atha--thereafter; kale--in due course of time; upavrtte--when it was ripe; devaki--Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva,
Krsna's father; sarva-devata--Devaki, to whom all the demigods and God Himself appeared; putran--sons;

<h2>Translation</h2>
Each year thereafter, in due course of time, Devaki, the mother of God and all the demigods, gave birth to a child.
Thus she bore eight sons, one after another, and a daughter named Subhadra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The spiritual master is sometimes glorified as sarva-devamayo guruh (Bhag. 11.7.27). By the grace of the guru,
the spiritual master, one can understand the different kinds of devas. The word deva refers to God, the Supreme
personality of Godhead, who is the original source of all the demigods, who are also called devas. In Bhagavad-gita
(10.2) the Lord says, aham adir hi devanam: "I am the source of all the devas." The Supreme Lord, Visnu, the
Original person, expands in different forms. Tad aiksata bahu syam (Chandogya Upanisad 6.2.3). He alone has
expanded into many. Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam (Brahma-samhita 5.33). There are different grades
of forms, known as svamsa and vibhinnamsa. The svamsa expansions, or visnu-tattva, are the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, whereas the vibhinnamsa are jiva-tattva, who are part and parcel of the Lord (mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah). If we accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him, all the parts
and expansions of the Lord are automatically worshiped. Sarvarhanam acyutejya (Bhag. 4.31.14). Krsna is known
as Acyuta (senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta). By worshiping Acyuta, Krsna, one automatically
worships all the demigods. There is no need of separately worshiping either the visnu-tattva or jiva-tattva. If one
concentrates upon Krsna, one worships everyone. Therefore, because mother Devaki gave birth to Krsna, she is
described here as sarva-devata.
