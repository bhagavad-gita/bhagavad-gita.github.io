<h2>Text</h2>
evam dharstyany usati kurute mehanadini vastau
steyopayair viracita-krtih supratiko yathaste
ittham stribhih sa-bhaya-nayana-sri-mukhalokinibhir
vyakhyatartha prahasita-mukhi na hy upalabdhum aicchat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this way; dharstyani--naughty activities; usati--in a neat and clean place; kurute--sometimes does;
mehana-adini--passing stool and urine; vastau--in our houses; steya-upayaih--and by inventing different devices to
steal butter and milk; viracita-krtih--is very expert; su-pratikah--is now sitting down here like a very good, wellbehaved
child; yatha aste--while staying here; ittham--all these topics of conversation; stribhih--by the gopis; sabhaya-
nayana--just now sitting there with fearful eyes; sri-mukha--such a beautiful face; alokinibhih--by the gopis,
who were enjoying the pleasure of seeing; vyakhyata-artha--and while complaining against Him before mother
Yasoda; prahasita-mukhi--they were smiling and enjoying; na--not; hi--indeed; upalabdhum--to chastise and
threaten (rather, she enjoyed how Krsna was sitting there as a very good boy); aicchat--she desired.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"When Krsna is caught in His naughty activities, the master of the house will say to Him, 'Oh, You are a thief,'
and artificially express anger at Krsna. Krsna will then reply, 'I am not a thief. You are a thief.' Sometimes, being
angry, Krsna passes urine and stool in a neat, clean place in our houses. But now, our dear friend Yasoda, this
expert thief is sitting before you like a very good boy." Sometimes all the gopis would look at Krsna sitting there,
His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and when they saw Krsna's beautiful face, instead of
chastising Him they would simply look upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yasoda would mildly
smile at all this fun, and she would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental child.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna's business in the neighborhood was not only to steal but sometimes to pass stool and urine in a neat, clean
house. When caught by the master of the house, Krsna would chastise him, saying, "You are a thief." Aside from
being a thief in His childhood affairs, Krsna acted as an expert thief when He was young by attracting young girls
and enjoying them in the rasa dance. This is Krsna's business. He is also violent, as the killer of many demons.
Although mundane people like nonviolence and other such brilliant qualities, God, the Absolute Truth, being
always the same, is good in any activities, even so-called immoral activities like stealing, killing and violence. Krsna
is always pure, and He is always the Supreme Absolute Truth. Krsna may do anything supposedly abominable in
material life, yet still He is attractive. Therefore His name is Krsna, meaning "all-attractive." This is the platform on
which transcendental loving affairs and service are exchanged. Because of the features of Krsna's face, the mothers
were so attracted that they could not chastise Him. Instead of chastising Him, they smiled and enjoyed hearing of
Krsna's activities. Thus the gopis remained satisfied, and Krsna enjoyed their happiness. Therefore another name of
Krsna is Gopi-jana-vallabha because He invented such activities to please the gopis.
