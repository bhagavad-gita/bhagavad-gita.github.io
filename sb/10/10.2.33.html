bhrasyanti margat tvayi baddha-sauhrdah
tvayabhigupta vicaranti nirbhaya

fortune; tavakah--the followers of the devotional path, the devotees; kvacit--in any circumstances; bhrasyanti--fall

murdhasu--on their heads; prabho--O Lord.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Madhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with
You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus
they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devotees generally do not fall down, but if circumstantially they do, the Lord, because of their strong attachment
to Him, gives them protection in all circumstances. Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to
traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our Krsna consciousness movement has many
opponents, such as the "deprogrammers," who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that
this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was
settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in Bhagavadgita
(9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never
perishes." In history there are many instances of devotees like Citraketu, Indradyumna and Maharaja Bharata who
circumstantially fell down but were still protected. Maharaja Bharata, for example, because of his attachment to a
deer, thought of the deer at the time of death, and therefore in his next life he became a deer (yam yam vapi smaran
bhavam tyajaty ante kalevaram). Because of protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the deer
remembered his relationship with the Lord and next took birth in a good brahminical family and performed
devotional service (sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate). Similarly, Citraketu fell down and became a
demon, Vrtrasura, but he too was protected. Thus even if one falls down from the path of bhakti-yoga, one is
ultimately saved. If a devotee is strongly situated in devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has
promised to protect him (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). But even if a devotee circumstantially
falls down, he is protected by Madhava.
The word Madhava is significant. Ma, mother Laksmi, the mother of all opulences, is always with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and if a devotee is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the opulences of
the Lord are ready to help him.
yatra yogesvarah krsno
yatra partho dhanur-dharah
tatra srir vijayo bhutir
dhruva nitir matir mama
(Bg. 18.78)
Wherever there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and His devotee Arjuna, Partha, there is victory,
opulence, extraordinary power and morality. The opulences of a devotee are not a result of karma-kanda-vicara. A
devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord's opulences, of which no one can deprive him (tesam
nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee,
therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion. The adherent devotee is assured all protection
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
