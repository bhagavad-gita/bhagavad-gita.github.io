yuvam vai brahmanadistau
praja-sarge yada tatah
sanniyamyendriya-gramam
tepathe paramam tapah
SYNONYMS
yuvam--both of you (Prsni and Sutapa); vai--indeed; brahmana adistau--ordered by Lord Brahma (who is known
as Pitamaha, the father of the Prajapatis); praja-sarge--in the creation of progeny; yada--when; tatah--thereafter;
sanniyamya--keeping under full control; indriya-gramam--the senses; tepathe--underwent; paramam--very great;
tapah--austerity.
TRANSLATION
When both of you were ordered by Lord Brahma to create progeny, you first underwent severe austerities by
controlling your senses.
PURPORT
Here is an instruction about how to use one's senses to create progeny. According to Vedic principles, before
creating progeny one must fully control the senses. This control takes place through the garbhadhana-samskara. In
India there is great agitation for birth control in various mechanical ways, but birth cannot be mechanically
controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.9), janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam: birth, death, old
age and disease are certainly the primary distresses of the material world. People are trying to control birth, but
they are not able to control death; and if one cannot control death, one cannot control birth either. In other words,
artificially controlling birth is not any more feasible than artificially controlling death.
According to Vedic civilization, procreation should not be contrary to religious principles, and then the birthrate
will be controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo'smi: sex not contrary to
religious principles is a representation of the Supreme Lord. People should be educated in how to give birth to
good children through samskaras, beginning with the garbhadhana-samskara; birth should not be controlled by
artificial means, for this will lead to a civilization of animals. If one follows religious principles, he automatically
practices birth control because if one is spiritually educated he knows that the after-effects of sex are various types
of misery (bahu-duhkha-bhaja). One who is spiritually advanced does not indulge in uncontrolled sex. Therefore,
instead of being forced to refrain from sex or refrain from giving birth to many children, people should be
spiritually educated, and then birth control will automatically follow.
If one is determined to make spiritual advancement, he will not beget a child unless able to make that child a
devotee. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.18), pita na sa syat: one should not become a father unless one is
able to protect his child from mrtyu, the path of birth and death. But where is there education about this? A
responsible father never begets children like cats and dogs. Instead of being encouraged to adopt artificial means of
birth control, people should be educated in Krsna consciousness because only then will they understand their
responsibility to their children. If one can beget children who will be devotees and be taught to turn aside from the
path of birth and death (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani), there is no need of birth control. Rather, one should be
encouraged to beget children. Artificial means of birth control have no value. Whether one begets children or does
not, a population of men who are like cats and dogs will never make human society happy. It is therefore necessary
for people to be educated spiritually so that instead of begetting children like cats and dogs, they will undergo
austerities to produce devotees. This will make their lives successful.

TRANSLATION
My dear father and mother, you endured rain, wind, strong sun, scorching heat and severe cold, suffering all
sorts of inconvenience according to different seasons. By practicing pranayama to control the air within the body
through yoga, and by eating only air and dry leaves fallen from the trees, you cleansed from your minds all dirty
things. In this way, desiring a benediction from Me, you worshiped Me with peaceful minds.
PURPORT
Vasudeva and Devaki did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the
Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devaki
obtained Krsna as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for
getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get Krsna as his son, but at least one can get very
good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that if human beings do not
follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of varna-sankara population, population begotten like cats
and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing Krsna consciousness but simply encouraging
artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of varnasankara,
unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in
controlled life.
Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for tapo divyam, transcendental austerity. Everyone
should be taught to undergo austerity, tapasya. Although it may not be possible to undergo tapasya like that of
Prsni and Sutapa, the sastra has given an opportunity for a method of tapasya very easy to perform--the sankirtana
movement. One cannot expect to undergo tapasya to get Krsna as one's child, yet simply by chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra (kirtanad eva krsnasya), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the
contamination of this material world (mukta-sangah) and goes back home, back to Godhead (param vrajet). The
Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take
the real path of happiness as prescribed in the sastra--the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra--and become perfect
in every aspect of material existence.
