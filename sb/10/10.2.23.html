<h2>Text</h2>
distya bhratah pravayasa
idanim aprajasya te
prajasaya nivrttasya
praja yat samapadyata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
distya--it is by great fortune; bhratah--O my dear brother; pravayasah--of you whose age is now quite advanced;
idanim--at the present moment; aprajasya--of one who did not have a son before; te--of you; praja-asayah
nivrttasya--of one who was almost hopeless of getting a son at this age; praja--a son; yat--whatever; samapadyata--
has been gotten by chance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear brother Nanda Maharaja, at an advanced age you had no son at all and were hopeless of having one.
Therefore, that you now have a son is a sign of great fortune.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At an advanced age one generally cannot beget a male child. If by chance one does beget a child at this age, the
child is generally female. Thus Vasudeva indirectly asked Nanda Maharaja whether he had actually begotten a male
child or a female child. Vasudeva knew that Yasoda had given birth to a female child, whom he had stolen and
replaced with a male child. This was a great mystery, and Vasudeva wanted to determine whether this mystery was
already known to Nanda Maharaja. On inquiring, however, he was confident that the mystery of Krsna's birth and
His being placed in the care of Yasoda was still hidden. There was no danger, since Kamsa at least could not learn
what had already happened.
