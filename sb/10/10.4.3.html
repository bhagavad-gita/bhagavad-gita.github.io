<h2>Text</h2>
ksaumam vasah prthu-kati-tate bibhrati sutra-naddham
putra-sneha-snuta-kuca-yugam jata-kampam ca subhruh
rajjv-akarsa-srama-bhuja-calat-kankanau kundale ca
svinnam vaktram kabara-vigalan-malati nirmamantha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ksaumam--saffron and yellow mixed; vasah--mother Yasoda was wearing such a sari; prthu-kati-tate--
surrounding her large hips; bibhrati--shaking; sutra-naddham--bound with a belt; putra-sneha-snuta--because of
intense love for her child, became wet with milk; kuca-yugam--the nipples of her breasts; jata-kampam ca--as they
were very nicely moving and quivering; su-bhruh--who had very beautiful eyebrows; rajju-akarsa--by pulling on
the rope of the churning rod; srama--because of the labor; bhuja--on whose hands; calat-kankanau--the two
bangles were moving; kundale--the two earrings; ca--also; svinnam--her hair was black like a cloud, so perspiration
was dropping like rain; vaktram--throughout her face; kabara-vigalat-malati--and malati flowers were dropping
from her hair; nirmamantha--thus mother Yasoda was churning the butter.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dressed in a saffron-yellow sari, with a belt tied about her full hips, mother Yasoda pulled on the churning rope,
laboring considerably, her bangles and earrings moving and vibrating and her whole body shaking. Because of her
intense love for her child, her breasts were wet with milk. Her face, with its very beautiful eyebrows, was wet with
perspiration, and malati flowers were falling from her hair.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Anyone who desires to be Krsna conscious in motherly affection or parental affection should contemplate the
bodily features of mother Yasoda. It is not that one should desire to become like Yasoda, for this is Mayavada.
Either in parental affection or conjugal love, friendship or servitorship--in any way--we must follow in the
footsteps of the inhabitants of Vrndavana, not try to become like them. Therefore this description is provided here.
Advanced devotees must cherish this description, always thinking of mother Yasoda's features--how she was
dressed, how she was working and perspiring, how beautifully the flowers were arranged in her hair, and so on.
One should take advantage of the full description provided here by thinking of mother Yasoda in maternal affection
for Krsna.
