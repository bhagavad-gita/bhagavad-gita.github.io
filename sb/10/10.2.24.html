staying anywhere; bhunjanah--while eating; paryatan--while walking or moving; mahim--on the ground, going

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While sitting on his throne or in his sitting room, while lying on his bed, or, indeed, while situated anywhere,
and while eating, sleeping or walking, Kamsa saw only his enemy, the Supreme Lord, Hrsikesa. In other words, by
thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Kamsa became unfavorably Krsna conscious.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Rupa Gosvami has described the finest pattern of devotional service as anukulyena krsnanusilanam, or
cultivating Krsna consciousness favorably. Kamsa, of course, was also Krsna conscious, but because he regarded
Krsna as his enemy, even though he was fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness, his Krsna consciousness was not
favorable for his existence. Krsna consciousness, favorably cultivated, makes one completely happy, so much so
that a Krsna conscious person does not consider kaivalya-sukham, or merging into the existence of Krsna, to be a
great gain. Kaivalyam narakayate. For a Krsna conscious person, even merging into the existence of Krsna, or
Brahman, as impersonalists aspire to do, is uncomfortable. Kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate.
Karmis hanker to be promoted to the heavenly planets, but a Krsna conscious person considers such promotion a
will-o'-the-wisp, good for nothing. Durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate. Yogis try to control
their senses and thus become happy, but a Krsna conscious person neglects the methods of yoga. He is
unconcerned with the greatest of enemies, the senses, which are compared to snakes. For a Krsna conscious person
who is cultivating Krsna consciousness favorably, the happiness conceived by the karmis, jnanis and yogis is
treated as less than a fig. Kamsa, however, because of cultivating Krsna consciousness in a different way--that is,
inimically--was uncomfortable in all the affairs of his life; whether sitting, sleeping, walking or eating, he was
always in danger. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. A nondevotee or atheist also
cultivates God consciousness--by trying to avoid God in everything. For example, so-called scientists who want to
create life by a combination of chemicals regard the external, material elements as supreme. Such scientists do not
like the idea that life is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita (mamaivamso jivaloke
jiva-bhutah), the living entities do not arise from a combination of material elements, such as earth, water, air
and fire, but are separated portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can understand the position of
the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living
entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the
Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating Krsna
consciousness in various unfavorable ways.
Although Kamsa was always absorbed in thoughts of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was not
happy. A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. Srila Rupa Gosvami
resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. Tyaktva turnam asesamandalapati-
srenim sada tucchavat (Sad-gosvamy-astaka 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as
minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in Vrndavana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems,
whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness.
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
(Caitanya-candramrta 95)
This comfortable position of a devotee can be established by the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Yasmin
sthito na duhkhena gurunapi vicalyate (Bg. 6.22). Even when a devotee is superficially put into great difficulty, he
is never disturbed.
