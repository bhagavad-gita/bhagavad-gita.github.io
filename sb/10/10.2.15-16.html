<h2>Translation</h2>
The great-minded Maharaja Nanda gave clothing, ornaments and cows in charity to the cowherd men in order to
please Lord Visnu, and thus he improved the condition of his own son in all respects. He distributed charity to the
sutas, the magadhas, the vandis, and men of all other professions, according to their educational qualifications, and
satisfied everyone's desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although it has become fashionable to speak of daridra-narayana, the words visnor aradhanarthaya do not mean
that all the people satisfied by Nanda Maharaja in this great ceremony were Visnus. They were not daridra, nor
were they Narayana. Rather, they were devotees of Narayana, and by their educational qualifications they would
satisfy Narayana. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Visnu. Mad-bhaktapujabhyadhika
(Bhag. 11.19.21). The Lord says, "Worshiping My devotees is better than worshiping Me directly."
The varnasrama system is entirely meant for visnu-aradhana, worship of Lord Visnu. Varnasramacaravata purusena
parah puman. visnur aradhyate (Visnu Purana 3.8.9). The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Visnu, the Supreme
Lord. The uncivilized man or materialistic person, however, does not know this aim of life. Na te viduh svarthagatim
hi visnum (Bhag. 7.5.31). One's real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Visnu. Not satisfying Lord Visnu but
instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (bahir-artha-maninah) is the wrong way for
happiness. Because Visnu is the root of everything, if Visnu is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one's
children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Maharaja wanted to see his newborn child
happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Visnu, and to satisfy Lord Visnu it was necessary
to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned brahmanas, magadhas and sutas. Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately
it was Lord Visnu who was to be satisfied.
