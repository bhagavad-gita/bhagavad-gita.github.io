<h2>Text</h2>
tan viksya krsnah sakalabhaya-prado
hy ananya-nathan sva-karad avacyutan
dinams ca mrtyor jatharagni-ghasan
ghrnardito dista-krtena vismitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan--all those boys; viksya--seeing; krsnah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna; sakala-abhaya-pradah--
who is the source of fearlessness for everyone; hi--indeed; ananya-nathan--especially for the cowherd boys, who did
not know anyone except Krsna; sva-karat--from the control of His hand; avacyutan--now gone out; dinan ca--
helpless; mrtyoh jathara-agni-ghasan--who had all entered like straws into the fire of the abdomen of Aghasura,
who was very bold and hungry, like death personified (because the asura had assumed a big body, he must have
had a very strong appetite); ghrna-arditah--therefore, being compassionate due to causeless mercy; dista-krtena--by
things arranged by His internal potency; vismitah--He also, for the time being, was astonished.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Krsna saw that all the cowherd boys, who did not know anyone but Him as their Lord, had now gone out of His
hand and were helpless, having entered like straws into the fire of the abdomen of Aghasura, who was death
personified. It was intolerable for Krsna to be separated from His friends the cowherd boys. Therefore, as if seeing
that this had been arranged by His internal potency, Krsna was momentarily struck with wonder and unsure of
what to do.
