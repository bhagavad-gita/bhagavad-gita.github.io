<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear father and mother, you endured rain, wind, strong sun, scorching heat and severe cold, suffering all
sorts of inconvenience according to different seasons. By practicing pranayama to control the air within the body
through yoga, and by eating only air and dry leaves fallen from the trees, you cleansed from your minds all dirty
things. In this way, desiring a benediction from Me, you worshiped Me with peaceful minds.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vasudeva and Devaki did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the
Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devaki
obtained Krsna as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for
getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get Krsna as his son, but at least one can get very
good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that if human beings do not
follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of varna-sankara population, population begotten like cats
and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing Krsna consciousness but simply encouraging
artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of varnasankara,
unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in
controlled life.
Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for tapo divyam, transcendental austerity. Everyone
should be taught to undergo austerity, tapasya. Although it may not be possible to undergo tapasya like that of
Prsni and Sutapa, the sastra has given an opportunity for a method of tapasya very easy to perform--the sankirtana
movement. One cannot expect to undergo tapasya to get Krsna as one's child, yet simply by chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra (kirtanad eva krsnasya), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the
contamination of this material world (mukta-sangah) and goes back home, back to Godhead (param vrajet). The
Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take
the real path of happiness as prescribed in the sastra--the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra--and become perfect
in every aspect of material existence.
