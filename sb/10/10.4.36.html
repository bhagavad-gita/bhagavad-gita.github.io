<h2>Text</h2>
yady evam tarhi vyadehity
uktah sa bhagavan harih
vyadattavyahataisvaryah
krida-manuja-balakah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yadi--if; evam--it is so; tarhi--then; vyadehi--open Your mouth wide (I want to see); iti uktah--in this way ordered
by mother Yasoda; sah--He; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; harih--the Supreme Lord; vyadatta--
opened His mouth; avyahata-aisvaryah--without minimizing any potencies of absolute opulence (aisvaryasya
samagrasya); krida--pastimes; manuja-balakah--exactly like the child of a human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Mother Yasoda challenged Krsna, "If You have not eaten earth, then open Your mouth wide." When challenged
by His mother in this way, Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, to exhibit pastimes like a human child,
opened His mouth. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is full of all opulences, did not
disturb His mother's parental affection, His opulence was automatically displayed, for Krsna's opulence is never
lost at any stage, but is manifest at the proper time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Without disturbing the ecstasy of His mother's affection, Krsna opened His mouth and displayed His own natural
opulences. When a person is given varieties of food, there may be a hundred and one varieties, but if one likes
ordinary saka, spinach, he prefers to eat that. Similarly, although Krsna was full of opulences, now, by the order of
mother Yasoda, He opened wide His mouth like a human child and did not neglect the transcendental humor of
maternal affection.
