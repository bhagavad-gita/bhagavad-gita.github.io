<h2>Text</h2>
asan varnas trayo hy asya
grhnato 'nuyugam tanuh
suklo raktas tatha pita
idanim krsnatam gatah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asan--were assumed; varnah trayah--three colors; hi--indeed; asya--of your son Krsna; grhnatah--accepting;
anuyugam tanuh--transcendental bodies according to the different yugas; suklah--sometimes white; raktah--
sometimes red; tatha--as well as; pitah--sometimes yellow; idanim krsnatam gatah--at the present moment He has
assumed a blackish color.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Your son Krsna appears as an incarnation in every millennium. In the past, He assumed three different colors--
white, red and yellow--and now He has appeared in a blackish color. [In another Dvapara-yuga, He appeared (as
Lord Ramacandra) in the color of suka, a parrot. All such incarnations have now assembled in Krsna.]
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Partially explaining the position of Lord Krsna and partially covering the facts, Gargamuni indicated, "Your son is
a great personality, and He can change the color of His body in different ages." The word grhnatah indicates that
Krsna is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do
whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different
millenniums are stated, and therefore when Gargamuni said, "Your son has assumed these colors," he indirectly
said, "He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Because of Kamsa's atrocities, Gargamuni tried to avoid
disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Maharaja that Krsna, his son, was the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
It may be noted that Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his book Krama-sandarbha, has enunciated the purport of this verse.
In every millennium, Krsna appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally
appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Gargamuni, exhibited the power of Narayana. Because
in this form the Supreme personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is Sri Krsna, the all-attractive.
Factually, Krsna is the source of all avataras, and therefore all the different features of the different avataras are
present in Krsna. When Krsna incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him.
Other incarnations are partial representations of Krsna, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It
is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as sukla, rakta or pita (white, red or yellow), is the
same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine,
which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine
is observed mainly as bright light. The different avataras, such as the manvantara-avataras, lila-avataras and dasaavataras,
are all included in the krsna-avatara. When Krsna appears, all the avataras appear with Him. As described
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.3.26):
avatara hy asankhyeya
hareh sattva-nidher dvijah
yathavidasinah kulyah
sarasah syuh sahasrasah
The avataras incessantly appear, like incessantly flowing water. No one can count how many waves there are in
flowing water, and similarly there is no limitation of the avataras. And Krsna is the full representation of all
avataras because He is the source of all avataras. Krsna is amsi, whereas others are amsa, part of Krsna. All living
entities, including us, are amsas (mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah). These amsas are of different
magnitude. Human beings (who are minute amsas) and the demigods, visnu-tattva and all other living beings are
all part of the Supreme. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). Krsna is the full
representation of all living entities, and when Krsna is present, all avataras are included in Him.
The Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the incarnations for each yuga in chronological order. The
Bhagavatam says, krte suklas catur-bahuh, tretayam rakta-varno'sau, dvapare bhagavan syamah and krsna-varnam
tvisakrsnam. We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagavan has appeared in pita-varna, or a yellow color, as
Gaurasundara, although the Bhagavatam speaks of krsna-varnam. To adjust all these statements, one should
understand that although in some yugas some of the colors are prominent, in every yuga, whenever Krsna appears,
all the colors are present. Krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam: although Caitanya Mahaprabhu appears without krsna, or a
blackish color, He is understood to be Krsna Himself. Idanim krsnatam gatah. The same original Krsna who
appears in different varnas has now appeared. The word asan indicates that He is always present. Whenever the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in His full feature, He is understood to be krsna-varnam, although He
appears in different colors. Prahlada Maharaja states that Caitanya Mahaprabhu is channa; that is, although He is
Krsna, He is covered by a yellow color. Thus the Gaudiya Vaisnavas accept the conclusion that although Caitanya
Mahaprabhu appeared in pita color, He is Krsna.
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
(Bhag. 11.5.32)
