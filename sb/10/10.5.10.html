<h2>Text</h2>
deva-samjnitam apy ante
krmi-vid-bhasma-samjnitam
bhuta-dhruk tat-krte svartham
kim veda nirayo yatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
deva-samjnitam--the body now known as a very exalted person, like president, minister or even demigod; api--
even if the body is so exalted; ante--after death; krmi--turns into worms; vit--or into stool; bhasma-samjnitam--or
into ashes; bhuta-dhruk--a person who does not accept the sastric injunctions and is unnecessarily envious of other
living entities; tat-krte--by acting in that way; sva-artham--self-interest; kim--who is there; veda--who knows;
nirayah yatah--because from such sinful activities one must suffer hellish conditions.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While living one may be proud of one's body, thinking oneself a very big man, minister, president or even
demigod, but whatever one may be, after death this body will turn either into worms, into stool or into ashes. If
one kills poor animals to satisfy the temporary whims of this body, one does not know that he will suffer in his
next birth, for such a sinful miscreant must go to hell and suffer the results of his actions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the three words krmi-vid-bhasma are significant. After death, the body may become krmi, which
means "worms," for if the body is disposed of without cremation, it may be eaten by worms; or else it may be eaten
by animals like hogs and vultures and be turned into stool. Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and
thus it becomes ashes (bhasma-samjnitam). Yet although the body will be turned into worms, stool or ashes,
foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of
body is actually meant for jivasya tattva jijnasa, enlightenment in knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, one
must seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. Tasmad gurum prapadyeta: one must approach a guru. Who is a
guru? Sabde pare ca nisnatam (Bhag. 11.3.21): a guru is one who has full transcendental knowledge. Unless one
approaches a spiritual master, one remains in ignorance. Acaryavan puruso veda (Chandogya Upanisad 6.14.2):
one has full knowledge about life when one is acaryavan, controlled by the acarya. But when one is conducted by
rajo-guna and tamo-guna, one does not care about anything; instead, one acts like an ordinary foolish animal,
risking his life (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani) and therefore continuing to go through suffering after suffering. Na te
viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum (Bhag. 7.5.31). Such a foolish person does not know how to elevate himself in this
body. Instead, he indulges in sinful activities and goes deeper and deeper into hellish life.
