<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, Brahma, who resides in the higher planetary system in the sky, had observed the activities of
the most powerful Krsna in killing and delivering Aghasura, and he was astonished. Now that same Brahma wanted
to show some of his own power and see the power of Krsna, who was engaged in His childhood pastimes, playing
as if with ordinary cowherd boys. Therefore, in Krsna's absence, Brahma took all the boys and calves to another
place. Thus he became entangled, for in the very near future he would see how powerful Krsna was.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Aghasura was being killed by Krsna, who was accompanied by His associates, Brahma was astonished, but
when he saw that Krsna was very much enjoying His pastimes of lunch, he was even more astonished and wanted
to test whether Krsna was actually there. Thus he became entangled in Krsna's maya. After all, Brahma was born
materially. As mentioned here, ambhojanma janih: he was born of ambhoja, a lotus flower. It does not matter that
he was born of a lotus and not of any man, animal or material father. A lotus is also material, and anyone born
through the material energy must be subject to the four material deficiencies: bhrama (the tendency to commit
mistakes), pramada (the tendency to be illusioned), vipralipsa (the tendency to cheat) and karanapatava (imperfect
senses). Thus Brahma also became entangled.
Brahma, with his maya, wanted to test whether Krsna was actually present. These cowherd boys were but
expansions of Krsna's personal self (ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Later Krsna would show Brahma how
He expands Himself into everything as His personal pleasure, ananda-cinmaya-rasa. Hladini saktir asmat: Krsna has
a transcendental potency called hladini sakti. He does not enjoy anything that is a product of the material energy.
Brahma, therefore, would see Lord Krsna expand His energy.
Brahma wanted to take away Krsna's associates, but instead he took away some other boys and calves. Ravana
wanted to take away Sita, but that was impossible, and instead he took away a maya Sita. Similarly, Brahma took
away mayarbhakah: boys manifested by Krsna's maya. Brahma could show some extraordinary opulence to the
mayarbhakah; but he could not show any extraordinary potency to Krsna's associates. That he would see in the
very near future. Mayarbhakasya isituh. This bewilderment, this maya, was caused by the supreme controller,
prabhavatah--the all-potent Supreme person, Krsna--and we shall see the result. Anyone materially born is subject
to bewilderment. This pastime is therefore called brahma-vimohana-lila, the pastime of bewildering Brahma.
Mohitam nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam (Bg. 7.13). Materially born persons cannot fully understand
Krsna. Even the demigods cannot understand Him (muhyanti yat surayah). Tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye (Bhag.
1.1.1). Everyone, from Brahma down to the small insect, must take lessons from Krsna.
