<h2>Translation</h2>
Her hips were full, her breasts were large and firm, seeming to overburden her slim waist, and she was dressed
very nicely. Her hair, adorned with a garland of mallika flowers, was scattered about her beautiful face. Her
earrings were brilliant, and as she smiled very attractively, glancing upon everyone, her beauty drew the attention
of all the inhabitants of Vraja, especially the men. When the gopis saw her, they thought that the beautiful goddess
of fortune, holding a lotus flower in her hand, had come to see her husband, Krsna.
