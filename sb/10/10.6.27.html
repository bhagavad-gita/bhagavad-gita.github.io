<h2>Text</h2>
yavad autpatiko 'risto
vrajam nabhibhaved itah
tavad balan upadaya
yasyamo 'nyatra sanugah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yavat--so long; autpatikah--disturbing; aristah--the demon; vrajam--this Gokula Vrajabhumi; na--not; abhibhavet
itah--go away from this place; tavat--so long; balan upadaya--for the benefit of the boys; yasyamah--we shall go;
anyatra--somewhere else; sa-anugah--with our followers.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All these incidents are being caused by some unknown demon. Before he comes here to create another
disturbance, it is our duty to go somewhere else with the boys until there are no more disturbances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Upananda suggested, "By the mercy of Lord Visnu, Krsna has always been saved from so many dangerous
incidents. Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Visnu undisturbed, before
there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us." A devotee desires only that he may execute
devotional service undisturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of Krsna, when Nanda
Maharaja and the other cowherd men had the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were
disturbances. Of course, in every case, Krsna came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that
we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our Krsna
consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this
movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about Krsna consciousness
with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in Krsna's time.
