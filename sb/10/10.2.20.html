<h2>Text</h2>
tam viksya kamsah prabhayajitantaram
virocayantim bhavanam suci-smitam
ahaisa me prana-haro harir guham
dhruvam srito yan na pureyam idrsi
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--her (Devaki); viksya--after seeing; kamsah--her brother Kamsa; prabhaya--with the enhancement of her
beauty and influence; ajita-antaram--because of keeping Ajita, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, within
herself; virocayantim--illuminating; bhavanam--the whole atmosphere of the house; suci-smitam--smiling and
brilliant; aha--said to himself; esah--this (Supreme Person); me--my; prana-harah--who will kill me; harih--Lord
Visnu; guham--within the womb of Devaki; dhruvam--certainly; sritah--has taken shelter; yat--because; na--was
not; pura--formerly; iyam--Devaki; idrsi--like this.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was within her womb, Devaki illuminated the entire atmosphere in
the place where she was confined. Seeing her jubilant, pure and smiling, Kamsa thought, "The Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Visnu, who is now within her, will kill me. Devaki has never before looked so brilliant and jubilant."
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." In this age, at the present moment, there are inordinate discrepancies
in the discharge of human duties. Human life is meant for God realization, but unfortunately the materialistic
civilization is stressing only the senses of the body, not understanding the living force within the body. As clearly
stated in Bhagavad-gita (dehino 'smin yatha dehe), within the body is the body's proprietor, the living force, which
is more important. But human society has become so fallen that instead of understanding the living force within
the body, people have become busy with external things. This is a discrepancy in human duties. Therefore Krsna
has taken birth or taken shelter within the womb of the Krsna consciousness movement. Men of Kamsa's class,
therefore, are very much afraid and are busy trying to stop this movement, especially in the Western countries. One
politician has remarked that the Krsna consciousness movement is spreading like an epidemic and that if not
checked immediately, within ten years it may capture governmental power. There is, of course, such potency in the
Krsna consciousness movement. As stated by authorities (Cc. Adi 17.22), kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: in
this age, Krsna has appeared in the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. The Krsna consciousness movement is spreading like
wildfire all over the world, and it will go on doing so. Men who are like Kamsa are very much afraid of the
movement's progress and acceptance by the younger generation, but as Krsna could not be killed by Kamsa, this
movement cannot be checked by men of Kamsa's class. The movement will go on increasing more and more,
provided the leaders of the movement remain firmly Krsna conscious by following the regulative principles and the
primary activities of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra regularly.
