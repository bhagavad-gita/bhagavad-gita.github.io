<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead having spoken to the two demigods in this way,
they circumambulated the Lord, who was bound to the wooden mortar, and offered obeisances to Him. After
taking the permission of Lord Krsna, they returned to their respective homes.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees."
Chapter Eleven
The Childhood Pastimes of Krsna
This chapter describes how the inhabitants of Gokula left Gokula and went to Vrndavana and how Krsna killed
Vatsasura and Bakasura.
When the yamala-arjuna trees fell, they made a tremendous sound, like that of falling thunderbolts. Being
surprised, Krsna's father, Nanda, and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they saw the
fallen trees and Krsna standing between them, bound to the ulukhala, the wooden mortar. They could find no
cause for the trees' having fallen and Krsna's being there. They thought this might be the work of some other asura
who had met Krsna on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of Krsna about how the whole incident had
taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not
believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many
wonderful incidents in connection with Krsna. Anyway, Nanda Maharaja immediately released Krsna from the
ropes.
In this way, Krsna, at every day and every moment, displayed wonderful incidents to increase the parental
affection of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the yamala-arjunas
was one of these wonderful pastimes.
One day a fruit vendor approached Nanda Maharaja's house, and Krsna gathered some food grains with His little
palms and went to the vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains fell from His
palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in
exchange for as much fruit as Krsna could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and
jewels.
Thereafter, all the elderly gopas decided to leave Gokula because they saw that in Gokula there was always some
disturbance. They decided to go to Vrndavana, Vraja-dhama, and the next day they all departed. In Vrndavana,
both Krsna and Balarama, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send
them to the pasturing grounds (go-carana). During this time, a demon named Vatsasura entered among the calves
and was killed, and another asura, in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Krsna narrated all
these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, Krsna's playmates, but because of full
affection they enjoyed these narrations of Krsna's activities.
