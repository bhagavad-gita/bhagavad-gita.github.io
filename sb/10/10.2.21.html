<h2>Translation</h2>
Kamsa thought: What is my duty now? The Supreme Lord, who knows His purpose [paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam], will not give up His prowess. Devaki is a woman, she is my sister, and moreover she is now
pregnant. If I kill her, my reputation, opulence and duration of life will certainly be vanquished.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic principles, a woman, a brahmana, an old man, a child and a cow should never be killed. It
appears that Kamsa, although a great enemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was aware of the Vedic
culture and conscious of the fact that the soul transmigrates from one body to another and that one suffers in the
next life according to the karmas of this life. Therefore he was afraid of killing Devaki, since she was a woman, she
was his sister, and she was pregnant. A ksatriya becomes famous by performing heroic acts. But what would be
heroic about killing a woman who, while confined in his custody, was under his shelter? Therefore, he did not
want to act drastically by killing Devaki. Kamsa's enemy was within Devaki's womb, but killing an enemy in such a
nescient state would not be an exhibition of prowess. According to ksatriya rules, an enemy should be fought face
to face and with proper weapons. Then if the enemy is killed, the victor becomes famous. Kamsa very
conscientiously deliberated upon these facts and therefore refrained from killing Devaki, although he was
completely confident that his enemy had already appeared within her womb.
