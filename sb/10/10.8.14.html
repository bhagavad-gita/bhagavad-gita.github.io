<h2>Text</h2>
ity uktvadri-dari-kunjagahvaresv
atma-vatsakan
vicinvan bhagavan krsnah
sapani-kavalo yayau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti uktva--saying this ("Let Me bring your calves personally"); adri-dari-kunja-gahvaresu--everywhere in the
mountains, the mountain caves, the bushes and narrow places; atma-vatsakan--the calves belonging to His own
personal friends; vicinvan--searching out; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; krsnah--Lord Krsna; sapani-
kavalah--carrying His yogurt and rice in His hand; yayau--started out.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"Let Me go and search for the calves," Krsna said. "Don't disturb your enjoyment." Then, carrying His yogurt and
rice in His hand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, immediately went out to search for the calves of His
friends. To please His friends, He began searching in all the mountains, mountain caves, bushes and narrow
passages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) assert that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do
personally (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate) because He is doing everything through His energies and
potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). Nonetheless, here we see that He took personal care to find the calves
of His friends. This was Krsna's causeless mercy. Mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: all the affairs of the
entire world and the entire cosmic manifestation are working under His direction, through His different energies.
Still, when there is a need to take care of His friends, He does this personally. Krsna assured His friends, "Don't be
afraid. I am going personally to search for your calves." This was Krsna's causeless mercy.
