<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
krsnah--the Supreme Personality, Krsna; brahmanah--of Lord Brahma; adesam--the order; satyam--truthful;
kartum--to make; vraje--in Vrajabhumi, Vrndavana; vibhuh--the supreme powerful; saha-ramah--along with
Balarama; vasan--residing; cakre--increased; tesam--of all the inhabitants of Vrndavana; pritim--the pleasure; svalilaya--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the Supreme Personality, Krsna, along with Balarama, lived in Vrajabhumi, Vrndavana, just to substantiate
the benediction of Brahma. By exhibiting different pastimes in His childhood, He increased the transcendental
pleasure of Nanda and the other inhabitants of Vrndavana.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled,
"Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form Within His Mouth."
Chapter Nine
Mother Yasoda Binds Lord Lord Krsna
While mother Yasoda was allowing Krsna to drink her breast milk, she was forced to stop because she saw the
milk pan boiling over on the oven. The maidservants being engaged in other business, she stopped allowing Krsna
to drink from her breast and immediately attended to the overflowing milk pan. Krsna became very angry because
of His mother's behavior and devised a means of breaking the pots of yogurt. Because He created this disturbance,
mother Yasoda decided to bind Him. These incidents are described in this chapter.
One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother Yasoda was churning the yogurt into butter
herself, and in the meantime Krsna came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of course,
mother Yasoda immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over,
and therefore she immediately stopped allowing Krsna to drink the milk of her breast and went to stop the milk on
the oven from overflowing. Krsna, however, having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was
very angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a room, where He began to eat the freshly
churned butter. When mother Yasoda, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot broken,
she could understand that this was the work of Krsna, and therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered
the room, she saw Krsna standing on the ulukhala, a large mortar for grinding spices. Having turned the mortar
upside down, He was stealing butter hanging from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon
as Krsna saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, and mother Yasoda began to follow
Him. After going some distance, mother Yasoda was able to catch Krsna, who because of His offense was crying.
Mother Yasoda, of course, threatened to punish Krsna if He acted that way again, and she decided to bind Him with
rope. Unfortunately, when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to bind Him was short
by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again
saw that it was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again she found the rope too short by
two fingers. Thus she became very tired, and Krsna, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be
bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited potency. After mother Yasoda bound Krsna
and became engaged in other household affairs, Krsna observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were actually
Nalakuvara and Manigriva, two sons of Kuvera who had been condemned by Narada Muni to become trees. Krsna,
by His mercy, now began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of Narada Muni.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: One day when mother Yasoda saw that all the maidservants were engaged in
other household affairs, she personally began to churn the yogurt. While churning, she remembered the childish
activities of Krsna, and in her own way she composed songs and enjoyed singing to herself about all those
activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, quoting from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Sanatana Gosvami, says that the
incident of Krsna's breaking the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Yasoda took place on the Dipavali Day,
or Dipa-malika. Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of Kartika by
fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Maharaja,
several of mother Yasoda's cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk.
Mother Yasoda wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally,
since she thought that this child Krsna was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gopis to steal butter
because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared.
While churning the butter, mother Yasoda was singing about the childhood activities of Krsna. It was formerly a
custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done
by a professional poet. It appears that mother Yasoda did not want to forget Krsna's activities at any time. Therefore
she poeticized all of Krsna's childhood activities, such as the killing of Putana, Aghasura, Sakatasura and Trnavarta,
and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of
persons eager to remain Krsna conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how Krsna conscious
mother Yasoda was. To stay in Krsna consciousness, we should follow such persons.
