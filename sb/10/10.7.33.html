<h2>Translation</h2>
From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came out, illuminating all directions, and stayed
individually in the sky until Krsna came out from the corpse's mouth. Then, as all the demigods looked on, this
effulgence entered into Krsna's body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Apparently the serpent named Aghasura, because of having received association with Krsna, attained mukti by
entering Krsna's body. Entering the body of Krsna is called sayujya-mukti, but later verses prove that Aghasura,
like Dantavakra and others, received sarupya-mukti. This has been broadly described by Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura with references from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Jiva Gosvami. Aghasura attained sarupyamukti,
being promoted to the Vaikuntha planets to live with the same four-armed bodily features as Visnu. The
explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows.
The effulgence came out from the python's body and became purified, attaining spiritual suddha-sattva, freedom
from material contamination, because Krsna had stayed within the serpent's body, even after the serpent's death.
One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous activities, could attain the liberation of sarupya or sayujya,
and one may be astonished about this. But Krsna is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the
effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the
demigods.
Krsna is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the
effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon's body,
individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the brahmajyoti. The Brahman effulgence is not visible to
material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, Krsna had this individual effulgence stay outside
the demon's body for some time, for everyone to see. Then Krsna proved that anyone killed by Him attains
liberation, whether sayujya, sarupya, samipya or whatever.
But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is vimukti, special
liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of Krsna personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence.
This merging is called sayujya-mukti. But from later verses we find that Aghasura attained sarupya-mukti. Text 38
explains that Aghasura attained a body exactly like that of Visnu, and the verse after that also clearly states that he
attained a completely spiritual body like that of Narayana. Therefore in two or three places the Bhagavatam has
confirmed that Aghasura attained sarupya-mukti. One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman
effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained sarupya-mukti and association
with the Lord, Aghasura received a similar liberation.
