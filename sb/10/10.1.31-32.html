<h2>Translation</h2>
Devaki's father, King Devaka, was very much affectionate to his daughter. Therefore, while she and her husband
were leaving home, he gave her a dowry of four hundred elephants nicely decorated with golden garlands. He also
gave ten thousand horses, eighteen hundred chariots, and two hundred very beautiful young maidservants, fully
decorated with ornaments.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The system of giving a dowry to one's daughter has existed in Vedic civilization for a very long time. Even today,
following the same system, a father who has money will give his daughter an opulent dowry. A daughter would
never inherit the property of her father, and therefore an affectionate father, during the marriage of his daughter,
would give her as much as possible. A dowry, therefore, is never illegal according to the Vedic system. Here, of
course, the gift offered as a dowry by Devaka to Devaki was not ordinary. Because Devaka was a king, he gave a
dowry quite suitable to his royal position. Even an ordinary man, especially a high-class brahmana, ksatriya or
vaisya, is supposed to give his daughter a liberal dowry. Immediately after the marriage, the daughter goes to her
husband's house, and it is also a custom for the brother of the bride to accompany his sister and brother-in-law to
exhibit affection for her. This system was followed by Kamsa. These are all old customs in the society of
varnasrama-dharma, which is now wrongly designated as Hindu. These long-standing customs are nicely described
here.
