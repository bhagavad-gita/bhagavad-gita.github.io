The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who is situated as antaryami, the Supersoul, in the core of
everyone's heart, heard the boys talking among themselves about the artificial python. Unknown to them, it was
actually Aghasura, a demon who had appeared as a python. Krsna, knowing this, wanted to forbid His associates to
enter the demon's mouth.
