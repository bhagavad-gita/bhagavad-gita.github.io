tava canakadundubheh
devakya astamo garbho
na stri bhavitum arhati

api hanta gatasankas

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kamsah--King Kamsa; papa-matih--very, very sinful, having a polluted mind; sakhyam--friendship; tava--your;
ca--also; anaka-dundubheh--of Vasudeva; devakyah--of Devaki; astamah garbhah--the eighth pregnancy; na--not;
stri--a woman; bhavitum arhati--is possible to be; iti--in this way; sancintayan--considering; srutva--and hearing
(this news); devakyah--of Devaki; darika-vacah--the message from the daughter; api--although there was; hanta
gata-asankah--there is a possibility that Kamsa would take steps to kill this child; tarhi--therefore; tat--that
incident; nah--for us; anayah bhavet--may not be very good.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kamsa is both a great diplomat and a very sinful man. Therefore, having heard from Yogamaya, the daughter of
Devaki, that the child who will kill him has already been born somewhere else, having heard that the eighth
pregnancy of Devaki could not bring forth a female child, and having understood your friendship with Vasudeva,
Kamsa, upon hearing that the purificatory process has been performed by me, the priest of the Yadu dynasty, may
certainly consider all these points and suspect that Krsna is the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Then he might take
steps to kill Krsna. That would be a catastrophe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kamsa knew very well that Yogamaya was, after all, the maidservant of Krsna and Visnu and that although
Yogamaya had appeared as the daughter of Devaki, she might have been forbidden to disclose this fact. Actually
this was what had happened. Gargamuni argued very soberly that his taking part in performing the reformatory
process for Krsna would give rise to many doubts, so that Kamsa might take very severe steps to kill the child.
Kamsa had already sent many demons to attempt to kill this child, but none of them had survived. If Gargamuni
were to perform the purificatory process, Kamsa's suspicions would be fully confirmed, and he would take very
severe steps. Gargamuni gave this warning to Nanda Maharaja.
