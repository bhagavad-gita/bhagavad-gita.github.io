<h2>Text</h2>
tatas ca saurir bhagavat-pracoditah
sutam samadaya sa sutika-grhat
yada bahir gantum iyesa tarhy aja
ya yogamayajani nanda-jayaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--thereafter; ca--indeed; saurih--Vasudeva; bhagavat-pracoditah--being instructed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; sutam--his son; samadaya--carrying very carefully; sah--he; sutika-grhat--from the
maternity room; yada--when; bahih gantum--to go outside; iyesa--desired; tarhi--exactly at that time; aja--the
transcendental energy, who also never takes birth; ya--who; yogamaya--is known as Yogamaya; ajani--took birth;
nanda-jayaya--from the wife of Nanda Maharaja.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, exactly when Vasudeva, being inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to take the
newborn child from the delivery room, Yogamaya, the Lord's spiritual energy, took birth as the daughter of the
wife of Maharaja Nanda.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura discusses that Krsna appeared simultaneously as the son of Devaki and as
the son of Yasoda, along with the spiritual energy Yogamaya. As the son of Devaki, He first appeared as Visnu, and
because Vasudeva was not in the position of pure affection for Krsna, Vasudeva worshiped his son as Lord Visnu.
Yasoda, however, pleased her son Krsna without understanding His Godhood. This is the difference between Krsna
as the son of Yasoda and as the son of Devaki. This is explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti on the authority of Harivamsa.
