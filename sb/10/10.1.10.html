<h2>Text</h2>
arcisyanti manusyas tvam
sarva-kama-varesvarim
dhupopahara-balibhih
sarva-kama-vara-pradam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
arcisyanti--will worship; manusyah--human society; tvam--unto you; sarva-kama-vara-isvarim--because you are
the best of the demigods who can fulfill all material desires; dhupa--by incense; upahara--by presentations;
balibhih--by different types of worship through sacrifice; sarva-kama--of all material desires; vara--the blessings;
pradam--one who can bestow.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By sacrifices of animals, ordinary human beings will worship you gorgeously, with various paraphernalia, because
you are supreme in fulfilling the material desires of everyone.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah: "Those whose minds are
distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods." Therefore the word manusya, meaning "human being,"
here refers to one who does not know the actual goal of life. Such a person wants to enjoy the material world by
taking birth in a highly elevated family with the benefits of education, beauty and immense wealth, which in this
material world are desirable. One who has forgotten the real aim of life may worship goddess Durga, maya-sakti,
under various names, for different purposes, and in different places. As there are many holy places for the worship
of Krsna, there are also many holy places in India for the worship of Durgadevi, or Mayadevi, who took birth as the
daughter of Yasoda. After cheating Kamsa, Mayadevi dispersed herself to various places, especially in Vindhyacala,
to accept regular worship from ordinary men. A human being should actually be interested in understanding atmatattva,
the truth of atma, the spirit soul, and Paramatma, the supreme soul. Those who are interested in atma-tattva
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati). However, as
explained in the next verse of this chapter, those who cannot understand atma-tattva (apasyatam atma-tattvam)
worship Yogamaya in her different features. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.2) says:
srotavyadini rajendra
nrnam santi sahasrasah
apasyatam atma-tattvam
grhesu grha-medhinam
"Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject
matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." Those who are interested in remaining in this material world
and are not interested in spiritual salvation have many duties, but for one who is interested in spiritual salvation,
the only duty is to surrender fully unto Krsna (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). Such a person
is not interested in material enjoyment.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Krsna blessed Mayadevi by saying: In different places on the surface of the earth, people will give you
different names, such as Durga, Bhadrakali, Vijaya, Vaisnavi, Kumuda, Candika, Krsna, Madhavi, Kanyaka, Maya,
Narayani, Isani, Sarada and Ambika.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because Krsna and His energy appeared simultaneously, people have generally formed two groups--the saktas and
the Vaisnavas--and sometimes there is rivalry between them. Essentially, those who are interested in material
enjoyment are saktas, and those interested in spiritual salvation and attaining the spiritual kingdom are Vaisnavas.
Because people are generally interested in material enjoyment, they are interested in worshiping Mayadevi, the
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaisnavas, however, are suddha-saktas, or pure bhaktas, because
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra indicates worship of the Supreme Lord's energy, Hara. A Vaisnava prays to the energy
of the Lord for the opportunity to serve the Lord along with His spiritual energy. Thus Vaisnavas all worship such
Deities as Radha-Krsna, Sita-Rama, Laksmi-Narayana and Rukmini-Dvarakadhisa, whereas durga-saktas worship
the material energy under different names.
The names by which Mayadevi is known in different places have been listed by Vallabhacarya as follows. In
Varanasi she is known as Durga, in Avanti she is known as Bhadrakali, in Orissa she is known as Vijaya, and in
Kulahapura she is known as Vaisnavi or Mahalaksmi. (The representatives of Mahalaksmi and Ambika are present
in Bombay.) In the country known as Kamarupa she is known as Candika, in Northern India as Sarada, and in
Cape Comorin as Kanyaka. Thus she is distributed according to various names in various places.
Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirthapada, in his pada-ratnavali-tika, has explained the meanings of the different
representations. Maya is known as Durga because she is approached with great difficulty, as Bhadra because she is
auspicious, and as Kali because she is deep blue. Because she is the most powerful energy, she is known as Vijaya;
because she is one of the different energies of Visnu, she is known as Vaisnavi; and because she enjoys in this
material world and gives facilities for material enjoyment, she is known as Kumuda. Because she is very severe to
her enemies, the asuras, she is known as Candika, and because she gives all sorts of material facilities, she is called
Krsna. In this way the material energy is differently named and situated in different places on the surface of the
globe.
