<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, when a man persecutes great souls, all his benedictions of longevity, beauty, fame, religion,
blessings and promotion to higher planets will be destroyed.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Atrocities of King Kamsa."
Chapter Five
The Meeting of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva
As described in this chapter, Nanda Maharaja very gorgeously performed the birth ceremony for his newborn
child. Then he went to Kamsa to pay taxes due and met his intimate friend Vasudeva.
There was great jubilation all over Vrndavana due to Krsna's birth. Everyone was overwhelmed with joy.
Therefore the King of Vraja, Maharaja Nanda, wanted to perform the birth ceremony for his child, and this he did.
During this great festival, Nanda Maharaja gave in charity to all present whatever they desired. After the festival,
Nanda Maharaja put the cowherd men in charge of protecting Gokula, and then he went to Mathura to pay official
taxes to Kamsa. In Mathura, Nanda Maharaja met Vasudeva. Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva were brothers, and
Vasudeva praised Nanda Maharaja's good fortune because he knew that Krsna had accepted Nanda Maharaja as His
father. When Vasudeva inquired from Nanda Maharaja about the welfare of the child, Nanda Maharaja informed
him all about Vrndavana, and Vasudeva was very much satisfied by this, although he expressed his grief because
Devaki's many children had been killed by Kamsa. Nanda Maharaja consoled Vasudeva by saying that everything
happens according to destiny and that one who knows this is not aggrieved. Expecting many disturbances in
Gokula, Vasudeva then advised Nanda Maharaja not to wait in Mathura, but to return to Vrndavana as soon as
possible. Thus Nanda Maharaja took leave of Vasudeva and returned to Vrndavana with the other cowherd men on
their bullock carts.
