<h2>Text</h2>
na te tad-uktam jagrhur
na ghateteti tasya tat
balasyotpatanam tarvoh
kecit sandigdha-cetasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; te--all the gopas; tat-uktam--being spoken by the boys; jagrhuh--would accept; na ghateta--it cannot be;
iti--thus; tasya--of Krsna; tat--the activity; balasya--of a small boy like Krsna; utpatanam--the uprooting; tarvoh--of
the two trees; kecit--some of them; sandigdha-cetasah--became doubtful about what could be done (because
Gargamuni had predicted that this child would be equal to Narayana).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of intense paternal affection, the cowherd men, headed by Nanda, could not believe that Krsna could
have uprooted the trees in such a wonderful way. Therefore they could not put their faith in the words of the boys.
Some of the men, however, were in doubt. "Since Krsna was predicted to equal Narayana," they thought, "it might
be that He could have done it."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One view was that it was impossible for a small boy like this to have done such a thing as pulling down the trees.
But there were doubts because Krsna had been predicted to equal Narayana. Therefore the cowherd men were in a
dilemma.
