<h2>Translation</h2>
His lower lip rested on the surface of the earth, and his upper lip was touching the clouds in the sky. The borders
of his mouth resembled the sides of a big cave in a mountain, and the middle of his mouth was as dark as possible.
His tongue resembled a broad traffic-way, his breath was like a warm wind, and his eyes blazed like fire.
