<h2>Translation</h2>
When the cowherd men and women heard about the killing of Bakasura in the forest, they were very much
astonished. Upon seeing Krsna and hearing the story, they received Krsna very eagerly, thinking that Krsna and the
other boys had returned from the mouth of death. Thus they looked upon Krsna and the boys with silent eyes, not
wanting to turn their eyes aside now that the boys were safe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because of intense love for Krsna, the cowherd men and women simply remained silent, thinking of how Krsna
and the boys had been saved. The cowherd men and women looked upon Krsna and the boys and did not desire to
turn their eyes aside.
