<h2>Translation</h2>
When Lord Sri Krsna saw His mother, stick in hand, He very quickly got down from the top of the mortar and
began to flee as if very much afraid. Although yogis try to capture Him as Paramatma by meditation, desiring to
enter into the effulgence of the Lord with great austerities and penances, they fail to reach Him. But mother Yasoda,
thinking that same Personality of Godhead, Krsna, to be her son, began following Krsna to catch Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Yogis, mystics, want to catch Krsna as Paramatma, and with great austerities and penances they try to approach
Him, yet they cannot. Here we see, however, that Krsna is going to be caught by Yasoda and is running away in
fear. This illustrates the difference between the bhakta and the yogi. Yogis cannot reach Krsna, but for pure
devotees like mother Yasoda, Krsna is already caught. Krsna was even afraid of mother Yasoda's stick. This was
mentioned by Queen Kunti in her prayers: bhaya-bhavanaya sthitasya (Bhag. 1.8.31). Krsna is afraid of mother
Yasoda, and yogis are afraid of Krsna. Yogis try to reach Krsna by jnana-yoga and other yogas, but fail. Yet although
mother Yasoda was a woman, Krsna was afraid of her, as clearly described in this verse.
