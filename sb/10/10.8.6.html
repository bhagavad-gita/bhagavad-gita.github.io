<h2>Text</h2>
tvam hi brahma-vidam sresthah
samskaran kartum arhasi
balayor anayor nrnam
janmana brahmano guruh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvam--Your Holiness; hi--indeed; brahma-vidam--of all brahmanas, or persons who understand what is Brahman
(brahma janatiti brahmanah); sresthah--you are the best; samskaran--ceremonies performed for reformation
(because by these reformatory activities one takes one's second birth: samskarad bhaved dvijah); kartum arhasi--
because you have kindly come here, kindly execute; balayoh--of these two sons (Krsna and Balarama); anayoh--of
both of Them; nrnam--not only of Them, but of all human society; janmana--as soon as he takes birth;
brahmanah--immediately the brahmana becomes; guruh--the guide. *
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My lord, you are the best of the brahmanas, especially because you are fully aware of the jyotih-sastra, the
astrological science. Therefore you are naturally the spiritual master of every human being. This being so, since you
have kindly come to my house, kindly execute the reformatory activities for my two sons.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam gunakarma-
vibhagasah: the four varnas--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--must be present in society. The
brahmanas are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as varnasrama-dharma
and if human society has no such guide as the brahmana, human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at
the present moment, there is no such thing as a real brahmana, and therefore society is in a chaotic condition.
Formerly there were qualified brahmanas, but at present, although there are certainly persons who think
themselves brahmanas, they actually have no ability to guide society. The Krsna consciousness movement is
therefore very much eager to reintroduce the varnasrama system into human society so that those who are
bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified brahmanas.
Brahmana means Vaisnava. After one becomes a brahmana, the next stage of development in human society is to
become a Vaisnava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must
understand Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this
principle, but people have lost the clue (na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum), and they are simply pursuing sense
gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a lower grade of life (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani). It doesn't matter
whether one is born a brahmana or not. No one is born a brahmana; everyone is born a sudra. But by the guidance
of a brahmana and by samskara, one can become dvija, twice-born, and then gradually become a brahmana.
Brahmanism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated
so as to become a brahmana. At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of
life. Regardless of whether one is born in a brahmana family, a ksatriya family or a sudra family, one may be guided
by a proper brahmana and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vaisnava. Thus the Krsna consciousness
movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Maharaja took advantage
of the opportunity of Gargamuni's presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for
his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life.
