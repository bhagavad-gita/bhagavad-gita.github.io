<h2>Text</h2>
yavanto gokule balah
sa-vatsah sarva eva hi
mayasaye sayana me
nadyapi punar utthitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yavantah--whatsoever, as many as; gokule--in Gokula; balah--boys; sa-vatsah--along with their calves; sarve--all;
eva--indeed; hi--because; maya-asaye--on the bed of maya; sayanah--are sleeping; me--my; na--not; adya--today;
api--even; punah--again; utthitah--have risen.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma thought: Whatever boys and calves there were in Gokula, I have kept them sleeping on the bed of
my mystic potency, and to this very day they have not yet risen again.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
For one year Lord Brahma kept the calves and boys lying down in a cave by his mystic power. Therefore when
Brahma saw Lord Krsna still playing with all the cows and calves, he began trying to reason about what was
happening. "What is this?" he thought. "Maybe I took those calves and cowherd boys away but now they have been
taken from that cave. Is this what has happened? Has Krsna brought them back here?" Then, however, Lord
Brahma saw that the calves and boys he had taken were still in the same mystic maya into which he had put them.
Thus he concluded that the calves and cowherd boys now playing with Krsna were different from the ones in the
cave. He could understand that although the original calves and boys were still in the cave where he had put them,
Krsna had expanded Himself and so the present demonstration of calves and boys consisted of expansions of
Krsna. They had the same features, the same mentality and the same intentions, but they were all Krsna.
