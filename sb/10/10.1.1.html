<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the end of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, Sukadeva Gosvami summarized the activities of Krsna.
He spoke of how Krsna had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His
pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabhumi-lila.
Pariksit Maharaja, being naturally a devotee of Krsna, wanted to hear more about Lord Krsna. Therefore, to
encourage Sukadeva Gosvami to continue speaking about Krsna and give further details, he thanked Sukadeva
Gosvami for having described the activities of Krsna in brief. Sukadeva Gosvami had said:
jato gatah pitr-grhad vrajam edhitartho
hatva ripun suta-satani krtorudarah
utpadya tesu purusah kratubhih samije
atmanam atma-nigamam prathayan janesu
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-purusottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva
but immediately left His father's home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving relationships with His
confidential devotees. In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterward He returned to Dvaraka, where
according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds
of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life." (Bhag.
9.24.66)
The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems
are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Pariksit Maharaja gave more respect to the dynasty of the
moon-god, the soma-vamsa, because in the Yadava dynasty, descending from the moon, Krsna had appeared. There
are two different ksatriya families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the
other descending from the king of the sun. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally
appears in a ksatriya family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness.
According to the Vedic system, the ksatriya family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme
Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord Ramacandra, He appeared in the surya-vamsa, the family descending
from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord Krsna, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or yadu-vamsa, whose
descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, there is a
long list of the kings of the yadu-vamsa. All the kings in both the soma-vamsa and surya-vamsa were great and
powerful, and Maharaja Pariksit praised them very highly (rajnam cobhaya-vamsyanam caritam paramadbhutam).
Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the soma-vamsa because that was the dynasty in which Krsna had
appeared.
The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described in Brahma-samhita as the abode of
cintamani: cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-laksavrtesu surabhir abhipalayantam. The Vrndavana-dhama
on this earth is a replica of that same abode. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.20), in the spiritual sky there is another,
eternal nature, transcendental to manifested and unmanifested matter. The manifested world can be seen in the
form of many stars and planets such as the sun and moon, but beyond this is the unmanifested, which is
imperceptible to those who are embodied. And beyond this unmanifested matter is the spiritual kingdom, which is
described in Bhagavad-gita as supreme and eternal. That kingdom is never annihilated. Although material nature is
subject to repeated creation and annihilation, that spiritual nature remains as it is eternally. In the Tenth Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, that spiritual nature, the spiritual world, is described as Vrndavana, Goloka Vrndavana or
Vraja-dhama. The elaborate description of the above-mentioned sloka from the Ninth Canto--jato gatah pitrgrhad--
will be found here, in the Tenth Canto.
