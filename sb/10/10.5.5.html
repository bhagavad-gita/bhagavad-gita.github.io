tam ankam arudham apayayat stanam
sneha-snutam sa-smitam iksati mukham
atrptam utsrjya javena sa yayav
utsicyamane payasi tv adhisrite
SYNONYMS
tam--unto Krsna; ankam arudham--very affectionately allowing Him to sit down on her lap; apayayat--allowed to
drink; stanam--her breast; sneha-snutam--which was flowing with milk because of intense affection; sa-smitam
iksati mukham--mother Yasoda was smiling and observing the smiling face of Krsna; atrptam--Krsna, who was still
not fully satisfied by drinking the milk; utsrjya--putting Him aside; javena--very hastily; sa--mother Yasoda; yayau--
left that place; utsicyamane payasi--because of seeing that the milk was overflowing; tu--but; adhisrite--in the milk
pan on the oven.
TRANSLATION
Mother Yasoda then embraced Krsna, allowed Him to sit down on her lap, and began to look upon the face of the
Lord with great love and affection. Because of her intense affection, milk was flowing from her breast. But when
she saw that the milk pan on the oven was boiling over, she immediately left her son to take care of the overflowing
milk, although the child was not yet fully satisfied with drinking the milk of His mother's breast.
PURPORT
Everything in the household affairs of mother Yasoda was meant for Krsna. Although Krsna was drinking the
breast milk of mother Yasoda, when she saw that the milk pan in the kitchen was overflowing, she had to take care
of it immediately, and thus she left her son, who then became very angry, not having been fully satisfied with
drinking the milk of her breast. Sometimes one must take care of more than one item of important business for the
same purpose. Therefore mother Yasoda was not unjust when she left her son to take care of the overflowing milk.
On the platform of love and affection, it is the duty of the devotee to do one thing first and other things later. The
proper intuition by which to do this is given by Krsna.
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
(Bg. 10.10)
In Krsna consciousness, everything is dynamic. Krsna guides the devotee in what to do first and what to do next
on the platform of absolute truth.
