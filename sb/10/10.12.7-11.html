<h2>Translation</h2>
All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn.
Some imitated the buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the cuckoo. Some boys imitated
flying birds by running after the birds' shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful movements and
attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of
the peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys,
some made faces as the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one branch to another. Some
boys went to the waterfalls and crossed over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their own
reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way,
all the cowherd boys used to play with Krsna, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence for jnanis desiring to
merge into that effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for devotees who have accepted eternal
servitorship, and who for ordinary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys, having accumulated
the results of pious activities for many lives, were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As recommended by Srila Rupa Gosvami, tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet (Bhakti-rasamrtasindhu
1.2.4). Somehow or other, whether one thinks of Krsna as an ordinary human child, as the source of the
Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Paramatma, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should
concentrate one's full attention upon the lotus feet of Krsna. That is also the instruction of Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the easiest way of directly approaching
Krsna. Isvarah sadyo hrdy avarudhyate 'tra krtibhih susrusubhis tat-ksanat (Bhag. 1.1.2). Diverting even a little of
one's attention toward Krsna and activities in Krsna consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest
perfection of life. This is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness movement. Lokasyajanato vidvams cakre satvatasamhitam
(Bhag. 1.7.6). The secret of success is unknown to people in general, and therefore Srila Vyasadeva,
being compassionate toward the poor souls in this material world, especially in this age of Kali, has given us the
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-bhagavatam puranam amalam yad vaisnavanam priyam (Bhag. 12.13.18). For
Vaisnavas who are somewhat advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the Lord, Srimad-
Bhagavatam is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we have to change this body (tatha dehantara-praptih). If we do
not care about Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, we do not know what the next body will be. But if one
adheres to these two books--Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam--one is sure to obtain the association of Krsna
in the next life (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna). Therefore, distribution of Srimad-Bhagavatam
all over the world is a great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists and yogis (yoginam
api sarvesam), as well as for people in general. Janma-labhah parah pumsam ante narayana-smrtih (Bhag. 2.1.6): if
we can somehow or other remember Krsna, Narayana, at the end of life, our life will be successful.
