<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, Lord of the demigods, after hearing the prophecy that You would take birth in our home and kill
him, this uncivilized Kamsa killed so many of Your elder brothers. As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that
You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kamsa has here been described as asabhya, meaning "uncivilized" or "most heinous," because he killed the many
children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man,
Kamsa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can
do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill brahmanas, he can
kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and
brahmanas should be excused if they are at fault. But asuras, uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the
present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this
civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized asuras.
Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the Krsna consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare
without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare Krsna movement is a nuisance, although Bhagavad-gita clearly
says, satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah. According to this verse, it is the duty of the mahatmas to
chant the Hare Krsna mantra and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately,
society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called mahatmas who are prepared to kill cows and children
and stop the Hare Krsna movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the
Hare Krsna movement's Bombay center, Hare Krsna Land. As Kamsa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of
Devaki and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the Krsna
consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways.
Although Krsna cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of Krsna, was trembling because in affection he thought
that Kamsa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the Krsna consciousness movement and
Krsna are not different and no asuras can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the asuras can stop this
movement in any part of the world.
