<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma informed the demigods: Before we submitted our petition to the Lord, He was already aware of the
distress on earth. Consequently, for as long as the Lord moves on earth to diminish its burden by His own potency
in the form of time, all of you demigods should appear through plenary portions as sons and grandsons in the
family of the Yadus.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.39):
ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan
nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu
krsnah svayam samabhavat paramah puman yo
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is always situated in various incarnations such as
Rama, Nrsimha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original personality of Godhead, known as
Krsna, and who incarnates personally also."
In this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam we find the words puraiva pumsavadhrto dhara jvarah. The word pumsa
refers to Krsna, who was already aware of how the whole world was suffering because of the increase of demons.
Without reference to the supreme power of the Personality of Godhead, demons assert themselves to be
independent kings and presidents, and thus they create a disturbance by increasing their military power. When
such disturbances are very prominent, Krsna appears. At present also, various demoniac states all over the world
are increasing their military power in many ways, and the whole situation has become distressful. Therefore Krsna
has appeared by His name, in the Hare Krsna movement, which will certainly diminish the burden of the world.
Philosophers, religionists, and people in general must take to this movement very seriously, for man-made plans
and devices will not help bring peace on earth. The transcendental sound Hare Krsna is not different from the
person Krsna.
nama cintamanih krsnas
caitanya-rasa-vigrahah
purnah suddho nitya-mukto
'bhinnatvan nama-naminoh
(Padma Purana)
There is no difference between the sound Hare Krsna and Krsna the person.
