<h2>Text</h2>
evam sva-geha-damani
yasoda sandadhaty api
gopinam susmayantinam
smayanti vismitabhavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this manner; sva-geha-damani--all the ropes available in the household; yasoda--mother Yasoda;
sandadhati api--although she was joining one after another; gopinam--when all the other elderly gopi friends of
mother Yasoda; su-smayantinam--were all taking pleasure in this funny affair; smayanti--mother Yasoda was also
smiling; vismita abhavat--all of them were struck with wonder.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus mother Yasoda joined whatever ropes were available in the household, but still she failed in her attempt to
bind Krsna. Mother Yasoda's friends, the elderly gopis in the neighborhood, were smiling and enjoying the fun.
Similarly, mother Yasoda, although laboring in that way, was also smiling. All of them were struck with wonder.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually this incident was wonderful because Krsna was only a child with small hands. To bind Him should have
required only a rope not more than two feet long. All the ropes in the house combined together might have been
hundreds of feet long, but still He was impossible to bind, for all the ropes together were still too short. Naturally
mother Yasoda and her gopi friends thought, "How is this possible?" Seeing this funny affair, all of them were
smiling. The first rope was short by a measurement the width of two fingers, and after the second rope was added,
it was still two fingers too short. If the shortness of all the ropes were added together, it must have amounted to the
width of hundreds of fingers. Certainly this was astonishing. This was another exhibition of Krsna's inconceivable
potency to His mother and His mother's friends.
