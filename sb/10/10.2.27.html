<h2>Text</h2>
ekayano 'sau dvi-phalas tri-mulas
catu-rasah panca-vidhah sad-atma
sapta-tvag asta-vitapo navakso
dasa-cchadi dvi-khago hy adi-vrksah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
eka-ayanah--the body of an ordinary living being is fully dependent on the material elements; asau--that; dviphalah--
in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mulah--having
three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created; catuhrasah--
four rasas, or tastes; panca-vidhah--consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose,
tongue and touch); sat-atma--six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); saptatvak--
having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); asta-vitapah--eight branches (the
five gross elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-aksah--nine
holes; dasa-chadi--ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagah--two birds (the individual soul
and the Supersoul); hi--indeed; adi-vrksah --this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether
individual or universal.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the
original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit--the
enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association
with the three modes of material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four
tastes--religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation--which are experienced through five
senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and
thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the
eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements--earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,
intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows--the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the
rectum and the genitals--and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two
birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This material world is composed of five principal elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--all of which are
emanations from Krsna. Although materialistic scientists may accept these five primary elements as the cause of the
material manifestation, these elements in their gross and subtle states are produced by Krsna, whose marginal
potency also produces the living entities working within this material world. The Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita
clearly states that the entire cosmic manifestation is a combination of two of Krsna's energies--the superior energy
and the inferior energy. The living entities are the superior energy, and the inanimate material elements are His
inferior energy. In the dormant stage, everything rests in Krsna.
Material scientists cannot give such a thorough analysis of the material structure of the body. The analysis of the
material scientists concerns itself only with inanimate matter, but this is inadequate because the living entity is
completely separate from the material bodily structure. In Bhagavad-gita (7.5) the Lord says:
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all the
living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Although the material
elements emanate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, they are separated elements and are sustained
by the living elements.
As indicated by the word dvi-khagah, the living elements within the body resemble two birds in a tree. Kha
means "sky," and ga means "one who flies." Thus the word dvi-khagah refers to birds. In the tree of the body there
are two birds, or two living elements, and they are always different. In Bhagavad-gita (13.3), the Lord says, ksetra
jnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: "O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the
knower in all bodies." The ksetra jna, the owner of the body, is also called the khaga, the living entity. Within the
body there are two such ksetra jnas--the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is the owner of his
individual body, but the Supersoul is present within the bodies of all living entities. Such a thorough analysis and
understanding of the bodily structure cannot be obtained anywhere but in the Vedic literature.
When two birds enter a tree, one may foolishly think that the birds become one or merge with the tree, but
actually they do not. Rather, each bird keeps its individual identity. Similarly, the individual soul and the Supersoul
do not become one, nor do they merge with matter. The living entity lives close to matter, but this does not mean
that he merges or mixes with it (asango hy ayam purusah), although material scientists mistakenly see the organic
and inorganic, or animate and inanimate, to be mixed.
Vedic knowledge has been kept imprisoned or concealed, but every human being needs to understand it in truth.
The modern civilization of ignorance is simply engaged in analyzing the body, and thus people come to the
erroneous conclusion that the living force within the body is generated under certain material conditions. People
have no information of the soul, but this verse gives the perfect explanation that there are two living forces (dvikhaga):
the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Supersoul is present in every body (isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati), whereas the individual soul is situated only in his own body (dehi) and is transmigrating
from one body to another.
