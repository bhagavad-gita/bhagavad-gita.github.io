<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Lord Brahma returned after a moment of time had passed (according to his own measurement), he saw
that although by human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord Krsna, after all that time, was engaged just
as before in playing with the boys and calves, who were His expansions.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had
passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may
orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes
twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahma was one year on earth.
Krsna continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of yogamaya no one
could understand this but Balarama.
After one moment of Brahma's calculation, Brahma came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and
calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. Krsna was his master, and he had played mischief for
fun by taking away Krsna's calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back
after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahma returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing
with Krsna in the same way as when he had come upon them; by Krsna's display of yogamaya, the same pastimes
were going on without any change.
On the day when Lord Brahma had first come, Baladeva could not go with Krsna and the cowherd boys, for it was
His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called santika-snana. Therefore
Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahma at that time. Now, one year later, Brahma returned, and because he
returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse
mentions that Brahma saw Krsna and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days
earlier that Baladeva had inquired from Krsna about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but
now, when Brahma returned, Brahma saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with Krsna as expansions of
Krsna, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord
Brahma appeared there.
