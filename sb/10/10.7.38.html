<h2>Text</h2>
naitad vicitram manujarbha-mayinah
paravaranam paramasya vedhasah
agho 'pi yat-sparsana-dhauta-patakah
prapatma-samyam tv asatam sudurlabham
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; etat--this; vicitram--is wonderful; manuja-arbha-mayinah--of Krsna, who appeared as the son of Nanda
Maharaja and Yasoda, being compassionate upon them; para-avaranam--of all causes and effects; paramasya
vedhasah--of the supreme creator; aghah api--Aghasura also; yat-sparsana--simply by the slight association of
whom; dhauta-patakah--became freed from all contamination of material existence; prapa--became elevated; atmasamyam--
to a body exactly resembling that of Narayana; tu--but; asatam sudurlabham--which is not at all possible
to be obtained by contaminated souls (but everything can be possible by the mercy of the Supreme Lord).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Krsna is the cause of all causes. The causes and effects of the material world, both higher and lower, are all
created by the Supreme Lord, the original controller. When Krsna appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda, He did so by His causeless mercy. Consequently, for Him to exhibit His unlimited opulence was not at all
wonderful. Indeed, He showed such great mercy that even Aghasura, the most sinful miscreant, was elevated to
being one of His associates and achieving sarupya-mukti, which is actually impossible for materially contaminated
persons to attain.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word maya is also used in connection with love. Out of maya, love, a father has affection for his child.
Therefore the word mayinah indicates that Krsna, out of love, appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaja and assumed
the form of a human child (manujarbha). Krsna is the cause of all causes. He is the creator of cause and effect, and
He is the supreme controller. Nothing is impossible for Him. Therefore, that He enabled even a living being like
Aghasura to attain the salvation of sarupya-mukti was not at all wonderful for Krsna. Krsna took pleasure in
entering the mouth of Aghasura in a sporting spirit along with His associates. Therefore, when Aghasura, by that
sporting association, as maintained in the spiritual world, was purified of all contamination, he attained sarupyamukti
and vimukti by the grace of Krsna. For Krsna this was not at all wonderful.
