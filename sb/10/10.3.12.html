<h2>Translation</h2>
After the strong, stout cowherd men assembled the pots and paraphernalia on the handcart and set it up as
before, the brahmanas performed a ritualistic ceremony with a fire sacrifice to appease the bad planet, and then,
with rice grains, kusa, water and curd, they worshiped the Supreme Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The handcart was loaded with heavy utensils and other paraphernalia. To set the cart back in its original position
required much strength, but this was easily done by the cowherd men. Then, according to the system of the gopa
jati, various Vedic ceremonies were performed to appease the calamitous situation.

<h2>Translation</h2>
When brahmanas are free from envy, untruthfulness, unnecessary pride, grudges, disturbance by the opulence of
others, and false prestige, their blessings never go in vain. Considering this, Nanda Maharaja soberly took Krsna on
his lap and invited such truthful brahmanas to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to the holy hymns of the
Sama Veda, Rg Veda and Yajur Veda. Then, while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with water
mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the brahmanas with first-class
grains and other food.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja was very confident about the qualifications of the brahmanas and their blessings. He was fully
confident that simply if the good brahmanas showered their blessings, the child Krsna would be happy. The
blessings of qualified brahmanas can bring happiness not only to Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but
to everyone. Because Krsna is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone's blessings, yet Nanda Maharaja thought
that Krsna required the blessings of the brahmanas. What then is to be said of others? In human society, therefore,
there must be an ideal class of men, brahmanas, who can bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the ksatriyas,
vaisyas and sudras, so that everyone will be happy. Krsna therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13) that human society
must have four social orders (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah); it is not that everyone should
become a sudra or a vaisya and human society will prosper. As enunciated in Bhagavad-gita, there must be a class
of brahmanas with qualities like satya (truthfulness), sama (peacefulness), dama (self-control) and titiksa
(tolerance).
Here also, in the Bhagavatam, Nanda Maharaja invites qualified brahmanas. There may be caste brahmanas, and
we have all respect for them, but their birth in brahmana families does not mean that they are qualified to bestow
blessings upon the other members of human society. This is the verdict of the sastras. In Kali-yuga, caste
brahmanas are accepted as brahmanas. Vipratve sutram eva hi (Bhag. 12.2.3): in Kali-yuga, simply by putting on a
thread worth two paise, one becomes a brahmana. Such brahmanas were not called for by Nanda Maharaja. As
stated by Narada Muni (Bhag. 7.11.35), yasya yal laksanam proktam. The symptoms of a brahmana are stated in
sastra, and one must be qualified with these symptoms.
The blessings of brahmanas who are not envious, disturbed or puffed up with pride and false prestige and who
are fully qualified with truthfulness will be useful. Therefore a class of men must be trained as brahmanas from the
very beginning. Brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto guror hitam (Bhag. 7.12.1). The word dantah is very important.
Dantah refers to one who is not envious, disturbing or puffed up with false prestige. With the Krsna consciousness
movement, we are trying to introduce such brahmanas in society. Brahmanas must ultimately be Vaisnavas, and if
one is a Vaisnava, he has already acquired the qualifications of a brahmana. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma (Bg.
18.54). The word brahma-bhuta refers to becoming a brahmana, or understanding what is Brahman (brahma
janatiti brahmanah). One who is brahma-bhuta is always happy (prasannatma). Na socati na kanksati: he is never
disturbed about material necessities. Samah sarvesu bhutesu: he is ready to bestow blessings upon everyone
equally. Mad-bhaktim labhate param: then he becomes a Vaisnava. In this age, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vaisnava disciples, with the idea that people should
understand that when one becomes a Vaisnava he has already acquired the qualifications of a brahmana. Therefore
in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those who are twice initiated so as to become brahmanas
must bear in mind their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be tolerant, and so on.
Then their life will be successful. It was such brahmanas that Nanda Maharaja invited to chant the Vedic hymns,
not ordinary brahmanas. Verse thirteen distinctly mentions himsa-mana. The word mana refers to false prestige or
false pride. Those who were falsely proud, thinking that they were brahmanas because they were born in brahmana
families, were never invited by Nanda Maharaja on such occasions.
Verse fourteen mentions pavitrausadhi. In any ritualistic ceremony, many herbs and leaves were required. These
were known as pavitra-patra. Sometimes there were nimba leaves, sometimes bael leaves, mango leaves, asvattha
leaves or amalaki leaves. Similarly, there were panca-gavya, panca-sasya and panca-ratna. Although Nanda
Maharaja belonged to the vaisya community, everything was known to him.
The most important word in these verses is maha-gunam, indicating that the brahmanas were offered very
palatable food of exalted quality. Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely food
grains and milk products. Bhagavad-gita (18.44) therefore enjoins that human society must give protection to the
cows and encourage agriculture (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam). Simply by expert cooking,
hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes can be prepared from agricultural produce and milk products. This is
indicated here by the words annam maha-gunam. Still today in India, from these two things, namely food grains
and milk, hundreds and thousands of varieties of food are prepared, and then they are offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. (Catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada. patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya
prayacchati.) Then the prasada is distributed. Even today in Jagannatha-ksetra and other big temples, very palatable
dishes are offered to the Deity, and prasada is distributed profusely. Cooked by first-class brahmanas with expert
knowledge and then distributed to the public, this prasada is also a blessing from the brahmanas or Vaisnavas.
There are four kinds of prasada (catur-vidha). Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of
spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called carvya, cusya, lehya and pehya--prasada that is chewed,
prasada that is licked, prasada tasted with the tongue, and prasada that is drunk. Thus there are many varieties of
prasada, prepared very nicely with grains and ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas and then to the general public. This is the way of human society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land
will not solve the problem of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and being
unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may eat animals, but a perfect human society
advanced in knowledge must learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection of cows.
