TRANSLATION
Drona and Dhara said: Please permit us to be born on the planet earth so that after our appearance, the Supreme
Lord, the Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller and master of all planets, will also appear and spread
devotional service, the ultimate goal of life, so that those born in this material world may very easily be delivered
from the miserable condition of materialistic life by accepting this devotional service.
PURPORT
This statement by Drona clearly indicates that Drona and Dhara are the eternal father and mother of Krsna.
Whenever there is a necessity of Krsna's appearance, Drona and Dhara appear first, and then Krsna appears. Krsna
says in Bhagavad-gita that His birth is not ordinary (janma karma ca me divyam).
ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya
"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all
sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." (Bg. 4.6) Before Krsna's
appearance, Drona and Dhara appear in order to become His father and mother. It is they who appear as Nanda
Maharaja and his wife, Yasoda. In other words, it is not possible for a sadhana-siddha living being to become the
father or mother of Krsna, for Krsna's father and mother are already designated. But by following the principles
exhibited by Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda and their associates, the inhabitants of Vrndavana, ordinary living beings
may attain such affection as exhibited by Nanda and Yasoda.
When Drona and Dhara were requested to beget children, they chose to come to this world to have the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as their son, Krsna. Krsna's appearance means paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca
duskrtam--the devotees are protected, and the miscreants are vanquished. Whenever Krsna comes, He distributes
the highest goal of life, devotional service. He appears as Caitanya Mahaprabhu for the same purpose because
unless one comes to devotional service, one cannot be delivered from the miseries of the material world
(duhkhalayam asasvatam), where the living beings struggle for existence. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Because of conditioned life, they
are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entities are struggling to become
happy, but unless they take to the bhakti cult, their happiness is not possible. Krsna clearly says:
asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa
aprapya mam nivartante
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani
"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to
birth and death in this material world." (Bg. 9.3)
Foolish persons do not know how risky life is here if one does not follow the instructions of Krsna. The Krsna
consciousness movement, therefore, has been started so that by practicing Krsna consciousness one can avoid the
risky life of this material existence. There is no question of accepting or not accepting Krsna consciousness. It is
not optional; it is compulsory. If we do not take to Krsna consciousness, our life is very risky. Everything is
explained in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, to learn how to become free from the miserable condition of material
existence, Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one understands Bhagavad-gita, one can proceed
to Srimad-Bhagavatam, and if one advances further, one may study Caitanya-caritamrta. We are therefore
presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that people may study them and be happy, being delivered
from miserable conditional life.
