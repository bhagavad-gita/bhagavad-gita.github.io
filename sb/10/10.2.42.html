<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; iti--in this way; abhistuya--offering prayers; purusam--unto the
Supreme Personality; yat-rupam--whose form; anidam--transcendental; yatha--as; brahma--Lord Brahma; isanau--
and Lord Siva; purodhaya--keeping them in front; devah--all the demigods; pratiyayuh--returned; divam--to their
heavenly homes.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After thus offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, the Transcendence, all the
demigods, with Lord Brahma and Lord Siva before them, returned to their homes in the heavenly planets.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said:
adyapiha caitanya ei saba lila kare
yan'ra bhagye thake, se dekhaye nirantare
(Caitanya-bhagavata, Madhya 23.513)
The incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear continuously, like the waves of a river or an
ocean. There is no limit to the Lord's incarnations, but they can be perceived only by devotees who are fortunate.
The devatas, the demigods, fortunately understood the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
thus they offered their prayers. Then Lord Siva and Lord Brahma led the demigods in returning to their homes.
The word kuksi-gatah, meaning "within the womb of Devaki," has been discussed by Sri Jiva Gosvami in his
Krama-sandarbha commentary. Since it was said at first that Krsna was present within the heart of Vasudeva and
was transferred to the heart of Devaki, Sri Jiva Gosvami writes, how is it that Krsna was now in the womb? He
replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to
the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.35), andantara-sthaparamanu-
cayantara-stham govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. The Lord can stay wherever He likes.
Devaki, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction
of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devaki-nandana.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"Prayers by the Demigods for Lord Krsna in the Womb."
Chapter Three
The Birth of Lord Krsna
As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, Hari in His original form, appeared as
Visnu so that His father and mother could understand that their son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Because they were afraid of Kamsa, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to Gokula, the
home of Nanda Maharaja.
Mother Devaki, being fully transcendental, sac-cid-ananda, does not belong to this material world. Thus the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in
that Visnu form, Vasudeva was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and Devaki mentally gave
ten thousand cows in charity to the brahmanas. Vasudeva then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the
Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally allpervading.
The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this
material world. When He enters this world as Paramatma, He is all-pervading (andantara-stha-paramanucayantara-
stham), yet He is transcendentally situated. For the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this
material world, the Lord appears as the guna-avataras--Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. Thus Vasudeva offered
prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devaki followed her husband by offering prayers
describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing Kamsa and desiring that the Lord not be understood by
atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and
appear like an ordinary child with two hands.
The Lord reminded Vasudeva and Devaki of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He
had appeared as Prsnigarbha and Vamanadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of
Devaki to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of Vasudeva and Devaki, in the prison
house of Kamsa, and at this very time, Yogamaya took birth as the daughter of Yasoda. By the arrangement of
Yogamaya, Vasudeva was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of Kamsa. When
Vasudeva brought Krsna to the house of Nanda Maharaja, he saw that by Yogamaya's arrangement, Yasoda, as well
as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking Yogamaya from Yasoda's lap and placing
Krsna there instead. Then Vasudeva returned to his own place, having taken Yogamaya as his daughter. He placed
Yogamaya on Devaki's bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In Gokula, Yasoda could not understand
whether she had given birth to a male or a female child.
