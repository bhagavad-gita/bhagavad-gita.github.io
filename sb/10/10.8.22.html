<h2>Text</h2>
tav anghri-yugmam anukrsya sarisrpantau
ghosa-praghosa-ruciram vraja-kardamesu
tan-nada-hrsta-manasav anusrtya lokam
mugdha-prabhitavad upeyatur anti matroh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tau--Krsna and Balarama; anghri-yugmam anukrsya--dragging Their legs; sarisrpantau--crawling like snakes;
ghosa-praghosa-ruciram--producing a sound with Their ankle bells that was very, very sweet to hear; vrajakardamesu--
in the mud created by cow dung and cow urine on the earth of Vrajabhumi; tat-nada--by the sound of
those ankle bells; hrsta-manasau--being very much pleased; anusrtya--following; lokam--other persons; mugdha--
thus being enchanted; prabhita-vat--then again being afraid of them; upeyatuh--immediately returned; anti
matroh--toward Their mothers.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Krsna and Balarama, with the strength of Their legs, crawled in the muddy places created in Vraja by cow
dung and cow urine, Their crawling resembled the crawling of serpents, and the sound of Their ankle bells was
very charming. Very much pleased by the sound of other people's ankle bells, They used to follow these people as if
going to Their mothers, but when They saw that these were other people, They became afraid and returned to
Their real mothers, Yasoda and Rohini.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Krsna and Balarama were crawling about Vrajabhumi, They were enchanted by the sound of ankle bells.
Thus They sometimes followed other people, who would enjoy the crawling of Krsna and Balarama and exclaim,
"Oh, see how Krsna and Balarama are crawling!" Upon hearing this, Krsna and Balarama could understand that
these were not Their mothers They were following, and They would return to Their actual mothers. Thus the
crawling of Krsna and Balarama was enjoyed by the people of the neighborhood, as well as by mother Yasoda and
Rohini and the two children Themselves.
