<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, at the auspicious time for the appearance of the Lord, the entire universe was surcharged with all the
qualities of goodness, beauty and peace. The constellation Rohini appeared, as did stars like Asvini. The sun, the
moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the
beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the
earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and
lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes,
birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure
breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the brahmanas
engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily,
undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to
appear, the saints and brahmanas, who had always been disturbed by demons like Kamsa and his men, felt peace
within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that His appearance, birth, and activities are all transcendental and
that one who factually understands them is immediately eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord's
appearance or birth is not like that of an ordinary man, who is forced to accept a material body according to his
past deeds. The Lord's appearance is explained in the previous chapter: He appears out of His own sweet pleasure.
When the time was mature for the appearance of the Lord, the constellations became very auspicious. The
astrological influence of the constellation known as Rohini was also predominant because this constellation is
considered very auspicious. Rohini is under the direct supervision of Brahma, who is born of Visnu, and it appears
at the birth of Lord Visnu, who in fact is birthless. According to the astrological conclusion, besides the proper
situation of the stars, there are auspicious and inauspicious moments due to the different situations of the different
planetary systems. At the time of Krsna's birth, the planetary systems were automatically adjusted so that
everything became auspicious.
At that time, in all directions, east, west, south, north, everywhere, there was an atmosphere of peace and
prosperity. Auspicious stars were visible in the sky, and on the surface in all towns and villages or pasturing
grounds and within the mind of everyone there were signs of good fortune. The rivers were flowing full of water,
and the lakes were beautifully decorated with lotus flowers. The forests were full with beautiful birds and peacocks.
All the birds within the forests began to sing with sweet voices, and the peacocks began to dance with their
consorts. The wind blew very pleasantly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, and the sensation of bodily touch
was very pleasing. At home, the brahmanas, who were accustomed to offer sacrifices in the fire, found their homes
very pleasant for offerings. Because of disturbances created by the demoniac kings, the sacrificial fire had been
almost stopped in the houses of brahmanas, but now they could find the opportunity to start the fire peacefully.
Being forbidden to offer sacrifices, the brahmanas were very distressed in mind, intelligence and activities. But just
on the point of Krsna's appearance, automatically their minds became full of joy because they could hear loud
vibrations in the sky of transcendental sounds proclaiming the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
On the occasion of Lord Krsna's birth, seasonal changes took place throughout the entire universe. Krsna was
born during the month of September, yet it appeared like springtime. The atmosphere, however, was very cool,
although not chilly, and the rivers and reservoirs appeared just as they would in sarat, the fall. Lotuses and lilies
blossom during the day, but although Krsna appeared at twelve o'clock midnight, the lilies and lotuses were in
bloom, and thus the wind blowing at that time was full of fragrance. Because of Kamsa's disturbances, the Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies had almost stopped. The brahmanas and saintly persons could not execute the Vedic rituals
with peaceful minds. But now the brahmanas were very pleased to perform their daily ritualistic ceremonies
undisturbed. The business of the asuras is to disturb the suras, the devotees and brahmanas, but at the time of
Krsna's appearance these devotees and brahmanas were undisturbed.
