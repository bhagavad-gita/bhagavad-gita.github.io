<h2>Translation</h2>
These two young men, Nalakuvara and Manigriva, are by fortune the sons of the great demigod Kuvera, but
because of false prestige and madness after drinking liquor, they are so fallen that they are naked but cannot
understand that they are. Therefore, because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not conscious),
these two young men should receive the bodies of trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they
become trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have remembrance of their past sinful activities.
Moreover, by my special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the measurement of the demigods, they
will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, face to face, and thus revive their real position
as devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A tree has no consciousness: when cut, it feels no pain. But Narada Muni wanted the consciousness of
Nalakuvara and Manigriva to continue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would not forget
the circumstances under which they had been punished. Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, Narada
Muni arranged things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see Krsna in Vrndavana and
thus revive their dormant bhakti.
Each day of the demigods in the upper planetary system equals six months of our measurement. Although the
demigods in the upper planetary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees, and therefore
they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons, namely the devas and the asuras. Asuras forget their
relationship with Krsna (asuram bhavam asritah), whereas the devas do not forget.
dvau bhuta-sargau loke 'smin
daiva asura eva ca
visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva
asuras tad-viparyayah
(Padma Purana)
The distinction between a pure devotee and a karma-misra devotee is this: a pure devotee does not desire
anything for material enjoyment, whereas a mixed devotee becomes a devotee to become a first-class enjoyer of this
material world. One who is in direct touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains
pure, uncontaminated by material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam).
By karma-misra-bhakti one is elevated to the celestial kingdom, by jnana-misra-bhakti one is able to merge in the
Brahman effulgence, and by yoga-misra-bhakti one is able to realize the omnipotency of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. But pure bhakti does not depend on karma, jnana or yoga, for it simply consists of loving affairs. The
liberation of the bhakta, therefore, which is called not just mukti but vimukti, surpasses the five other kinds of
liberation--sayujya, sarupya, salokya, sarsti and samipya. A pure devotee always engages in pure service
(anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama). Taking birth in the upper planetary system as a demigod is a chance
to become a further purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. Narada Muni indirectly gave Manigriva
and Nalakuvara the greatest opportunity by his so-called curse.
