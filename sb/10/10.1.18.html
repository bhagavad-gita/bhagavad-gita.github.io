<h2>Text</h2>
ya atmano drsya-gunesu sann iti
vyavasyate sva-vyatirekato 'budhah
vinanuvadam na ca tan manisitam
samyag yatas tyaktam upadadat puman
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--anyone who; atmanah--of his own real identity, the soul; drsya-gunesu--among the visible objects,
beginning with the body; san--being situated in that position; iti--thus; vyavasyate--continues to act; svavyatirekatah--
as if the body were independent of the soul; abudhah--a rascal; vina anuvadam--without proper
analytical study; na--not; ca--also; tat--the body and other visible objects; manisitam--such considerations having
been discussed; samyak--fully; yatah--because he is a fool; tyaktam--are rejected; upadadat--accepts this body as
reality; puman--a person.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the
soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his
conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in soul, the visible body and
senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it
a reality.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Without the basic principle of soul, the body cannot be produced. So-called scientists have tried in many ways to
produce a living body in their chemical laboratories, but no one has been able to do it because unless the spirit soul
is present, a body cannot be prepared from material elements. Since scientists are now enamored of theories about
the chemical composition of the body, we have challenged many scientists to make even a small egg. The chemicals
in eggs can be found very easily. There is a white substance and a yellow substance, covered by a shell, and modern
scientists should very easily be able to duplicate all this. But even if they were to prepare such an egg and put it in
an incubator, this man-made chemical egg would not produce a chicken. The soul must be added because there is
no question of a chemical combination for life. Those who think that life can exist without the soul have therefore
been described here as abudhah, foolish rascals.
Again, there are those who reject the body, regarding it as insubstantial. They are of the same category of fools.
One can neither reject the body nor accept it as substantial. The substance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and both the body and the soul are energies of the Supreme Godhead, as described by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My separated
material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine,
which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe."
The body, therefore, has a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the soul does. Since
both of them are energies of the Lord, neither of them is false, because they come from the reality. One who does
not know this secret of life is described as abudhah. According to the Vedic injunctions, aitadatmyam idam sarvam,
sarvam khalv idam brahma: everything is the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, both the body and the soul are
Brahman, since matter and spirit emanate from Brahman.
Not knowing the conclusions of the Vedas, some people accept the material nature as substance, and others
accept the spirit soul as substance, but actually Brahman is the substance. Brahman is the cause of all causes. The
ingredients and the immediate cause of this manifested material world are Brahman, and we cannot make the
ingredients of this world independent of Brahman. Furthermore, since the ingredients and the immediate cause of
this material manifestation are Brahman, both of them are truth, satya; there is no validity to the expression brahma
satyam jagan mithya. The world is not false.
Jnanis reject this world, and foolish persons accept this world as reality, and in this way they are both misguided.
Although the body is not as important as the soul, we cannot say that it is false. Yet the body is temporary, and
only foolish, materialistic persons, who do not have full knowledge of the soul, regard the temporary body as
reality and engage in decorating this body. Both of these pitfalls--rejection of the body as false and acceptance of
the body as all in all--can be avoided when one is fully situated in Krsna consciousness. If we regard this world as
false, we fall into the category of asuras, who say that this world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in
control (asatyam apratistham te jagad ahur anisvaram). As described in the Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita,
this is the conclusion of demons.
