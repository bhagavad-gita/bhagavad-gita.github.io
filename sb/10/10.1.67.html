<h2>Text</h2>
mataram pitaram bhratrn
sarvams ca suhrdas tatha
ghnanti hy asutrpo lubdha
rajanah prayaso bhuvi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mataram--unto the mother; pitaram--unto the father; bhratrn--unto brothers; sarvan ca--and anyone else;
suhrdah--friends; tatha--as well as; ghnanti--they kill (as it is practically seen); hi--indeed; asu-trpah--those who
envy the lives of others for their personal sense gratification; lubdhah--greedy; rajanah--such kings; prayasah--
almost always; bhuvi--on the earth.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kings greedy for sense gratification on this earth almost always kill their enemies indiscriminately. To satisfy
their own whims, they may kill anyone, even their mothers, fathers, brothers or friends.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have seen in the history of India that Aurangzeb killed his brother and nephews and imprisoned his father to
fulfill political ambitions. There have been many similar instances, and Kamsa was the same type of king. Kamsa
did not hesitate to kill his nephews and imprison his sister and his father. For demons to do such things is not
astonishing. Nonetheless, although Kamsa was a demon, he was aware that Lord Visnu cannot be killed, and thus
he attained salvation. Even partial understanding of the activities of Lord Visnu makes one eligible for salvation.
Kamsa knew a little about Krsna--that He could not be killed--and therefore he attained salvation although he
thought of Visnu, Krsna, as an enemy. What then is to be said of one who knows Krsna perfectly from the
descriptions of sastras like Bhagavad-gita? It is therefore the duty of everyone to read Bhagavad-gita and
understand Krsna perfectly. This will make one's life successful.
