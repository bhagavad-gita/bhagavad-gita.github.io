<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--anyone who; etat--this; putana-moksam--salvation of Putana; krsnasya--of Krsna; arbhakam--the childhood
pastimes; adbhutam--wonderful; srnuyat--should hear; sraddhaya--with faith and devotion; martyah--any person

attachment.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Any person who hears with faith and devotion about how Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed
Putana, and who thus invests his hearing in such childhood pastimes of Krsna, certainly attains attachment for
Govinda, the supreme, original person.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but was killed herself is certainly wonderful.
Therefore this verse uses the word adbhutam, meaning "specifically wonderful." Krsna has left us many wonderful
narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in Krsna, the Supreme personality
of Godhead, one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for
Govinda, Adi-purusa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Killing of the Demon Putana."
Chapter Seven
The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta
In this chapter, Sri Krsna's pastimes of breaking the cart (sakata-bhanjana), killing the asura known as Trnavarta,
and demonstrating the entire universe within His mouth are especially described.
When Sukadeva Gosvami saw that Maharaja Pariksit was eagerly waiting to hear about Lord Krsna's pastimes as a
child, he was very much pleased, and he continued to speak. When Sri Krsna was only three months old and was
just trying to turn backside up, before He even attempted to crawl, mother Yasoda wanted to observe a ritualistic
ceremony with her friends for the good fortune of the child. Such a ritualistic ceremony is generally performed
with ladies who also have small children. When mother Yasoda saw that Krsna was falling asleep, because of other
engagements she put the child underneath a household cart, called sakata, and while the child was sleeping, she
engaged herself in other business pertaining to the auspicious ritualistic ceremony. Underneath the cart was a
cradle, and mother Yasoda placed the child in that cradle. The child was sleeping, but suddenly He awakened and,
as usual for a child, began to kick His small legs. This kicking shook the cart, which collapsed with a great sound,
breaking completely and spilling all its contents. Children who were playing nearby immediately informed mother
Yasoda that the cart had broken, and therefore she hastily arrived there in great anxiety with the other gopis.
Mother Yasoda immediately took the child on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast. Then various types of
Vedic ritualistic ceremonies were performed with the help of the brahmanas. Not knowing the real identity of the
child, the brahmanas showered the child with blessings.
Another day, when mother Yasoda was sitting with her child on her lap, she suddenly observed that he had
assumed the weight of the entire universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and in the
meantime Trnavarta, one of the servants of Kamsa, appeared there as a whirlwind and took the child away. The
whole tract of land known as Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child had been
taken, and all the gopis were overwhelmed because He had been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky,
the asura, being overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although he also could not drop the
child because the child had caught him so tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body.
Thus Trnavarta himself fell down from a very great height, the child grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and
immediately died. The demon having fallen, the gopis picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap of mother
Yasoda. Thus mother Yasoda was struck with wonder, but because of yogamaya's influence, no one could
understand who Krsna was and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise fortune for the
child's having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda Maharaja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful
foretelling of Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great yogi. Later, when the child was on the lap of mother
Yasoda, the child yawned, and mother Yasoda could see within His mouth the entire universal manifestation.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pariksit said: My lord, Sukadeva Gosvami, all the various activities exhibited by the incarnations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead are certainly pleasing to the ear and to the mind. Simply by one's hearing of these
activities, the dirty things in one's mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear about the activities
of the Lord, but Krsna's childhood activities are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind and
ear. Thus one's attachment for hearing about material things, which is the root cause of material existence,
vanishes, and one gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attachment for Him, and friendship
with devotees who give us the contribution of Krsna consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak about those
activities of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the prema-vivarta:
krsna-bahirmukha haiya bhoga-vancha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
Our material existence is maya, or illusion, in which we desire different varieties of material enjoyment and
therefore change to different varieties of bodies (bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya). Asann api
klesada asa dehah: as long as we have these temporary bodies, they give us many varieties of tribulation--
adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika. This is the root cause of all suffering, but this root cause of suffering
can be removed by revival of our Krsna consciousness. All the Vedic literatures presented by Vyasadeva and other
great sages are therefore intended to revive our Krsna consciousness, which begins to revive with sravana-kirtanam.
Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah (Bhag. 1.2.17). Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us
a chance to hear about Krsna. Krsna has different avataras, or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which
arouse one's inquisitiveness, but generally such avataras as Matsya, Kurma and Varaha are not as attractive as
Krsna. First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about Krsna, and this is the root cause of our
suffering.
But Pariksit Maharaja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby Krsna, which amazed mother
Yasoda and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood,
Krsna killed Putana, Trnavarta and Sakatasura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the
pastimes of Krsna, one after another, kept mother Yasoda and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment.
The process to revive one's Krsna consciousness is adau sraddha tatah sadhu-sangah (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
1.4.15). The pastimes of Krsna can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of Krsna
consciousness by hearing from Vaisnavas about the activities of Krsna, one becomes attached to Vaisnavas who are
interested only in Krsna consciousness. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja recommends that one hear about Krsna's
childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, Kurma and
Varaha. Wanting to hear more and more from Sukadeva Gosvami, Maharaja Pariksit requested him to continue
describing Krsna's childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more
inquisitiveness.
