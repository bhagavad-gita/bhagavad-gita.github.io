<h2>Text</h2>
pathi pragrahinam kamsam
abhasyahasarira-vak
asyas tvam astamo garbho
hanta yam vahase 'budha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pathi--on the way; pragrahinam--who was managing the reins of the horses; kamsam--unto Kamsa; abhasya--
addressing; aha--said; a-sarira-vak--a voice coming from someone whose body was invisible; asyah--of this girl
(Devaki); tvam--you; astamah--the eighth; garbhah--pregnancy; hanta--killer; yam--her whom; vahase--you are
carrying; abudha--you foolish rascal.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Kamsa, controlling the reins of the horses, was driving the chariot along the way, an unembodied voice
addressed him, "You foolish rascal, the eighth child of the woman you are carrying will kill you!"
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The omen spoke of astamo garbhah, referring to the eighth pregnancy, but did not clearly say whether the child
was to be a son or a daughter. Even if Kamsa were to see that the eighth child of Devaki was a daughter, he should
have no doubt that the eighth child was to kill him. According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word garbha means
"embryo" and also arbhaka, or "child." Kamsa was affectionate toward his sister, and therefore he had become the
chariot driver to carry her and his brother-in-law to their home. The demigods, however, did not want Kamsa to be
affectionate toward Devaki, and therefore, from an unseen position, they encouraged Kamsa to offend her.
Moreover, the six sons of Marici had been cursed to take birth from the womb of Devaki, and upon being killed by
Kamsa they would be delivered. When Devaki understood that Kamsa would be killed by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who would appear from her womb, she felt great joy. The word vahase is also significant because it
indicates that the ominous vibration condemned Kamsa for acting just like a beast of burden by carrying his
enemy's mother.
