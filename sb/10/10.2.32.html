<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: After Vasudeva advised Nanda Maharaja in this way, Nanda Maharaja and his associates,
the cowherd men, took permission from Vasudeva, yoked their bulls to the bullock carts, and started riding for
Gokula.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Tenth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Meeting of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva."
Chapter Six
The Killing of the Demon Putana
A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when Nanda Maharaja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was
returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death.
While Nanda Maharaja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva's words concerning disturbances in
Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Meanwhile, Kamsa sent to the village
of Gokula a Raksasi named Putana, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever
there is no Krsna consciousness, there is the danger of such Raksasis, but since the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Putana could accept nothing there but her own death.
One day, Putana arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of Nanda Maharaja, and by displaying her mystic
power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered Krsna's
bedroom without anyone's permission; by the grace of Krsna, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room,
because that was Krsna's desire. The baby Krsna, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Putana and
thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of yogamaya and
the Personality of Godhead, Putana took Krsna upon her lap, and neither Rohini nor Yasoda objected. The demon
Putana offered her breast for Krsna to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child Krsna, therefore,
squeezed Putana's breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the
ground. Then Krsna began playing on her breast just like a small child. When Krsna was playing, the gopis were
pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the gopis took precautions because of the
attack of the Raksasi. Mother Yasoda gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed.
Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from Mathura, and when they saw the great
dead body of Putana, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold this
mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of
Putana into pieces, but because Krsna had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when
the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance.
Ultimately, although Putana had desired to kill Krsna, she attained the Lord's abode. From this incident we gain
the instruction that if one is attached to Krsna somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success.
What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to Krsna in love? When the inhabitants of Vraja
heard about the killing of Putana and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda Maharaja took
the baby Krsna on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.
