<h2>Translation</h2>
At the time of death, according to the thinking, feeling and willing of the mind, which is involved in fruitive
activities, one receives a particular body. In other words, the body develops according to the activities of the mind.
Changes of body are due to the flickering of the mind, for otherwise the soul could remain in its original, spiritual
body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One can very easily understand that the mind is constantly flickering, changing in the quality of its thinking,
feeling and willing. This is explained by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (6.34):
cancalam hi manah krsna
pramathi balavad drdham
tasyaham nigraham manye
vayor iva suduskaram
The mind is cancala, flickering, and it changes very strongly. Therefore Arjuna admitted that controlling the
mind is not at all possible; this would be as difficult as controlling the wind. For example, if one were in a boat
moving according to the wind on a river or the sea, and the wind were uncontrollable, the tilting boat would be
very much disturbed and extremely difficult to control. It might even capsize. Therefore, in the bhava-samudra, the
ocean of mental speculation and transmigration to different types of bodies, one must first control the mind.
By regulative practice one can control the mind, and this is the purpose of the yoga system (abhyasa-yogayuktena).
But there is a chance of failure with the yoga system, especially in this age of Kali, because the yoga
system uses artificial means. If the mind is engaged in bhakti-yoga, however, by the grace of Krsna one can very
easily control it. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva
kevalam. One should chant the holy name of the Lord constantly, for the holy name of the Lord is nondifferent
from Hari, the Supreme Person.
By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra constantly, one can fix the mind on the lotus feet of Krsna (sa vai manah
krsna-padaravindayoh) and in this way achieve the perfection of yoga. Otherwise, the flickering mind will hover on
the platform of mental speculation for sense enjoyment, and one will have to transmigrate from one type of body to
another because the mind is trained only in relation to the material elements, or, in other words, to sense
gratification, which is false. Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag. 7.9.43). Rascals (vimudhan), being
controlled by mental speculation, make huge arrangements by which to enjoy life temporarily, but they must give
up the body at the time of death, when everything is taken away by Krsna's external energy (mrtyuh sarva-haras
caham). At that time, whatever one has created in this life is lost, and one must automatically accept a new body by
the force of material nature. In this life one may have constructed a very tall skyscraper, but in the next life,
because of one's mentality, one may have to accept a body like that of a cat, a dog, a tree or perhaps a demigod.
Thus the body is offered by the laws of material nature. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg.
13.22). The spirit soul takes birth in higher and lower species of life only because of his association with the three
qualities of material nature.
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion
live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds." (Bg. 14.18)
In conclusion, the Krsna consciousness movement offers the topmost welfare activity for human society. The
saner section of human society must therefore take this movement very seriously for the benefit of all humanity. To
save oneself from the repetition of birth and death, one must purify his consciousness. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must be freed from all designations--"I am American," "I am Indian," "I am this," "I
am that"--and come to the platform of understanding that Krsna is the original master and we are His eternal
servants. When the senses are purified and engaged in Krsna's service, one achieves the highest perfection.
Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. The Krsna consciousness movement is a movement of bhakti-yoga.
Vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga. By following the principles of this movement, one becomes disassociated from
material mental concoctions and is established on the original platform of the eternal relationship between the
living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead as servant and master. This, in summary, is the purpose of
the Krsna consciousness movement.
