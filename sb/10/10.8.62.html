<h2>Translation</h2>
After seeing this, Lord Brahma hastily got down from his swan carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched
the lotus feet of Lord Krsna with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering his obeisances, he bathed the
feet of Krsna with the water of his tears of joy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma bowed down like a stick, and because Lord Brahma's complexion is golden, he appeared to be like a
golden stick lying down before Lord Krsna. When one falls down before a superior just like a stick, one's offering
of obeisances is called dandavat. Danda means "stick," and vat means "like." It is not that one should simply say,
"dandavat." Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahma fell down, touching his foreheads to the lotus feet of Krsna,
and his crying in ecstasy is to be regarded as an abhiseka bathing ceremony of Krsna's lotus feet.
He who appeared before Brahma as a human child was in fact the Absolute Truth, Parabrahman (brahmeti
paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate). The Supreme Lord is narakrti; that is, He resembles a human being. It is not
that He is four-armed (catur-bahu). Narayana is catur-bahu, but the Supreme Person resembles a human being.
This is also confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image of God.
Lord Brahma saw that Krsna, in His form as a cowherd boy, was Parabrahman, the root cause of everything, but
was now appearing as a human child, loitering in Vrndavana with a morsel of food in His hand. Astonished, Lord
Brahma hastily got down from his swan carrier and let his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch
the ground, but Lord Brahma, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed down on the ground before
Krsna. Although Brahma has one head in each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and
touched Krsna's feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his intelligence works in every direction, he
surrendered everything before the boy Krsna.
It is mentioned that Brahma washed the feet of Krsna with his tears, and here the word sujalaih indicates that his
tears were purified. As soon as bhakti is present, everything is purified (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam). Therefore
Brahma's crying was a form of bhakty-anubhava, a transformation of transcendental ecstatic love.
