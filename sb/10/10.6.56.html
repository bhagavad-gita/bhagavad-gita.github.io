<h2>Text</h2>
athapy abhibhavanty enam
naiva te ghora-darsanah
jighamsayainam asadya
nasyanty agnau patangavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha api--although they come to attack; abhibhavanti--they are able to kill; enam--this boy; na--not; eva--
certainly; te--all of them; ghora-darsanah--very fierce looking; jighamsaya--because of envy; enam--unto Krsna;
asadya--approaching; nasyanti--are vanquished (death occurs to the aggressor); agnau--in fire; patanga-vat--like
flies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the causes of death, the daityas, were very fierce, they could not kill this boy Krsna. Rather, because
they came to kill innocent boys, as soon as they approached they themselves were killed, exactly like flies attacking
a fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja innocently thought, "Perhaps this boy Krsna formerly killed all these demons, and therefore in
this life they are envious and are attacking Him. But Krsna is a fire, and they are flies, and in a fight between fire
and flies, the fire is always victorious." Fighting is always taking place between the demons and the power of the
Supreme Personality. Paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg. 4.8). Anyone who is against the control of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be killed, life after life. Ordinary living beings are subject to karma, but
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always victorious over the demons.
