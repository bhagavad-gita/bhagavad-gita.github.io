<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the bestower of many benedictions, including liberation
[kaivalya], or oneness with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the gopis always felt maternal
love, and Krsna sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and
son, although the gopis were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this
material world after leaving their bodies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The advantage of Krsna consciousness is described herein. Krsna consciousness gradually develops on the
transcendental platform. One may think of Krsna as the supreme personality, one may think of Krsna as the
supreme master, one may think of Krsna as the supreme friend, one may think of Krsna as the supreme son, or one
may think of Krsna as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with Krsna in any of these transcendental
relationships, the course of one's material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(4.9), tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is
guaranteed. Na punah kalpate rajan samsaro jnana-sambhavah. This verse also guarantees that devotees who
constantly think of Krsna in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world
of samsara, there are the same relationships. One thinks, "Here is my son," "Here is my wife," "Here is my lover,"
or "Here is my friend." But these relationships are temporary illusions. Ajnana-sambhavah: such a consciousness
awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in Krsna consciousness, one's spiritual life is
revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the gopis who were friends of
Rohini and mother Yasoda and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by Krsna were not directly Krsna's mothers,
they all had the same chance as Rohini and Yasoda to go back to Godhead and act as Krsna's mothers-in-law,
servants and so on. The word samsara refers to attachment for one's body, home, husband or wife, and children,
but although the gopis and all the other inhabitants of Vrndavana had the same affection and attachment for
husband and home, their central affection was for Krsna in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they
were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka Vrndavana in the next life, to live with Krsna eternally in spiritual
happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back
home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda Thakura: krsnera samsara kara chadi' anacara. One
should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of Krsna. Then one's liberation is guaranteed.
