<h2>Text</h2>
sa devaki sarva-jagan-nivasanivasa-
bhuta nitaram na reje
bhojendra-gehe 'gni-sikheva ruddha
sarasvati jnana-khale yatha sati
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa devaki--that Devakidevi; sarva-jagat-nivasa--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sustainer of all the
universes (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani); nivasa-bhuta--the womb of Devaki has now become the residence; nitaram--
extensively; na--not; reje--became illuminated; bhojendra-gehe--within the limits of the house of Kamsa; agni-sikha
iva--like the flames of a fire; ruddha--covered; sarasvati--knowledge; jnana-khale--in a person known as jnanakhala,
one who possesses knowledge but cannot distribute it; yatha--or just as; sati--so being.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Devaki then kept within herself the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the foundation of
the entire cosmos, but because she was under arrest in the house of Kamsa, she was like the flames of a fire covered
by the walls of a pot, or like a person who has knowledge but cannot distribute it to the world for the benefit of
human society.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word jnana-khala is most significant. Knowledge is meant for distribution. Although there is
already much scientific knowledge, whenever scientists or philosophers awaken to a particular type of knowledge,
they try to distribute it throughout the world, for otherwise the knowledge gradually dries up and no one benefits
from it. India has the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, but unfortunately, for some reason or other, this sublime
knowledge of the science of God was not distributed throughout the world, although it is meant for all of human
society. Therefore Krsna Himself appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and ordered all Indians to take up the cause
of distributing the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita throughout the entire world.
yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa
amara ajnaya guru hana tara' ei desa
"Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Sri Krsna as they are given in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land." (Cc. Madhya 7.128)
Although India has the sublime knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, Indians have not done their proper duty of
distributing it. Now, therefore, the Krsna consciousness movement has been set up to distribute this knowledge as
it is, without distortion. Although previously there were attempts to distribute the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita,
these attempts involved distortion and compromise with mundane knowledge. But now the Krsna consciousness
movement, without mundane compromises, is distributing Bhagavad-gita as it is, and people are deriving the
benefits of awakening to Krsna consciousness and becoming devotees of Lord Krsna. Therefore the proper
distribution of knowledge has begun by which not only will the whole world benefit, but India's glory will be
magnified in human society. Kamsa tried to arrest Krsna consciousness within his house (bhojendra-gehe), with
the result that Kamsa, with all his opulences, was later vanquished. Similarly, the real knowledge of Bhagavad-gita
was being choked by unscrupulous Indian leaders, with the result that India's culture, and knowledge of the
Supreme were being lost. Now, however, because Krsna consciousness is spreading, the proper use of Bhagavadgita
is being attempted.
