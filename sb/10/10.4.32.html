<h2>Text</h2>
ekada kridamanas te
ramadya gopa-darakah
krsno mrdam bhaksitavan
iti matre nyavedayan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekada--once upon a time; kridamanah--now Krsna, being still more grown up, was playing with other children of
the same age; te--they; rama-adyah--Balarama and others; gopa-darakah--other boys born in the same
neighborhood of the cowherd men; krsnah mrdam bhaksitavan--O Mother, Krsna has eaten earth (a complaint was
lodged); iti--thus; matre--unto mother Yasoda; nyavedayan--they submitted.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One day while Krsna was playing with His small playmates, including Balarama and other sons of the gopas, all
His friends came together and lodged a complaint to mother Yasoda. "Mother," they submitted, "Krsna has eaten
earth."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is another of Krsna's transcendental activities invented to please the gopis. First a complaint was lodged
with mother Yasoda about Krsna's stealing, but mother Yasoda did not chastise Him. Now, in an attempt to awaken
mother Yasoda's anger so that she would chastise Krsna, another complaint was invented--that Krsna had eaten
earth.
