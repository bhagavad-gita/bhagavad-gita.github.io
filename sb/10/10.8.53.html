<h2>Text</h2>
kala-svabhava-samskarakama-

sva-mahi-dhvasta-mahibhir
murtimadbhir upasitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kala--by the time factor; svabhava--own nature; samskara--reformation; kama--desire; karma--fruitive action;
guna--the three modes of material nature; adibhih--and by others; sva-mahi-dhvasta-mahibhih--whose own
independence was subordinate to the potency of the Lord; murti-madbhih--possessing form; upasitah--were being
worshiped.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Then Lord Brahma saw that kala (the time factor), svabhava (one's own nature by association), samskara
(reformation), kama (desire), karma (fruitive activity) and the gunas (the three modes of material nature), their
own independence being completely subordinate to the potency of the Lord, had all taken forms and were also
worshiping those visnu-murtis.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
No one but Visnu has any independence. If we develop consciousness of this fact, then we are in actual Krsna
consciousness. We should always remember that Krsna is the only supreme master and that everyone else is His
servant (ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya). Be one even Narayana or Lord Siva, everyone is subordinate to Krsna
(siva-virincinutam). Even Baladeva is subordinate to Krsna. This is a fact.
ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
(Cc. Adi 5.142>
One should understand that no one is independent, for everything is part and parcel of Krsna and is acting and
moving by the supreme desire of Krsna. This understanding, this consciousness, is Krsna consciousness.
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
"A person who considers demigods like Brahma and Siva to be on an equal level with Narayana must certainly be
considered an offender." No one can compare to Narayana, or Krsna. Krsna is Narayana, and Narayana is also
Krsna, for Krsna is the original Narayana. Brahma himself addressed Krsna, narayanas tvam na hi sarva-dehinam:
"You are also Narayana. Indeed, You are the original Narayana." (Bhag. 10.14.14)
Kala, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabhava, samskara, kama, karma and guna. Svabhava, or
one's own nature, is formed according to the association of the material qualities. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sadasad-
yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Sat and asat-svabhava--one's higher or lower nature--is formed by association with
the different qualities, namely sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. We should gradually come to the sattvaguna,
so that we may avoid the two lower gunas. This can be done if we regularly discuss Srimad-Bhagavatam and
hear about Krsna's activities. Nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya (Bhag. 1.2.18). All the activities of
Krsna described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, beginning even with the pastimes concerning Putana, are transcendental.
Therefore, by hearing and discussing Srimad-Bhagavatam, the rajo-guna and tamo-guna are subdued, so that only
sattva-guna remains. Then rajo-guna and tamo-guna cannot do us any harm.
Varnasrama-dharma, therefore, is essential, for it can bring people to sattva-guna. Tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kamalobhadayas
ca ye (Bhag. 1.2.19). Tamo-guna and rajo-guna increase lust and greed, which implicate a living entity
in such a way that he must exist in this material world in many, many forms. That is very dangerous. One should
therefore be brought to sattva-guna by the establishment of varnasrama-dharma and should develop the
brahminical qualifications of being very neat and clean, rising early in the morning and seeing mangala-aratrika,
and so on. In this way, one should stay in sattva-guna, and then one cannot be influenced by tamo-guna and rajoguna.
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitam sattve prasidati
(Bhag. 1.2.19)
The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life; in other lives, this is not possible. Such
purification can be achieved very easily by radha-krsna-bhajana, devotional service rendered to Radha and Krsna,
and therefore Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu, indicating that unless one worships
Radha-Krsna, one's human form of life is wasted. Vasudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah. janayaty asu
vairagyam (Bhag. 1.2.7). By engagement in the service of Vasudeva, one very quickly renounces material life. The
members of the Krsna consciousness movement, for example, being engaged in vasudeva-bhakti, very quickly
come to the stage of being nice Vaisnavas, so much so that people are surprised that mlecchas and yavanas are able
to come to this stage. This is possible by vasudeva-bhakti. But if we do not come to the stage of sattva-guna in this
human life, then, as Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu--there is no profit in gaining
this human form of life.
Sri Viraraghava Acarya comments that each of the items mentioned in the first half of this verse is a cause for
material entanglement. Kala, or the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and svabhava is the result of
association with these modes. Therefore Narottama dasa Thakura says, bhakta-sane vasa. If one associates with
bhaktas, then one's svabhava, or nature, will change. Our Krsna consciousness movement is meant to give people
good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the
world are gradually becoming devotees.
As for samskara, or reformation, this is possible by good association, for by good association one develops good
habits, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, bhakta-sane vasa: let people have the chance to live with
bhaktas. Then their habits will change. In the human form of life one has this chance, but as Narottama dasa
Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu: if one fails to take advantage of this opportunity, one's human life
is wasted. We are therefore trying to save human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher
nature.
As for kama and karma--desires and activities--if one engages in devotional service, one develops a different
nature than if one engages in activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different. According to
the association of different natures, one receives a particular type of body. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni
janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life
will be successful. A man is known by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of
devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one's character or nature will change for one's eternal
benefit.
