<h2>Text</h2>
tvam asya lokasya vibho riraksisur
grhe 'vatirno 'si mamakhilesvara
rajanya-samjnasura-koti-yuthapair
nirvyuhyamana nihanisyase camuh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvam--Your Lordship; asya--of this world; lokasya--especially of this martya-loka, the planet earth; vibho--O
Supreme; riraksisuh--desiring protection (from the disturbance of the asuras); grhe--in this house; avatirnah asi--
have now appeared; mama--my; akhila-isvara--although You are the proprietor of the entire creation; rajanyasamjna-
asura-koti-yutha-paih--with millions of demons and their followers in the roles of politicians and kings;
nirvyuhyamanah--which are moving here and there all over the world; nihanisyase--will kill; camuh--the armies,
paraphernalia, soldiers and retinues.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, proprietor of all creation, You have now appeared in my house, desiring to protect this world. I am
sure that You will kill all the armies that are moving all over the world under the leadership of politicians who are
dressed as ksatriya rulers but who are factually demons. They must be killed by You for the protection of the
innocent public.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna appears in this world for two purposes, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: to protect the
innocent, religious devotees of the Lord and to annihilate all the uneducated, uncultured asuras, who unnecessarily
bark like dogs and fight among themselves for political power. It is said, kali-kale nama-rupe krsna avatara. The
Hare Krsna movement is also an incarnation of Krsna in the form of the holy name (nama-rupe). Every one of us
who is actually afraid of the asuric rulers and politicians must welcome this incarnation of Krsna: Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then we will surely be protected
from the harassment of asuric rulers. At the present moment these rulers are so powerful that by hook or by crook
they capture the highest posts in government and harass countless numbers of people on the plea of national
security or some emergency. Then again, one asura defeats another asura, but the public continues to suffer.
Therefore the entire world is in a precarious condition, and the only hope is this Hare Krsna movement. Lord
Nrsimhadeva appeared when Prahlada was excessively harassed by his asuric father. Because of such asuric
fathers--that is, the ruling politicians--it is very difficult to press forward the Hare Krsna movement, but because
Krsna has now appeared in His holy name through this movement, we can hope that these asuric fathers will be
annihilated and the kingdom of God established all over the world. The entire world is now full of many asuras in
the guise of politicians, gurus, sadhus, yogis and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away
from Krsna consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society.
