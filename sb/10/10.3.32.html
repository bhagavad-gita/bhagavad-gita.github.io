<h2>Translation</h2>
Nanda Maharaja and the others said: We must previously have performed austerities for a very long time,
worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed pious activities for public life, constructing public
roads and wells, and also given charity, as a result of which this boy, although faced with death, has returned to
give happiness to His relatives.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja confirmed that by pious activities one can become a sadhu so that one will be happy at home
and one's children will be protected. In sastra there are many injunctions for karmis and jnanis, especially for
karmis, by which they can become pious and happy even in material life. According to Vedic civilization, one
should perform activities for the benefit of the public, such as constructing public roads, planting trees on both
sides of the road so that people can walk in the shade, and constructing public wells so that everyone can take
water without difficulty. One should perform austerity to control one's desires, and one must simultaneously
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one becomes pious, and as a result one is happy even in
material conditions of life.
