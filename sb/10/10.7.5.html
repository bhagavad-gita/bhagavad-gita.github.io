<h2>Text</h2>
musnanto 'nyonya-sikyadin
jnatan arac ca ciksipuh
tatratyas ca punar durad
dhasantas ca punar daduh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
musnantah--stealing; anyonya--from one another; sikya-adin--lunch bags and other belongings; jnatan--having
been understood by the proprietor of the bag; arat ca--to a distant place; ciksipuh--threw away; tatratyah ca--those
who were in that place also; punah durat--then again threw farther away; hasantah ca punah daduh--when they saw
the proprietor, they threw it farther away and enjoyed laughing, and when the owner sometimes cried, his bag was
given to him again.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All the cowherd boys used to steal one another's lunch bags. When a boy came to understand that his bag had
been taken away, the other boys would throw it farther away, to a more distant place, and those standing there
would throw it still farther. When the proprietor of the bag became disappointed, the other boys would laugh, the
proprietor would cry, and then the bag would be returned.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This kind of playing and stealing among boys still exists even in the material world because this kind of sporting
pleasure is present in the spiritual world, from which this idea of enjoyment emanates. Janmady asya yatah
(Vedanta-sutra 1.1.2). This same enjoyment is displayed by Krsna and His associates in the spiritual world, but
there the enjoyment is eternal, whereas here, on the material platform, it is temporary; there the enjoyment is
brahman, whereas here the enjoyment is jada. The Krsna consciousness movement is meant to train one how to
transfer oneself from the jada to the Brahman, because human life is meant for this purpose. Athato brahma jijnasa
(Vedanta-sutra 1.1.1). Krsna comes down to teach us how we can enjoy with Him on the spiritual platform, in the
spiritual world. Not only does He come, but He personally displays His pastimes in Vrndavana and attracts people
to spiritual enjoyment.
