bugles by the cowherd boys; tvara--immediately; utthitah--awakened from their respective household duties;
utthapya--immediately lifted their respective sons; dorbhih--with their two arms; parirabhya--embracing;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The mothers of the boys, upon hearing the sounds of the flutes and bugles being played by their sons,
immediately rose from their household tasks, lifted their boys onto their laps, embraced them with both arms and
began to feed them with their breast milk, which flowed forth because of extreme love specifically for Krsna.
Actually Krsna is everything, but at that time, expressing extreme love and affection, they took special pleasure in
feeding Krsna, the Parabrahman, and Krsna drank the milk from His respective mothers as if it were a nectarean
beverage.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although all the elderly gopis knew that Krsna was the son of mother Yasoda, they still desired, "If Krsna had
become my son, I would also have taken care of Him like mother Yasoda. "This was their inner ambition. Now, in
order to please them, Krsna personally took the role of their sons and fulfilled their desire. They enhanced their
special love for Krsna by embracing Him and feeding Him, and Krsna tasted their breast milk to be just like a
nectarean beverage. While thus bewildering Brahma, He enjoyed the special transcendental pleasure created by
yogamaya between all the other mothers and Himself.
