<h2>Text</h2>
bibhrad venum jathara-patayoh srnga-vetre ca kakse
vame panau masrna-kavalam tat-phalany angulisu
tisthan madhye sva-parisuhrdo hasayan narmabhih svaih
svarge loke misati bubhuje yajna-bhug bala-kelih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bibhrat venum--keeping the flute; jathara-patayoh--between the tight clothing and the abdomen; srnga-vetre--
both the horn bugle and the cow-driving stick; ca--also; kakse--on the waist; vame--on the left-hand side; panau--
taking in hand; masrna-kavalam--very nice food prepared with rice and first-class curd; tat-phalani--suitable pieces
of fruit like bael; angulisu--between the fingers; tisthan--staying in this way; madhye--in the middle; sva-parisuhrdah--
His own personal associates; hasayan--making them laugh; narmabhih--with joking words; svaih--His
own; svarge loke misati--while the inhabitants of the heavenly planets, Svargaloka, were watching this wonderful
scene; bubhuje--Krsna enjoyed; yajna-bhuk bala-kelih--although He accepts offerings in yajna, for the sake of
childhood pastimes He was enjoying foodstuffs very jubilantly with His cowherd boyfriends.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Krsna is yajna-bhuk--that is, He eats only offerings of yajna--but to exhibit His childhood pastimes, He now sat
with His flute tucked between His waist and His tight cloth on His right side and with His horn bugle and cowdriving
stick on His left. Holding in His hand a very nice preparation of yogurt and rice, with pieces of suitable
fruit between His fingers, He sat like the whorl of a lotus flower, looking forward toward all His friends, personally
joking with them and creating jubilant laughter among them as He ate. At that time, the denizens of heaven were
watching, struck with wonder at how the Personality of Godhead, who eats only in yajna, was now eating with His
friends in the forest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Krsna was eating with His cowherd boyfriends, a certain bumblebee came there to take part in the eating.
Thus Krsna joked, "Why have you come to disturb My brahmana friend Madhumangala? You want to kill a
brahmana. This is not good." All the boys would laugh and enjoy, speaking such joking words while eating. Thus
the inhabitants of the higher planets were astonished at how the Supreme personality of Godhead, who eats only
when yajna is offered, was now eating like an ordinary child with His friends in the forest.
