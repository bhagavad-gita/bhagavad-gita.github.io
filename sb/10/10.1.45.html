<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/10/10.1.45.html">10.1.45</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
yuvam mam putra-bhavena
brahma-bhavena casakrt
cintayantau krta-snehau
yasyethe mad-gatim param
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yuvam--both of you (husband and wife); mam--unto Me; putra-bhavena--as your son; brahma-bhavena--knowing
that I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ca--and; asakrt--constantly; cintayantau--thinking like that; krtasnehau--
dealing with love and affection; yasyethe--shall both obtain; mat-gatim--My supreme abode; param--which
is transcendental, beyond this material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Both of you, husband and wife, constantly think of Me as your son, but always know that I am the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. By thus thinking of Me constantly with love and affection, you will achieve the highest
perfection: returning home, back to Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This instruction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His father and mother, who are eternally connected
with Him, is especially intended for persons eager to return home, back to Godhead. One should never think of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as an ordinary human being, as nondevotees do. Krsna, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, personally appeared and left His instructions for the benefit of all human society, but fools and rascals
unfortunately think of Him as an ordinary human being and twist the instructions of Bhagavad-gita for the
satisfaction of their senses. Practically everyone commenting on Bhagavad-gita interprets it for sense gratification.
It has become especially fashionable for modern scholars and politicians to interpret Bhagavad-gita as if it were
something fictitious, and by their wrong interpretations they are spoiling their own careers and the careers of
others. The Krsna consciousness movement, however, is fighting against this principle of regarding Krsna as a
fictitious person and of accepting that there was no Battle of Kuruksetra, that everything is symbolic, and that
nothing in Bhagavad-gita is true. In any case, if one truly wants to be successful, one can do so by reading the text
of Bhagavad-gita as it is. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu especially stressed the instructions of Bhagavad-gita: yare dekha,
tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa. If one wants to achieve the highest success in life, one must accept Bhagavad-gita as
spoken by the Supreme Lord. By accepting Bhagavad-gita in this way, all of human society can become perfect and
happy.
It is to be noted that because Vasudeva and Devaki would be separated from Krsna when He was carried to
Gokula, the residence of Nanda Maharaja, the Lord personally instructed them that they should always think of
Him as their son and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That would keep them in touch with Him. After
eleven years, the Lord would return to Mathura to be their son, and therefore there was no question of separation.
