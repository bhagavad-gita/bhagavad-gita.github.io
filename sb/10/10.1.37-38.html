<h2>Translation</h2>
O sinless mother Devaki, after the expiry of twelve thousand celestial years, in which you constantly
contemplated Me within the core of your heart with great faith, devotion and austerity, I was very much satisfied
with you. Since I am the best of all bestowers of benediction, I appeared in this same form as Krsna to ask you to
take from Me the benediction you desired. You then expressed your desire to have a son exactly like Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Twelve thousand years on the celestial planets is not a very long time for those who live in the upper planetary
system, although it may be very long for those who live on this planet. Sutapa was the son of Brahma, and as we
have already understood from Bhagavad-gita (8.17), one day of Brahma equals many millions of years according to
our calculation (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh). We should be careful to understand that to
get Krsna as one's son, one must undergo such great austerities. If we want to get the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to
Krsna (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through
love only, we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore declared, prema
pum-artho mahan: love of Godhead is the highest achievement for anyone.
As we have explained, in worship of the Lord there are three stages--jnana, jnanamayi and rati, or love. Sutapa
and his wife, Prsni, inaugurated their devotional activities on the basis of full knowledge. Gradually they developed
love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when this love was mature, the Lord appeared as Visnu,
although Devaki then requested Him to assume the form of Krsna. To love the Supreme Personality of Godhead
more, we want a form of the Lord like Krsna or Rama. We can engage in loving transactions with Krsna especially.
In this age, we are all fallen, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
bestow upon us love of Godhead directly. This was appreciated by the associates of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Rupa
Gosvami said:
namo maha-vadanyaya
krsna-prema-pradaya te
krsnaya krsna-caitanyanamne
gaura-tvise namah
In this verse, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is described as maha-vadanya, the most munificent of charitable persons,
because He gives Krsna so easily that one can attain Krsna simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. We
should therefore take advantage of the benediction given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and when by chanting the
Hare Krsna mantra we are cleansed of all dirty things (ceto-darpana-marjanam), we shall be able to understand
very easily that Krsna is the only object of love (kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet).
Therefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years; one need only learn how to love
Krsna and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah). Then one can
very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a
son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we
eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, we gradually develop our eternal
relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svarupa-siddhi. We should take
advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has therefore
sung, patita-pavana-hetu tava avatara: Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared as an incarnation to deliver all fallen souls
like us and directly bestow upon us love of Godhead. We must take advantage of this great benediction of the great
personality of Godhead.
