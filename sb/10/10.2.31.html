<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore
You are known as a desire tree [vancha-kalpataru]. When acaryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in
order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and
because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This statement reveals how the merciful acaryas and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help
the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His teachings to
Rupa Gosvami, said:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
One can achieve the seed of bhakti-lata, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and Krsna. The duty of the guru
is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to
render devotional service, which Krsna accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home,
back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks
shelter of such a guru, or acarya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the
circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the
candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The acarya's duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees
may render service according to references from sastra. Rupa Gosvami, for example, in order to help subsequent
devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the acarya to publish
books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to
Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Krsna consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and
followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities--illicit sex, intoxication, meateating
and gambling--and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western
countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridasa Thakura, but should follow
this method. Krsna will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed
in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The acarya gives the suitable method for crossing
the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the
followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called acarya-sampradaya.
It is therefore said, sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah (Padma Purana). The acarya-sampradaya is
strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the acarya-sampradaya; otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings:
tandera carana sevi bhakta sane vasa
janame janame haya, ei abhilasa
One must worship the lotus feet of the acarya and live within the society of devotees. Then one's endeavor to
cross over nescience will surely be successful.
