<h2>Text</h2>
padbhyam bhakta-hrdi-sthabhyam
vandyabhyam loka-vanditaih
angam yasyah samakramya
bhagavan api tat-stanam
yatudhany api sa svargam
avapa janani-gatim
krsna-bhukta-stana-ksirah
kim u gavo 'numatarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
padbhyam--by the two lotus feet; bhakta-hrdi-sthabhyam--which are always thought of by pure devotees, in
whose heart the Lord is therefore situated constantly; vandyabhyam--which are always to be praised; lokavanditaih--
by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, who are praised by all the inhabitants of the three worlds; angam--the
body; yasyah--of whom (Putana); samakramya--embracing; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; api--
also; tat-stanam--that breast; yatudhani api--although she was a witch (whose only business was to kill small
children and who had tried to kill Krsna also); sa--she; svargam--the transcendental abode; avapa--achieved; jananigatim--
the position of a mother; krsna-bhukta-stana-ksirah--therefore, because their breasts were sucked by Krsna,
who drank the milk flowing from their bodies; kim u--what to speak of; gavah--the cows; anumatarah--exactly like
mothers (who allowed their nipples to be sucked by Krsna).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is always situated within the core of the heart of the pure devotee,
and He is always offered prayers by such worshipable personalities as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Because Krsna
embraced Putana's body with great pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she attained the
position of a mother in the transcendental world and thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said
of the cows whose nipples Krsna sucked with great pleasure and who offered their milk very jubilantly with
affection exactly like that of a mother?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether directly
or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, becomes successful. Putana was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she
was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Kamsa to kill Krsna. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the
form of a very beautiful woman and approached Krsna exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Yasoda
and Rohini did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically
promoted to a position like that of mother Yasoda. As explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, there are
various roles one may play in such a position. Putana was immediately promoted to Vaikunthaloka, which is also
sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the
transcendental world. In Vaikunthaloka, Putana attained the position of a nurse (dhatry-ucitam), as described by
Uddhava. Putana was elevated to the position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka Vrndavana to assist mother
Yasoda.
