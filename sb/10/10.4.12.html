<h2>Text</h2>
tyaktva yastim sutam bhitam
vijnayarbhaka-vatsala
iyesa kila tam baddhum
damnatad-virya-kovida
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tyaktva--throwing away; yastim--the stick in her hand; sutam--her son; bhitam--considering her son's great fear;
vijnaya--understanding; arbhaka-vatsala--the most affectionate mother of Krsna; iyesa--desired; kila--indeed; tam--
Krsna; baddhum--to bind; damna--with a rope; a-tat-virya-kovida--without knowledge of the supremely powerful
Personality of Godhead (because of intense love for Krsna).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Mother Yasoda was always overwhelmed by intense love for Krsna, not knowing who Krsna was or how powerful
He was. Because of maternal affection for Krsna, she never even cared to know who He was. Therefore, when she
saw that her son had become excessively afraid, she threw the stick away and desired to bind Him so that He would
not commit any further naughty activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mother Yasoda wanted to bind Krsna not in order to chastise Him but because she thought that the child was so
restless that He might leave the house in fear. That would be another disturbance. Therefore, because of full
affection, to stop Krsna from leaving the house, she wanted to bind Him with rope. Mother Yasoda wanted to
impress upon Krsna that since He was afraid merely to see her stick, He should not perform such disturbing
activities as breaking the container of yogurt and butter and distributing its contents to the monkeys. Mother
Yasoda did not care to understand who Krsna was and how His power spreads everywhere. This is an example of
pure love for Krsna.
