<h2>Text</h2>
trnavartah santa-rayo
vatya-rupa-dharo haran
krsnam nabho-gato gantum
nasaknod bhuri-bhara-bhrt
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
trnavartah--the demon Trnavarta; santa-rayah--the force of the blast reduced; vatya-rupa-dharah--who had
assumed the form of a forceful whirlwind; haran--and had thus taken away; krsnam--Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; nabhah-gatah--went up to the top of the sky; gantum--to go further; na asaknot--was not
able; bhuri-bhara-bhrt--because Krsna then became more powerful and heavy than the demon.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having assumed the form of a forceful whirlwind, the demon Trnavarta took Krsna very high in the sky, but
when Krsna became heavier than the demon, the demon had to stop his force and could go no further.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is a competition in yogic power between Krsna and Trnavartasura. By practicing mystic yoga, asuras
generally attain some perfection in the eight siddhis, or perfections, namely anima, laghima, mahima, prapti,
prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita. But although a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited
extent, he cannot compete with the mystic power of Krsna, for Krsna is Yogesvara, the source of all mystic power
(yatra yogesvaro harih). No one can compete with Krsna. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental
portion of Krsna's mystic power, asuras demonstrate their power to the foolish public and assert themselves to be
God, not knowing that God is the supreme Yogesvara. Here also we see that Trnavarta assumed the mahima-siddhi
and took Krsna away as if Krsna were an ordinary child. But Krsna also became a mystic mahima-siddha. When
mother Yasoda was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying
Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus Trnavarta had been able to take Krsna
away in the presence of mother Yasoda. But when Krsna, high in the sky, assumed the mahima-siddhi, the demon,
unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to Krsna's desire. One should not,
therefore, compete with Krsna's mystic power.
Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with Krsna. Instead, they fully
surrender to Krsna, and their yogic power is demonstrated by Krsna's mercy. Devotees can show mystic yoga so
powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense
gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to
that of the demons. There are many karmis, yogis and jnanis who artificially try to compete with Krsna, and thus
ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam from authorities consider some rascal yogi to
be Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called babas who
present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard
them as God because of lacking knowledge of Krsna.
