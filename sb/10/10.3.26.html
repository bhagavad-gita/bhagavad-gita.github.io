<h2>Text</h2>
yo 'yam kalas tasya te 'vyakta-bandho
cestam ahus cestate yena visvam
nimesadir vatsaranto mahiyams
tam tvesanam ksema-dhama prapadye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--that which; ayam--this; kalah--time (minutes, hours, seconds); tasya--of Him; te--of You; avyakta-bandho--
O my Lord, You are the inaugurator of the unmanifested (the original mahat-tattva or prakrti); cestam--attempt or
pastimes; ahuh--it is said; cestate--works; yena--by which; visvam--the entire creation; nimesa-adih--beginning with
minute parts of time; vatsara-antah--up to the limit of a year; mahiyan--powerful; tam--unto Your Lordship; tva
isanam--unto You, the supreme controller; ksema-dhama--the reservoir of all auspiciousness; prapadye--I offer full
surrender.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O inaugurator of the material energy, this wonderful creation works under the control of powerful time, which is
divided into seconds, minutes, hours and years. This element of time, which extends for many millions of years, is
but another form of Lord Visnu. For Your pastimes, You act as the controller of time, but You are the reservoir of
all good fortune. Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.52):
yac-caksur esa savita sakala-grahanam
raja samasta-sura-murtir asesa-tejah
yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light. I worship Govinda, the
primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be
the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time." Although we see the cosmic manifestation as
gigantic and wonderful, it is within the limitations of kala, the time factor. This time factor is also controlled by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram).
Prakrti, the cosmic manifestation, is under the control of time. Indeed, everything is under the control of time, and
time is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord has no fear of the
onslaughts of time. Time is estimated according to the movements of the sun (savita). Every minute, every second,
every day, every night, every month and every year of time can be calculated according to the sun's movements.
But the sun is not independent, for it is under time's control. Bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakrah: the sun moves within
the kala-cakra, the orbit of time. The sun is under the control of time, and time is controlled by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord has no fear of time.
The Lord is addressed here as avyakta-bandhu, or the inaugurator of the movements of the entire cosmic
manifestation. Sometimes the cosmic manifestation is compared to a potter's wheel. When a potter's wheel is
spinning, who has set it in motion? It is the potter, of course, although sometimes we can see only the motion of
the wheel and cannot see the potter himself. Therefore the Lord, who is behind the motion of the cosmos, is called
avyakta-bandhu. Everything is within the limits of time, but time moves under the direction of the Lord, who is
therefore not within time's limit.
