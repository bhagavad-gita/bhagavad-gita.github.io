<h2>Text</h2>
aho brahma-vidam vaco
nasatyah santi karhicit
gargo yad aha bhagavan
anvabhavi tathaiva tat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--how wonderful it is; brahma-vidam--of persons who have full knowledge of Brahman, transcendence;
vacah--the words; na--never; asatyah--untruth; santi--become; karhicit--at any time; gargah--Gargamuni; yat--
whatever; aha--predicted; bhagavan--Gargamuni, the most powerful; anvabhavi--is exactly happening; tatha eva--
as; tat--that.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The words of persons in full knowledge of Brahman never become untrue. It is very wonderful that whatever
Gargamuni predicted we are now actually experiencing in all detail.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The purpose of human life is indicated in the Brahma-sutra: athato brahma jijnasa. To make one's life perfect--in
the past, present and future--one must learn about Brahman. Because of intense affection, Nanda Maharaja could
not understand Krsna as He is. Gargamuni was able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the
Vedas, but Nanda Maharaja could not understand Krsna directly. Because of his intense love for Krsna, he forgot
who Krsna was and could not understand Krsna's potency. Although Krsna is Narayana Himself, Gargamuni did
not disclose this. Thus Nanda Maharaja appreciated the words of Gargamuni, but because of his deep affection he
could not understand who Krsna was, although Gargamuni had said that Krsna's qualities would be exactly like
those of Narayana.
