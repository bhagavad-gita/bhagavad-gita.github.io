<p>

<h2>Text</h2>
phala-vikrayini tasya
cyuta-dhanya-kara-dvayam
phalair apurayad ratnaih
phala-bhandam apuri ca
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
phala-vikrayini--the aborigine fruit vendor, who was an elderly woman; tasya--of Krsna; cyuta-dhanya--the paddy
He brought to barter having mostly fallen; kara-dvayam--palms of the hands; phalaih apurayat--the fruit vendor
filled His small palms with fruits; ratnaih--in exchange for jewels and gold; phala-bhandam--the basket of fruit;
apuri ca--filled.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Krsna was going to the fruit vendor very hastily, most of the grains He was holding fell. Nonetheless, the
fruit vendor filled Krsna's hands with fruits, and her fruit basket was immediately filled with jewels and gold.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (9.26) Krsna says:
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
Krsna is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some water, He will immediately accept it.
The only condition is that these things should be offered with bhakti (yo me bhaktya prayacchati). Otherwise, if
one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, "I have so much opulence, and I am giving something to Krsna,"
one's offering will not be accepted by Krsna. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine
class, dealt with Krsna with great affection, saying, "Krsna, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for
grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like." Thus she filled Krsna's palms with
whatever fruits He could carry. In exchange, Krsna filled her whole basket with jewels and gold.
From this incident one should learn that for anything offered to Krsna with love and affection, Krsna can
reciprocate many millions of times over, both materially and spiritually. The basic principle involved is an
exchange of love. Therefore Krsna teaches in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
"O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you
may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me." With love and affection, one should try to give something to
Krsna from one's source of income. Then one's life will be successful. Krsna is full in all opulences; He does not
need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to Krsna, that is for one's own benefit. The
example given in this connection is that when one's real face is decorated, the reflection of one's face is
automatically decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve Krsna with all our opulences, we, as parts and parcels or
reflections of Krsna, will become happy in exchange. Krsna is always happy, for He is atmarama, fully satisfied with
His own opulence.
