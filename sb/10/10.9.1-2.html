<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: One day when mother Yasoda saw that all the maidservants were engaged in
other household affairs, she personally began to churn the yogurt. While churning, she remembered the childish
activities of Krsna, and in her own way she composed songs and enjoyed singing to herself about all those
activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, quoting from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Sanatana Gosvami, says that the
incident of Krsna's breaking the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Yasoda took place on the Dipavali Day,
or Dipa-malika. Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of Kartika by
fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Maharaja,
several of mother Yasoda's cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk.
Mother Yasoda wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally,
since she thought that this child Krsna was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gopis to steal butter
because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared.
While churning the butter, mother Yasoda was singing about the childhood activities of Krsna. It was formerly a
custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done
by a professional poet. It appears that mother Yasoda did not want to forget Krsna's activities at any time. Therefore
she poeticized all of Krsna's childhood activities, such as the killing of Putana, Aghasura, Sakatasura and Trnavarta,
and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of
persons eager to remain Krsna conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how Krsna conscious
mother Yasoda was. To stay in Krsna consciousness, we should follow such persons.
