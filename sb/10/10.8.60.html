<h2>Translation</h2>
Vrndavana is the transcendental abode of the Lord, where there is no hunger, anger or thirst. Though naturally
inimical, both human beings and fierce animals live there together in transcendental friendship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word vana means "forest." We are afraid of the forest and do not wish to go there, but in Vrndavana the
forest animals are as good as demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the forest the animals
live together, and when they go to drink water they do not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense
gratification, but in Vrndavana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is Krsna's satisfaction. Even in this
material world, the animals in Vrndavana are not envious of the sadhus who live there. The sadhus keep cows and
supply milk to the tigers, saying, "Come here and take a little milk." Thus envy and malice are unknown in
Vrndavana. That is the difference between Vrndavana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the name of
vana, the forest, but in Vrndavana there is no such horror. Everyone there is happy by pleasing Krsna.
Krsnotkirtana-gana-nartana-parau. Whether a gosvami or a tiger or other ferocious animal, everyone's business is
the same--to please Krsna. Even the tigers are also devotees. This is the specific qualification of Vrndavana. In
Vrndavana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the dog is happy, the man is happy--everyone.
Everyone wants to serve Krsna in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may sometimes think that the
monkeys in Vrndavana are envious, because they cause mischief and steal food, but in Vrndavana we find that the
monkeys are allowed to take butter, which Krsna Himself distributes. Krsna personally demonstrates that everyone
has the right to live. This is Vrndavana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life. The
inhabitants of Vrndavana think, "Whatever is given by Krsna, let us divide it as prasada and eat." This mentality
cannot appear all of a sudden, but it will gradually develop with Krsna consciousness; by sadhana, one can come to
this platform.
In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order to distribute food freely, yet those to
whom the food is given may not even feel appreciative. The value of Krsna consciousness, however, will gradually
be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the temple of the Hare Krsna movement in Durban,
South Africa, the Durban Post reported, "All the devotees here are very active in the service of Lord Krsna, and the
results are obvious to see: happiness, good health, peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities." This
is the nature of Vrndavana. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah: without Krsna consciousness, happiness is
impossible; one may struggle, but one cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society the
opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all good qualities through God consciousness.
