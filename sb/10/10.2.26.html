<h2>Text</h2>
satya-vratam satya-param tri-satyam
satyasya yonim nihitam ca satye
satyasya satyam rta-satya-netram
satyatmakam tvam saranam prapannah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
satya-vratam--the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow
).
To honor this vow, the Lord appeared.
*; satya-param--who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, satyam param
dhimahi); tri-satyam--He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation,
during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya--of all relative truths, which are emanations from
the Absolute Truth, Krsna; yonim--t;he cause; nihitam--entered). Therefore He is called antaryami, the inner force.
*; ca--and; satye--in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements--earth, water, fire, air and
ether); satyasya--of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam--the Lord is the original truth; rta-satya-netram--He is
the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-atmakam--everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (saccid-
ananda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tvam--unto you, O Lord;
saranam--offering our full surrender; prapannah--we are completely under Your protection.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You
decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic
manifestation--creation, maintenance and annihilation--You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is
completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the
active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryami, the
inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the
beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demigods or devotees know perfectly well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true substance,
whether within this material world or in the spiritual world. Srimad-Bhagavatam begins, therefore, with the words
om namo bhagavate vasudevaya. .. satyam param dhimahi. Vasudeva, Krsna, is the param satyam, the Supreme
Truth. The Supreme Truth can be approached or understood by the supreme method, as declared by the Supreme
Truth: bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg. 18.55). Bhakti, devotional service, is the only way to
understand the Absolute Truth. For protection, therefore, the demigods surrender to the Supreme Truth, not to the
relative truth. There are persons who worship various demigods, but the Supreme Truth, Krsna, declares in
Bhagavad-gita (7.23), antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: "Men of small intelligence worship the
demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." Worship of demigods may be useful for a limited time, but
the result is antavat, perishable. This material world is impermanent, the demigods are impermanent, and the
benedictions derived from the demigods are also impermanent, whereas the living entity is eternal (nityo nityanam
cetanas cetananam). Every living entity, therefore, must search for eternal happiness, not temporary happiness. The
words satyam param dhimahi indicate that one should search for the Absolute Truth, not the relative truth.
While offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nrsimhadeva, Prahlada Maharaja said:
balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha
nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh
Generally it is understood that the protectors for a child are his parents, but this is not actually the fact. The real
protector is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas
tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam
(Bhag. 7.9.19)
If neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a child, despite the presence of his parents, will suffer, and a
diseased person, despite all medical help, will die. In this material world, where there is a struggle for existence,
men have invented many means for protection, but these are useless if the Supreme Personality of Godhead rejects
them. Therefore the demigods purposefully say, satyatmakam tvam saranam prapannah: "Real protection can be
obtained from You, O Lord, and therefore we surrender unto You,"
The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja), and He
further says:
sakrd eva prapanno yas
tavasmiti ca yacate
abhayam sarvada tasmai
dadamy etad vratam mama
"If one surrenders unto Me sincerely, saying, 'My Lord, from this day I am fully surrendered unto You,' I always
give him protection. That is My vow." (Ramayana, Yuddha-kanda 18.33) The demigods offered their prayers to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because He had now appeared in the womb of His devotee Devaki to protect all
the devotees harassed by Kamsa and his lieutenants. Thus the Lord acts as satyavrata. The protection given by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to the protection given by the demigods. It is said that
Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Siva, but when Lord Ramacandra went to kill him, Lord Siva could not give
him protection.
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, accompanied by great sages like Narada and followed by many other demigods, had
now invisibly appeared in the house of Kamsa. They began to pray for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
select prayers which are very pleasing to the devotees and which award fulfillment of devotional desires. The first
words they spoke acclaimed that the Lord is true to His vow. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, Krsna descends upon
this material world just to protect the pious and destroy the impious. That is His vow. The demigods could
understand that the Lord had taken His residence within the womb of Devaki to fulfill this vow. They were very
glad that the Lord was appearing to fulfill His mission, and they addressed Him as satyam param, or the Supreme
Absolute Truth.
Everyone is searching after the truth. That is the philosophical way of life. The demigods give information that
the Supreme Absolute Truth is Krsna. One who becomes fully Krsna conscious can attain the Absolute Truth.
Krsna is the Absolute Truth. Relative truth is not truth in all the three phases of eternal time. Time is divided into
past, present and future. Krsna is Truth always, past, present and future. In the material world, everything is being
controlled by supreme time, in the course of past, present and future. But before the creation, Krsna was existing,
and when there is creation, everything is resting in Krsna, and when this creation is finished, Krsna will remain.
Therefore, He is Absolute Truth in all circumstances, If there is any truth within this material world, it emanates
from the Supreme Truth, Krsna. If there is any opulence within this material world, the cause of the opulence is
Krsna. If there is any reputation within this material world, the cause of the reputation is Krsna. If there is any
strength within this material world, the cause of such strength is Krsna. If there is any wisdom and education
within this material world, the cause of such wisdom and education is Krsna. Therefore Krsna is the source of all
relative truths.
Devotees, therefore, following in the footsteps of Lord Brahma, pray, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami,
worshiping the adi-purusa, the supreme truth, Govinda. Everything, everywhere, is performed in terms of three
principles, jnana-bala-kriya--knowledge, strength and activity. In every field, if there is not full knowledge, full
strength and full activity, an endeavor is never successful. Therefore, if one wants success in everything, one must
be backed by these three principles. In the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) there is this statement about the
Supreme Personality of Godhead:
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to do anything personally, for He has such potencies that
anything He wants done will be done perfectly well through the control of material nature (svabhaviki jnana-balakriya
ca). Similarly, those who are engaged in the service of the Lord are not meant to struggle for existence. The
devotees who are fully engaged in spreading the Krsna consciousness movement, more than ten thousand men and
women all over the world, have no steady or permanent occupation, yet we actually see that they are maintained
very opulently. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.22):
ananyas cintayanto mam
ye janah paryupasate
tesam nityabhiyuktanam
yoga-ksemam vahamy aham
"For those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form, I carry to them what they lack
and preserve what they have." The devotees have no anxiety over what will happen next, where they will stay or
what they will eat, for everything is maintained and supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has
promised, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never
perishes." (Bg. 9.31) From all angles of vision, therefore, in all circumstances, if one fully surrenders unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of one's struggling for existence. In this connection, the
commentary by Sripada Madhvacarya, who quotes from the Tantra-bhagavata, is very meaningful:
sac-chadba uttamam bruyad
anandantiti vai vadet
yetijnanam samuddistam
purnananda-drsis tatah
attrtvac ca tada danat
satyattya cocyate vibhuh
Explaining the words satyasya yonim, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that Krsna is the avatari, the
origin of all incarnations. All incarnations are the Absolute Truth, yet the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna is
the origin of all incarnations. Diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya dipayate (Brahma-samhita 5.46). There may
be many lamps, all equal in power, yet there is a first lamp, a second lamp, a third lamp and so on. Similarly, there
are many incarnations, who are compared to lamps, but the first lamp, the original Personality of Godhead, is
Krsna. Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami.
The demigods must offer worship in obedience to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one might argue that
since the Supreme Godhead was within the womb of Devaki, He was also coming in a material body. Why then
should He be worshiped? Why should one make a distinction between an ordinary living entity and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead? These questions are answered in the following verses.
