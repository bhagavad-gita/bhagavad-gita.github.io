<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
athainam atmajam viksya
maha-purusa-laksanam
devaki tam upadhavat
kamsad bhita suvismita
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; atha--after this offering of prayers by Vasudeva; enam--this Krsna;
atmajam--their son; viksya--observing; maha-purusa-laksanam--with all the symptoms of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Visnu; devaki--Krsna's mother; tam--unto Him (Krsna); upadhavat--offered prayers; kamsat--of
Kamsa; bhita--being afraid; su-vismita--and also being astonished by seeing such a wonderful child.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, having seen that her child had all the symptoms of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Devaki, who was very much afraid of Kamsa and unusually astonished, began to offer
prayers to the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word suvismita, meaning "astonished," is significant in this verse. Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, were
assured that their child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead and could not be killed by Kamsa, but because of
affection, as they thought of Kamsa's previous atrocities, they were simultaneously afraid that Krsna would be
killed. This is why the word suvismita has been used. Similarly, we are also astounded upon thinking of whether
this movement will be killed by the asuras or will continue to advance without fear.
