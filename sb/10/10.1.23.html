<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vasudeva-grhe--in the house of Vasudeva (who would be the father of Krsna when the Lord appeared); saksat--
personally; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has full potency; purusah--the original person;
parah--who is transcendental; janisyate--will appear; tat-priya-artham--and for His satisfaction; sambhavantu--
should take birth; sura-striyah--all the wives of the demigods.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who has full potency, will personally appear as the son of
Vasudeva. Therefore all the wives of the demigods should also appear in order to satisfy Him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: after giving up the material
body, the devotee of the Lord returns home, back to Godhead. This means that the devotee is first transferred to
the particular universe where the Lord is at that time staying to exhibit His pastimes. There are innumerable
universes, and the Lord is appearing in one of these universes at every moment. Therefore His pastimes are called
nitya-lila, eternal pastimes. The Lord's appearance as a child in the house of Devaki takes place continuously in one
universe after another. Therefore, the devotee is first transferred to that particular universe where the pastimes of
the Lord are current. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, even if a devotee does not complete the course of devotional
service, he enjoys the happiness of the heavenly planets, where the most pious people dwell, and then takes birth
in the house of a suci or sriman, a pious brahmana or a wealthy vaisya (sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto
'bhijayate). Thus a pure devotee, even if unable to execute devotional service completely, is transferred to the
upper planetary system, where pious people reside. From there, if his devotional service is complete, such a
devotee is transferred to the place where the Lord's pastimes are going on. Herein it is said, sambhavantu surastriyah.
Sura-stri, the women of the heavenly planets, were thus ordered to appear in the Yadu dynasty in
Vrndavana to enrich the pastimes of Lord Krsna. These sura-stri, when further trained to live with Krsna, would be
transferred to the original Goloka Vrndavana. During Lord Krsna's pastimes within this world, the sura-stri were to
appear in different ways in different families to give pleasure to the Lord, just so that they would be fully trained
before going to the eternal Goloka Vrndavana. With the association of Lord Krsna, either at Dvaraka-puri,
Mathura-puri or Vrndavana, they would certainly return home, back to Godhead. Among the sura-stri, the women
of the heavenly planets, there are many devotees, such as the mother of the Upendra incarnation of Krsna. It was
such devoted women who were called for in this connection.
