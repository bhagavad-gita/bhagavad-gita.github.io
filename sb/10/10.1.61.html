<h2>Translation</h2>
The inhabitants of Vrndavana, headed by Nanda Maharaja and including his associate cowherd men and their
wives, were none but denizens of the heavenly planets, O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the descendants of Bharata, and
so too were the descendants of the Vrsni dynasty, headed by Vasudeva, and Devaki and the other women of the
dynasty of Yadu. The friends, relatives and well-wishers of both Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva and even those who
externally appeared to be followers of Kamsa were all demigods.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As previously discussed, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, informed Lord Brahma that Lord Krsna
would personally descend to mitigate the suffering on the earth. The Lord ordered all the denizens of the heavenly
planets to take birth in different families of the Yadu and Vrsni dynasties and in Vrndavana. Now this verse informs
us that all the family and friends of the Yadu dynasty, the Vrsni dynasty, Nanda Maharaja and the gopas descended
from the heavenly planets to see the pastimes of the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), the Lord's pastimes
consist of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--saving the devotees and killing the demons. To
demonstrate these activities, the Lord called for devotees from different parts of the universe.
There are many devotees who are elevated to the higher planetary systems.
prapya punya-krtam lokan
usitva sasvatih samah
sucinam srimatam gehe
yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate
"The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born
into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy." (Bg. 6.41) Some devotees, having failed to
complete the process of devotional service, are promoted to the heavenly planets, to which the pious are elevated,
and after enjoying there they may be directly promoted to the place where the Lord's pastimes are going on. When
Lord Krsna was to appear, the denizens of the heavenly planets were invited to see the pastimes of the Lord, and
thus it is stated here that the members of the Yadu and Vrsni dynasties and the inhabitants of Vrndavana were
demigods or almost as good as demigods. Even those who externally helped the activities of Kamsa belonged to the
higher planetary systems. The imprisonment and release of Vasudeva and the killing of various demons were all
manifestations of the pastimes of the Lord, and because the devotees would be pleased to see these activities
personally, they were all invited to take birth as friends and relatives of these families. As confirmed in the prayers
of Kunti (Bhag. 1.8.19), nato natya-dharo yatha. The Lord was to play the part of a demon-killer, and a friend, son
and brother to His devotees, and thus these devotees were all summoned.
