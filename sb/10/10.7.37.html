<h2>Text</h2>
etat kaumarajam karma
harer atmahi-moksanam
mrtyoh paugandake bala
drstvocur vismita vraje
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--this incident of delivering both Aghasura and Krsna's associates from death; kaumara-jam karma--performed
during their kaumara age (the age of five years); hareh--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; atma--the devotees
are the Lord's heart and soul; ahi-moksanam--their deliverance and the deliverance of the python; mrtyoh--from
the path of repeated birth and death; paugandake--at the age of pauganda, beginning with the sixth year (one year
later); balah--all the boys; drstva ucuh--disclosed the fact after one year; vismitah--as if it had happened on that
very day; vraje--in Vrndavana.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This incident of Krsna's saving Himself and His associates from death and of giving deliverance to Aghasura, who
had assumed the form of a python, took place when Krsna was five years old. It was disclosed in Vrajabhumi after
one year, as if it had taken place on that very day.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word moksanam means "liberation." For the associates of Krsna and for Krsna Himself, there is no question
about liberation; they are already liberated, being in the spiritual world. In the material world there are birth,
death, old age and disease, but in the spiritual world there are no such things because everything is eternal. As for
the python, however, by the association of Krsna and His devotees, Aghasura also achieved the same facility of
eternal life. Therefore, as indicated here by the word atmahi-moksanam, if the python Aghasura could receive
eternal association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are already associates
of the Lord? Sakam vijahruh krta-punya-punjah (Bhag. 10.12.11). Here is proof that God is good for everyone.
Even when He kills someone, the one who is killed attains liberation. What then is to be said of those who are
already in the association of the Lord?
