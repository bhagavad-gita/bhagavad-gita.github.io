<h2>Text</h2>
jyotir yathaivodaka-parthivesv adah
samira-veganugatam vibhavyate
evam sva-maya-racitesv asau puman

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jyotih--the luminaries in the sky, such as the sun, the moon and the stars; yatha--as; eva--indeed; udaka--in
water; parthivesu--or in other liquids, like oil; adah--directly; samira-vega-anugatam--being forced by the
movements of the wind; vibhavyate--appear in different shapes; evam--in this way; sva-maya-racitesu--in the
situation created by one's mental concoctions; asau--the living entity; puman--person; gunesu--in the material
world, manifested by the modes of nature; raga-anugatah--according to his attachment; vimuhyati--becomes
bewildered by identification.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water,
they appear to be of different shapes--sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on--because of the movements of
the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various
manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions
because of agitation from the material modes of nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse gives a very good example by which to understand the different positions of the eternal spiritual soul
in the material world and how the soul takes on different bodies (dehantara-praptih). The moon is stationary and is
one, but when it is reflected in water or oil, it appears to take different shapes because of the movements of the
wind. Similarly, the soul is the eternal servant of Krsna, the Supreme personality of Godhead, but when put into
the material modes of nature, it takes different bodies, sometimes as a demigod, sometimes a man, a dog, a tree and
so on. By the influence of maya, the illusory potency of the Supreme personality of Godhead, the living entity
thinks that he is this person, that person, American, Indian, cat, dog, tree or whatever. This is called maya. When
one is freed from this bewilderment and understands that the soul does not belong to any shape of this material
world, one is situated on the spiritual platform (brahma-bhuta).
This realization is sometimes explained as nirakara, or formlessness. This formlessness, however, does not mean
that the soul has no form. The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material
contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as nirakara, which means that God has no material form but
is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, but his
material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms
(sac-cid-ananda-vigraha), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is,
whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living
entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as
the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the
supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.19). Bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate. When the living entity, after many, many births in different forms, returns to his
original form of Krsna consciousness, he immediately surrenders unto the lotus feet of the supreme form, Krsna.
This is liberation. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He
never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains
pure devotional service unto Me." Surrender unto the supreme form is the result of bhakti. This bhakti, or
understanding of one's own position, is the complete liberation. As long as one is under an impersonal
understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge.
Kleso 'dhikataras tesam avyaktasakta-cetasam (Bg. 12.5). Although one may be spiritually advanced, if one is
attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth one must still work very hard, as indicated by the words
kleso 'dhikatarah, which mean "greater suffering." A devotee, however, easily attains his original position as a
spiritual form and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form.
Krsna Himself explains the forms of the living entities in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, where He clearly
says to Arjuna that He, Arjuna and all other living entities, who were previously in their original forms, are separate
individual identities. They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future
they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity
appears in various material forms, whereas Krsna appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who
are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that Krsna is like one of them and that His form is like their material
forms. Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg. 9.11). Krsna is never puffed up by material knowledge
and is therefore called acyuta, whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the
difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities.
In this connection it is to be noted that Vasudeva, who was situated in a transcendental position, advised Kamsa
not to commit further sinful activities. Kamsa, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill Krsna, or
God, whereas Vasudeva represents a transcendentally situated person to whom Krsna is born (Vasudeva is the son
of Vasudeva). Vasudeva wanted his brother-in-law Kamsa to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since
the result of being agitated by material nature would be that Kamsa would have to accept a body in which to suffer
again and again. Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.4), Rsabhadeva also says:
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
As long as the living entity is entangled in the fruitive activities of so-called happiness and distress, he will receive
a particular type of body in which to endure the three kinds of suffering due to material nature (tri-tapa-yantrana).
An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and
revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, Krsna. As long as one is
materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that
an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life
in advancing in Krsna consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (tyaktva deham punar
janma naiti), he will return home, back to Godhead.
