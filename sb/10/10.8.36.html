<h2>Text</h2>
kim etad adbhutam iva
vasudeve 'khilatmani
vrajasya satmanas tokesv
apurvam prema vardhate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kim--what; etat--this; adbhutam--wonderful; iva--just as; vasudeve--in Vasudeva, Lord Sri Krsna; akhila-atmani--
the Supersoul of all living entities; vrajasya--of all the inhabitants of Vraja; sa-atmanah--along with Me; tokesu--in
these boys; apurvam--unprecedented; prema--affection; vardhate--is increasing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What is this wonderful phenomenon? The affection of all the inhabitants of Vraja, including Me, toward these
boys and calves is increasing as never before, just like our affection for Lord Krsna, the Supersoul of all living
entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This increase of affection was not maya; rather, because Krsna had expanded Himself as everything and because
the whole life of everyone in Vrndavana was meant for Krsna, the cows, because of affection for Krsna, had more
affection for the older calves than for the new calves, and the men increased in their affection for their sons.
Balarama was astonished to see all the residents of Vrndavana so affectionate toward their own children, exactly as
they had been for Krsna. Similarly, the cows had grown affectionate toward their calves--as much as toward Krsna.
Balarama was surprised to see the acts of yogamaya. Therefore He inquired from Krsna, "What is happening here?
What is this mystery?"
