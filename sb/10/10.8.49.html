<h2>Text</h2>
anghri-mastakam apurnas

komalaih sarva-gatresu

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
a-anghri-mastakam--from the feet up to the top of the head; apurnah--fully decorated; tulasi-nava-damabhih--
with garlands of fresh tulasi leaves; komalaih--tender, soft; sarva-gatresu--on all the limbs of the body; bhuripunyavat-
arpitaih--which were offered by devotees engaged in the greatest pious activity, worshiping the Supreme
Lord by hearing, chanting and so on.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Every part of Their bodies, from Their feet to the top of Their heads, was fully decorated with fresh, tender
garlands of tulasi leaves offered by devotees engaged in worshiping the Lord by the greatest pious activities, namely
hearing and chanting.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word bhuri-punyavad-arpitaih is significant in this verse. These forms of Visnu were worshiped by those
who had performed pious activities (sukrtibhih) for many births and who were constantly engaged in devotional
service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh). Bhakti, devotional service, is the engagement of those who have performed
highly developed pious activities. The accumulation of pious activities has already been mentioned elsewhere in
the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.12.11), where Sukadeva Gosvami says,
ittham satam brahma-sukhanubhutya
dasyam gatanam para-daivatena
mayasritanam nara-darakena
sakam vijahruh krta-punya-punjah
"Those who are engaged in self-realization, appreciating the Brahman effulgence of the Lord, and those engaged
in devotional service, accepting the Supreme personality of Godhead as master, as well as those who are under the
clutches of maya, thinking the Lord an ordinary person, cannot understand that certain exalted personalities--after
accumulating volumes of pious activities--are now playing with the Lord in friendship as cowherd boys."
In our Krsna-Balarama Temple in Vrndavana, there is a tamala tree that covers an entire corner of the courtyard.
Before there was a temple the tree was lying neglected, but now it has developed very luxuriantly, covering the
whole corner of the courtyard. This is a sign of bhuri-punya.
