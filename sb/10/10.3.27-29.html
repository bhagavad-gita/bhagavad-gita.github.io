<h2>Translation</h2>
The evil witches known as Dakinis, Yatudhanis and Kusmandas are the greatest enemies of children, and the evil
spirits like Bhutas, Pretas, Pisacas, Yaksas, Raksasas and Vinayakas, as well as witches like Kotara, Revati, Jyestha,
Putana and Matrka, are always ready to give trouble to the body, the life air and the senses, causing loss of memory,
madness and bad dreams. Like the most experienced evil stars, they all create great disturbances, especially for
children, but one can vanquish them simply by uttering Lord Visnu's name, for when Lord Visnu's name resounds,
all of them become afraid and go away.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33):
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person--nondual, infallible, and
without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the
oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot
be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees."
While decorating the body with tilaka, we give protection to the body by chanting twelve names of Visnu.
Although Govinda, or Lord Visnu, is one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But if
one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant, "Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu," and
always think of Lord Visnu. Visnor aradhanam param: this is the highest form of worship. If one remembers Visnu
always, even though one is disturbed by many bad elements, one can be protected without a doubt. The Ayurvedasastra
recommends, ausadhi cintayet visnum: even while taking medicine, one should remember Visnu, because
the medicine is not all and all and Lord Visnu is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (padam
padam yad vipadam). Therefore one must become a Vaisnava and think of Visnu constantly. This is made easier by
the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended, kirtaniyah
sada harih, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam, and kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet.
