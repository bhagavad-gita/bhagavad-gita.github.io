<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
asatah sri-madandhasya
daridryam param anjanam
atmaupamyena bhutani
daridrah param iksate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asatah--of such a foolish rascal; sri-mada-andhasya--who is blinded by temporarily possessing riches and
opulence; daridryam--poverty; param anjanam--the best ointment for the eyes, by which to see things as they are;
atma-aupamyena--with comparison to himself; bhutani--living beings; daridrah--a poverty-stricken man; param--
perfectly; iksate--can see things as they are.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Atheistic fools and rascals who are very much proud of wealth fail to see things as they are. Therefore, returning
them to poverty is the proper ointment for their eyes so they may see things as they are. At least a poverty-stricken
man can realize how painful poverty is, and therefore he will not want others to be in a painful condition like his
own.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even today, if a man who was formerly poverty-stricken gets money, he is inclined to utilize his money to
perform many philanthropic activities, like opening schools for uneducated men and hospitals for the diseased. In
this connection there is an instructive story called punar musiko bhava, "Again Become a Mouse." A mouse was
very much harassed by a cat, and therefore the mouse approached a saintly person to request to become a cat.
When the mouse became a cat, he was harassed by a dog, and then when he became a dog, he was harassed by a
tiger. But when he became a tiger, he stared at the saintly person, and when the saintly person asked him, "What
do you want?" the tiger said, "I want to eat you." Then the saintly person cursed him, saying, "May you again
become a mouse." A similar thing is going on all over the universe. One is going up and down, sometimes
becoming a mouse, sometimes a tiger, and so on. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
The living entities are promoted and degraded by the laws of nature, but if one is very, very fortunate, by
association with saintly persons he gets the seed of devotional service, and his life becomes successful. Narada
Muni wanted to bring Nalakuvara and Manigriva to the platform of devotional service through poverty, and thus
he cursed them. Such is the mercy of a Vaisnava. Unless one is brought to the Vaisnava platform, one cannot be a
good man. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah (Bhag. 5.18.12). An avaisnava never becomes a good man,
however severely he is punished.
