<h2>Text</h2>
jyotisam ayanam saksad
yat taj jnanam atindriyam
pranitam bhavata yena
puman veda paravaram
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jyotisam--knowledge of astrology (along with other aspects of culture in human society, and specifically in
civilized society, there must be knowledge of astrology); ayanam--the movements of the stars and planets in
relationship to human society; saksat--directly; yat tat jnanam--such knowledge; ati-indriyam--which an ordinary
person cannot understand because it is beyond his vision; pranitam bhavata--you have prepared a perfect book of
knowledge; yena--by which; puman--any person; veda--can understand; para-avaram--the cause and effect of
destiny.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O great saintly person, you have compiled the astrological knowledge by which one can understand past and
present unseen things. By the strength of this knowledge, any human being can understand what he has done in
his past life and how it affects his present life. This is known to you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word "destiny" is now defined. Unintelligent persons who do not understand the meaning of life are just like
animals. Animals do not know the past, present and future of life, nor are they able to understand it. But a human
being can understand this, if he is sober. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.13), dhiras tatra na muhyati: a
sober person is not bewildered. The simple truth is that although life is eternal, in this material world one changes
from one body to another. Foolish people, especially in this age, do not understand this simple truth. Krsna says:
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly
passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." (Bg. 2.13) Krsna, the
greatest authority, says that the body will change. And as soon as the body changes, one's whole program of work
changes also. Today I am a human being or a great personality, but with a little deviation from nature's law, I shall
have to accept a different type of body. Today I am a human being, but tomorrow I may become a dog, and then
whatever activities I have performed in this life will be a failure. This simple truth is now rarely understood, but
one who is a dhira can understand this. Those in this material world for material enjoyment should know that
because their present position will cease to exist, they must be careful in how they act. This is also stated by
Rsabhadeva. Na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam asann api klesada asa dehah (Bhag. 5.5.4). Although this body is
temporary, as long as we have to live in this body we must suffer. Whether one has a short life or a long life, one
must suffer the threefold miseries of material life. Therefore any gentleman, dhira, must be interested in jyotisa,
astrology.
Nanda Maharaja was trying to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Gargamuni's presence, for
Gargamuni was a great authority in this knowledge of astrology, by which one can see the unseen events of past,
present and future. It is the duty of a father to understand the astrological position of his children and do what is
needed for their happiness. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of Gargamuni,
Nanda Maharaja suggested that Gargamuni prepare a horoscope for Nanda's two sons, Krsna and Balarama.
