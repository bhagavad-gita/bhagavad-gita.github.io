<h2>Translation</h2>
In the ears of the gopis were brilliantly polished jeweled earrings, and from their necks hung metal lockets. Their
hands were decorated with bangles, their dresses were of varied colors, and from their hair, flowers fell onto the
street like showers. Thus while going to the house of Maharaja Nanda, the gopis, their earrings, breasts and
garlands moving, were brilliantly beautiful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The description of the gopis, who were going to the house of Maharaja Nanda to welcome Krsna, is especially
significant. The gopis were not ordinary women, but expansions of Krsna's pleasure potency, as described in the
Brahma-samhita (5.37,29):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuto
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
(5.37)
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksalaksavrtesu
surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
(5.29)
Krsna is always worshiped by the gopis wherever He goes. Therefore Krsna is so vividly described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has also described Krsna in this way: ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhuvargena
ya kalpita. All these gopis were going to offer Krsna their presentations because the gopis are eternal
associates of the Lord. Now the gopis were more jubilant because of the news of Krsna's appearance in Vrndavana.
