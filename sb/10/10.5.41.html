atho yathavan na vitarka-gocaram
ceto-manah-karma-vacobhir anjasa
yad-asrayam yena yatah pratiyate
sudurvibhavyam pranatasmi tat-padam

TRANSLATION
Therefore let me surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer my obeisances unto Him, who is
beyond the conception of human speculation, the mind, activities, words and arguments, who is the original cause
of this cosmic manifestation, by whom the entire cosmos is maintained, and by whom we can conceive of its
existence. Let me simply offer my obeisances, for He is beyond my contemplation, speculation and meditation. He
is beyond all of my material activities.
PURPORT
One simply has to realize the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not try to understand
Him by any material means, subtle or gross. Mother Yasoda, being a simple woman, could not find out the real
cause of the vision; therefore, out of maternal affection, she simply offered obeisances unto the Supreme Lord to
protect her child. She could do nothing but offer obeisances to the Lord. It is said, acintyah khalu ye bhava na tams
tarkena yojayet (Mahabharata, Bhisma parva 5.22). One should not try to understand the supreme cause by
argument or reasoning. When we are beset by some problem for which we can find no reason, there is no
alternative than to surrender to the Supreme Lord and offer Him our respectful obeisances. Then our position will
be secure. This was the means adopted in this instance also by mother Yasoda. Whatever happens, the original
cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-karana-karanam). When the immediate cause cannot be
ascertained, let us simply offer our obeisances at the lotus feet of the Lord. Mother Yasoda concluded that the
wonderful things she saw within the mouth of her child were due to Him, although she could not clearly ascertain
the cause. Therefore when a devotee cannot ascertain the cause of suffering, he concludes:
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
(Bhag. 10.14.8)
The devotee accepts that it is due to his own past misdeeds that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has caused
him some small amount of suffering. Thus he offers obeisances to the Lord again and again. Such a devotee is
called mukti-pade sa daya-bhak; that is, he is guaranteed his liberation from this material world. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
We should know that material suffering due to the material body will come and go. Therefore we must tolerate
the suffering and proceed with discharging our duty as ordained by our spiritual master.
