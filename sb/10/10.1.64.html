<h2>Translation</h2>
Once the great saint Narada approached Kamsa and informed him of how the demoniac persons who were a great
burden on the earth were going to be killed. Thus Kamsa was placed into great fear and doubt.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has already been discussed that mother earth implored Lord Brahma to give her relief from the distress created
by the burdensome demons and that Lord Brahma informed her that Lord Krsna Himself was going to appear.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
Whenever there is a burden created by the demons and whenever the innocent devotees are distressed by
demoniac rulers, the Lord appears in due course of time to kill the demons with the assistance of His real
representatives, who are technically called demigods. In the Upanisads it is stated that the demigods are different
parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is the duty of the parts of the body to serve the whole, it is the
duty of Krsna's devotees to serve Krsna as He wants. Krsna's business is to kill the demons, and therefore this
should be a devotee's business also. Because the people of Kali-yuga are fallen, however, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
out of kindness for them, did not bring any weapon to kill them. Rather, by spreading Krsna consciousness, love of
Krsna, He wanted to kill their nefarious, demoniac activities. This is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness
movement. Unless the demoniac activities on the surface of the world are diminished or vanquished, no one can be
happy. The program for the conditioned soul is fully described in Bhagavad-gita, and one simply has to follow
these instructions to become happy. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore prescribed:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
Let people chant the Hare Krsna mantra constantly. Then their demoniac tendencies will be killed, and they will
become first-class devotees, happy in this life and in the next.
