<h2>Text</h2>
etat kamsaya bhagavan
chasamsabhyetya naradah
bhumer bharayamananam
daityanam ca vadhodyamam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--all these words about the Yadu family and Vrsni family; kamsaya--unto King Kamsa; bhagavan--the most
powerful representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sasamsa--informed (Kamsa, who was in doubt);
abhyetya--after approaching him; naradah--the great sage Narada; bhumeh--on the surface of the earth;
bharayamananam--of those who were a burden; daityanam ca--and of the demons; vadha-udyamam--the endeavor
to kill.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once the great saint Narada approached Kamsa and informed him of how the demoniac persons who were a great
burden on the earth were going to be killed. Thus Kamsa was placed into great fear and doubt.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has already been discussed that mother earth implored Lord Brahma to give her relief from the distress created
by the burdensome demons and that Lord Brahma informed her that Lord Krsna Himself was going to appear.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
Whenever there is a burden created by the demons and whenever the innocent devotees are distressed by
demoniac rulers, the Lord appears in due course of time to kill the demons with the assistance of His real
representatives, who are technically called demigods. In the Upanisads it is stated that the demigods are different
parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is the duty of the parts of the body to serve the whole, it is the
duty of Krsna's devotees to serve Krsna as He wants. Krsna's business is to kill the demons, and therefore this
should be a devotee's business also. Because the people of Kali-yuga are fallen, however, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
out of kindness for them, did not bring any weapon to kill them. Rather, by spreading Krsna consciousness, love of
Krsna, He wanted to kill their nefarious, demoniac activities. This is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness
movement. Unless the demoniac activities on the surface of the world are diminished or vanquished, no one can be
happy. The program for the conditioned soul is fully described in Bhagavad-gita, and one simply has to follow
these instructions to become happy. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore prescribed:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
Let people chant the Hare Krsna mantra constantly. Then their demoniac tendencies will be killed, and they will
become first-class devotees, happy in this life and in the next.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After the departure of the great saint Narada, Kamsa thought that all the members of the Yadu dynasty were
demigods and that any of the children born from the womb of Devaki might be Visnu. Fearing his death, Kamsa
arrested Vasudeva and Devaki and chained them with iron shackles. Suspecting each of the children to be Visnu,
Kamsa killed them one after another because of the prophecy that Visnu would kill him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his notes on this verse, has mentioned how Narada Muni gave Kamsa this information.
This incident is described in the Hari-vamsa. Narada Muni went to see Kamsa by providence, and Kamsa received
him very well. Narada, therefore, informed him that any one of the sons of Devaki might be Visnu. Because Visnu
was to kill him, Kamsa should not spare any of Devaki's children, Narada Muni advised. Narada's intention was
that Kamsa, by killing the children, would increase his sinful activities so that Krsna would soon appear to kill him.
Upon receiving the instructions of Narada Muni, Kamsa killed all the children of Devaki one after another.
The word ajana-sankaya indicates that Lord Visnu never takes birth (ajana) and that He therefore appeared as
Krsna, taking birth just like a human being (manusim tanum asritam). Kamsa attempted to kill all the babies born
of Devaki and Vasudeva, although he knew that if Visnu were born, He would not be killed. Actually it came to
pass that when Visnu appeared as Krsna, Kamsa could not kill Him; rather, as foretold, it was He who killed
Kamsa. One should know in truth how Krsna, who takes His birth transcendentally, acts to kill the demons but is
never killed. When one perfectly understands Krsna in this way, through the medium of sastra, one becomes
immortal. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body,
take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
