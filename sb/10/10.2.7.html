The cows, the bulls and the calves were thoroughly smeared with a mixture of turmeric and oil, mixed with
varieties of minerals. Their heads were bedecked with peacock feathers, and they were garlanded and covered with
cloth and golden ornaments.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has instructed in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisyakarma-
svabhavajam: "Farming, cow protection and trade are the qualities of work for the vaisyas." Nanda Maharaja
belonged to the vaisya community, the agriculturalist community. How to protect the cows and how rich this
community was are explained in these verses. We can hardly imagine that cows, bulls and calves could be cared for
so nicely and decorated so well with cloths and valuable golden ornaments. How happy they were. As described
elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, during Maharaja Yudhisthira's time the cows were so happy that they used to muddy
the pasturing ground with milk. This is Indian civilization. Yet in the same place, India, Bharata-varsa, how much
people are suffering by giving up the Vedic way of life and not understanding the teachings of Bhagavad-gita.
