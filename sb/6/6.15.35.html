tava vibhavah khalu bhagavan
jagad-udaya-sthiti-layadini
visva-srjas te 'msamsas
tatra mrsa spardhanti prthag abhimatya
SYNONYMS
tava--Your; vibhavah--opulences; khalu--indeed; bhagavan--O Supreme Personality of Godhead; jagat--
of the cosmic manifestation; udaya--the creation; sthiti--maintenance; laya-adini--dissolution and so on;
visva-srjah--the creators of the manifested world; te--they; amsa-amsah--parts of Your plenary portion;
tatra--in that; mrsa--in vain; spardhanti--rival one another; prthak--of separateness; abhimatya--by a false
conception.
TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your
opulences. Since Lord Brahma and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You,
their partial power to create does not make them God [isvara]. Their consciousness of themselves as
separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige. It is not valid.
PURPORT
A devotee who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord knows very well that the creative
energy of the living entities, from Lord Brahma down to the small ant, exists because the living entities are
part and parcel of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says, mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah
sanatanah: "The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts." The living
entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire. Because they are
part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity.
The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern
facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products. The first
consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme
Lord, who says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "From Me comes
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the
core of every living entity's heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative
faculties comes from Him. Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like
airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists. Before the airplane was created, its
ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the
manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators.
Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles. The ingredients for these cars are
supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied
by the Lord. Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem
of what to do with their ingredients. The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of
Godhead. Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and
later the creation again becomes a problem. Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the
act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is rightly stated herein that
the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord,
not to the living entities.
