kecit kevalaya bhaktya
vasudeva-parayanah
agham dhunvanti kartsnyena
niharam iva bhaskarah
SYNONYMS
kecit--some people; kevalaya bhaktya--by executing unalloyed devotional service; vasudeva--to Lord
Krsna, the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead; parayanah--completely attached (only to such
service, without dependence on austerity, penance, cultivation of knowledge or pious activities); agham--
all kinds of sinful reactions; dhunvanti--destroy; kartsnyena--completely (with no possibility that sinful
desires will revive); niharam--fog; iva--like; bhaskarah--the sun.
TRANSLATION
Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the
weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging
devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.
PURPORT
In the previous verse Sukadeva Gosvami gave the example that the dried leaves of creepers beneath a
bamboo tree may be completely burnt to ashes by a fire, although the creepers may sprout again because
the root is still in the ground. Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a
person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that
his sinful desires will reappear. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.4):
sreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho
klisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
Speculators who undergo great labor to gain a meticulous understanding of the material world by
distinguishing between sinful and pious activities, but who are not situated in devotional service, are
prone to material activities. They may fall down and become implicated in fruitive activities. If one
becomes attached to devotional service, however, his desires for material enjoyment are automatically
vanquished without separate endeavor. Bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: if one is advanced in
Krsna consciousness, material activities, both sinful and pious, automatically become distasteful to him.
That is the test of Krsna consciousness. Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance
because a living entity, as an eternal servant of Krsna, has no need to act for his personal sense
gratification. Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes
his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy Krsna. This
process of bhakti, devotional service to Krsna (vasudeva-parayana), relieves one from the reactions of all
activities.
Since Maharaja Pariksit was a great devotee. the answers of his guru, Sukadeva Gosvami, concerning
karma-kanda and jnana-kanda could not satisfy him. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, knowing very well the
heart of his disciple, explained the transcendental bliss of devotional service. The word kecit, which is
used in this verse, means. "a few people but not all." Not everyone can become Krsna conscious. As Krsna
explains in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." Practically no one understands Krsna as He is, for Krsna
cannot be understood through pious activities or attainment of the most elevated speculative knowledge.
Actually the highest knowledge consists of understanding Krsna. Unintelligent men who do not
understand Krsna are grossly puffed up, thinking that they are liberated or have themselves become Krsna
or Narayana. This is ignorance.
To indicate the purity of bhakti, devotional service, Srila Rupa Gosvami says in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
(1.1.11):
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." Srila Rupa Gosvami further explains that bhakti is klesaghni subhada, which
means if one takes to devotional service, all kinds of unnecessary labor and material distress cease entirely
and one achieves all good fortune. Bhakti is so powerful that it is also said to be moksa-laghutakrt; in
other words, it minimizes the importance of liberation.
Nondevotees must undergo material hardships because they are prone to commit sinful fruitive
activities. The desire to commit sinful actions continues in their hearts due to ignorance. These sinful
actions are divided into three categories--pataka, maha-pataka and atipataka--and also into two divisions;
prarabdha and aprarabdha. Prarabdha refers to sinful reactions from which one is suffering at the present,
and aprarabdha refers to sources of potential suffering. When the seeds (bija) of sinful reactions have not
yet fructified, the reactions are called aprarabdha. These seeds of sinful action are unseen, but they are
unlimited, and no one can trace when they were first planted. Because of prarabdha, sinful reactions that
have already fructified, one is seen to have taken birth in a low family or to be suffering from other
miseries.
When one takes to devotional service, however, all phases of sinful life, including prarabdha,
aprarabdha and bija, are vanquished. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.19) Lord Krsna tells Uddhava:
yathagnih susamrddharcih
karoty edhamsi bhasmasat
tatha mad-visaya bhaktir
uddhavainamsi krtsnasah
"My dear Uddhava, devotional service in relationship with Me is like a blazing fire that can burn to
ashes all the fuel of sinful activities supplied to it." How devotional service vanquishes the reactions of
sinful life is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.6) in a verse spoken during Lord Kapiladeva's
instructions to His mother, Devahuti. Devahuti said:
yan-namadheya-sravananukirtanad
yat-prahvanad yat-smaranad api kvacit
svado 'pi sadyah savanaya kalpate
kutah punas te bhagavan nu darsanat
"My dear Lord, if even a person born in a family of dog-eaters hears and repeats the chanting of Your
glories, offers respects to You and remembers You, he is immediately greater than a brahmana and is
therefore eligible to perform sacrifices. Therefore, what is to be said of one who has seen You directly?"
In the Padma purana there is a statement that persons whose hearts are always attached to the
devotional service of Lord Visnu are immediately released from all the reactions of sinful life. These
reactions generally exist in four phases. Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are
in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current. All such reactions are immediately
nullified by devotional service. When devotional service is present in one's heart, desires to perform sinful
activities have no place there. Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one's
constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully Krsna conscious he realizes that
he is God's eternal servant.
In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami comments that bhakti may be divided into two divisions: (1) santata,
devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) kadacitki, devotional service that
does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened. Incessantly flowing devotional service (santata)
may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2)
spontaneous devotional service. Intermittent devotional service (kadacitki) may be divided into three
categories: (1) ragabhasamayi, devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) ragabhasa-sunyasvarupa-
bhuta, devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional
position of serving, and (3) abhasa-rupa, a slight glimpse of devotional service. As for atonement, if one
has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo prayascitta, atonement, are
superseded. Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and,
above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in kadacitki. Even in the
stage of abhasa-rupa bhakti, all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished. Srila Jiva Gosvami
expresses the opinion that the word kartsnyena means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful
actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by abhasa-rupa bhakti. The example of bhaskara,
the sun, is most appropriate. The abhasa feature of bhakti is compared to twilight, and the accumulation
of one's sinful activities is compared to fog. Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do
no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears. Similarly, if one has even
a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished.
