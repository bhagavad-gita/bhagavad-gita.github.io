<h2>Translation</h2>
O transcendental Lord, who are situated in the topmost planet of the spiritual world, Your two lotus feet
are always massaged by a multitude of the best devotees with their lotus-bud hands. You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, complete in six opulences. You are the supreme person mentioned in the Purusasukta
prayers. You are the most perfect, self-realized master of all mystic power. Let me offer my
respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that the Absolute Truth is one, but is manifested in different features as Brahman, Paramatma
and Bhagavan. The previous verses described the Brahman and Paramatma features of the Absolute Truth.
Now this prayer is offered in bhakti-yoga to the Absolute Supreme Person. The words used in this regard
are sakala-satvata-parivrdha. The word satvata means "devotees," and sakala means "all together." The
devotees, who also have lotus feet, serve the lotus feet of the Lord with their lotus hands. The devotees
may sometimes not be competent to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is addressed
as parama-paramesthin. He is the Supreme Person, yet He is very kind to the devotees. No one is
competent to serve the Lord, but even if a devotee is not competent, the merciful Lord accepts the humble
attempt of the devotee.
