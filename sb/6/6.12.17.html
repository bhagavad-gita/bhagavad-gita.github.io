<h2>Text</h2>
angira uvaca
api te 'namayam svasti
prakrtinam tathatmanah
yatha prakrtibhir guptah
puman raja ca saptabhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
angirah uvaca--the great sage Angira said; api--whether; te--of you; anamayam--health; svasti--
auspiciousness; prakrtinam--of your royal elements (associates and paraphernalia); tatha--as well as;
atmanah--of your own body, mind and soul; yatha--like; prakrtibhih--by the elements of material nature;
guptah--protected; puman--the living being; raja--the king; ca--also; saptabhih--by seven.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Angira said: My dear King, I hope that your body and mind and your royal associates and
paraphernalia are well. When the seven properties of material nature [the total material energy, the ego
and the five objects of sense gratification] are in proper order, the living entity within the material
elements is happy. Without these seven elements one cannot exist. Similarly, a king is always protected by
seven elements--his instructor (svami or guru), his ministers, his kingdom, his fort, his treasury, his royal
order and his friends.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As it is quoted by Sridhara Svami in his Bhagavatam commentary:
svamy-amatyau janapada
durga-dravina-sancayah
dando mitram ca tasyaitah
sapta-prakrtayo matah
A king is not alone. He first has his spiritual master, the supreme guide. Then come his ministers, his
kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies. If these
seven are properly maintained, the king is happy. Similarly, as explained in Bhagavad-gita (dehino 'smin
yatha dehe), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the mahat-tattva, ego and pancatanmatra,
the five objects of sense gratification. When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is
in a mood of pleasure. Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be
happy. Therefore the great sage Angira Rsi inquired about the King's personal health and the good fortune
of his seven associates. When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not
only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants.
All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy.
