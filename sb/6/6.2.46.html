<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
natah param karma-nibandha-krntanam
mumuksatam tirtha-padanukirtanat
na yat punah karmasu sajjate mano
rajas-tamobhyam kalilam tato 'nyatha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; atah--therefore; param--better means; karma-nibandha--the obligation to suffer or undergo
tribulations as a result of fruitive activities; krntanam--that which can completely cut off; mumuksatam--
of persons desiring to get out of the clutches of material bondage; tirtha-pada--about the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand; anukirtanat--than constantly chanting
under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master; na--not; yat--because; punah--again; karmasu--in
fruitive activities; sajjate--becomes attached; manah--the mind; rajah-tamobhyam--by the modes of
passion and ignorance; kalilam--contaminated; tatah--thereafter; anyatha--by any other means.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and
glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the
holy places stand. One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement,
speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one
takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of
nature, namely passion and ignorance.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many karmis, jnanis and yogis
become attached to material activities again. Many so-called svamis and yogis give up material activities as
false (jagan mithya), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals
and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public. Sometimes they participate in
politics, although still falsely declaring themselves sannyasis, members of the renounced order. The
perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to
devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh: chanting and hearing the glories of the
Lord. The Krsna consciousness movement has actually proved this. In the Western countries, many young
boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up,
abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as
they joined the Krsna consciousness movement. In other words, this process is the perfect method of
atonement for actions performed in rajah and tamah (passion and ignorance). As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.19):
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitam sattve prasidati
As a result of rajah and tamah, one becomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the
process of chanting and hearing, one comes to the platform of goodness and becomes happy. As he
advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate hrdaya-granthis
chidyante sarva-samsayah). Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces.
