mayy ananta-gune 'nante
gunato guna-vigrahah
yadasit tata evadyah
svayambhuh samabhud ajah
SYNONYMS
mayi--in Me; ananta-gune--possessing unlimited potency; anante--unlimited; gunatah--from My potency
known as maya; guna-vigrahah--the universe, which is a result of the modes of nature; yada--when; asit--
it came into existence; tatah--therein; eva--indeed; adyah--the first living being; svayambhuh--Lord
Brahma; samabhut--was born; ajah--although not from a material mother.
TRANSLATION
I am the reservoir of unlimited potency, and therefore I am known as unlimited or all-pervading. From
My material energy the cosmic manifestation appeared within Me, and in this universal manifestation
appeared the chief being, Lord Brahma, who is your source and is not born of a material mother.
PURPORT
This is a description of the history of the universal creation. The first cause is the Lord Himself, the
Supreme Person. From Him, Brahma is created, and Brahma takes charge of the affairs of the universe.
The universal affairs of the material creation depend upon the material energy of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is therefore the cause of the material creation. The entire cosmic manifestation is
described herein as guna-vigrahah, the form of the Lord's qualities. From the cosmic universal form, the
first creation is Lord Brahma, who is the cause of all living entities. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya
describes the unlimited attributes of the Lord:
praty-ekaso gunanam tu
nihsimatvam udiryate
tadanantyam tu gunatas
te cananta hi sankhyaya
ato 'nanta-guno visnur
gunato 'nanta eva ca
Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate: the Lord has innumerable potencies, all of which are unlimited.
Therefore the Lord Himself and all His qualities, forms, pastimes and paraphernalia are also unlimited.
Because Lord Visnu has unlimited attributes, He is known as Ananta.

mene khilam ivatmanam

tapo 'tapyata darunam

SYNONYMS
sah--that Lord Brahma; vai--indeed; yada--when; maha-devah--the chief of all the demigods; mama--My;
virya-upabrmhitah--being increased by the potency; mene--thought; khilam--incapable; iva--as if;
atmanam--himself; udyatah--attempting; svarga-karmani--in the creation of the universal affairs; atha--at
that time; me--by Me; abhihitah--advised; devah--that Lord Brahma; tapah--austerity; atapyata--
performed; darunam--extremely difficult; nava--nine; visva-srjah--important personalities to create the
universe; yusman--all of you; yena--by whom; adau--in the beginning; asrjat--created; vibhuh--the great.
TRANSLATION
When the chief lord of the universe, Lord Brahma [Svayambhu], having been inspired by My energy,
was attempting to create, he thought himself incapable. Therefore I gave him advice, and in accordance
with My instructions he underwent extremely difficult austerities. Because of these austerities, the great
Lord Brahma was able to create nine personalities, including you, to help him in the functions of creation.
PURPORT
Nothing is possible without tapasya. Lord Brahma, however, was empowered to create this entire
universe because of his austerities. The more we engage in austerities, the more we become powerful by
the grace of the Lord. Therefore Rsabhadeva advised His sons, tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed: "One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service.
By such activity, one's heart is purified." (Bhag. 5.5.1) In our material existence we are impure, and
therefore we cannot do anything wonderful, but if we purify our existence by tapasya, we can do
wonderful things by the grace of the Lord. Therefore tapasya is very important, as stressed in this verse.
