<h2>Translation</h2>
In this very great narrative there is glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, there
are statements about the exaltedness of devotional service, there are descriptions of devotees like Indra
and Vrtrasura, and there are statements about King Indra's release from sinful life and about his victory in
fighting the demons. By understanding this incident, one is relieved of all sinful reactions. Therefore the
learned are always advised to read this narration. If one does so, one will become expert in the activities of
the senses, his opulence will increase, and his reputation will become widespread. One will also be
relieved of all sinful reactions, he will conquer all his enemies, and the duration of his life will increase.
Because this narration is auspicious in all respects, learned scholars regularly hear and repeat it on every
festival day.
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Indra Afflicted by Sinful Reaction."
Chapter Fourteen
King Citraketu's Lamentation
In this Fourteenth Chapter, Pariksit Maharaja asks his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, how such a
demon as Vrtrasura could become an exalted devotee. In this connection the previous life of Vrtrasura is
discussed. This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the
death of his son.
Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among
human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence.
Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the
association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination. And among many millions of
such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Narayana. Therefore such devotees are
extremely rare. Since bhakti, devotional service, is not ordinary, Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that an
asura could rise to the exalted position of a devotee. Being doubtful, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from
Sukadeva Gosvami, who then described Vrtrasura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the
King of Surasena.
Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Angira. When Angira inquired
from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the
great sage, the King's first wife, Krtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and
lamentation. Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy. The
co-wives of Krtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child. Citraketu
was overwhelmed by shock at his son's death. Then Narada Muni and Angira went to see him.
