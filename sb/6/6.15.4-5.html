<h2>Translation</h2>
One time while King Citraketu was traveling in outer space on a brilliantly effulgent airplane given to
him by Lord Visnu, he saw Lord Siva, surrounded by Siddhas and Caranas. Lord Siva was sitting in an
assembly of great saintly persons and embracing Parvati on his lap with his arm. Citraketu laughed loudly
and spoke, within the hearing of Parvati.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection,
bhaktim bhutim harir dattva
sva-vicchedanubhutaye
devyah sapena vrtratvam
nitva tam svantike 'nayat
The purport is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to bring Citraketu to Vaikunthaloka as
soon as possible. The Lord's plan was that Citraketu be cursed by Parvati to become Vrtrasura so that in
his next life he could quickly return home, back to Godhead. There have been many instances in which a
devotee acting as a demon has been brought to the kingdom of God by the mercy of the Lord. For Parvati
to be embraced by Lord Siva was natural in a relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing
extraordinary for Citraketu to see. Nonetheless, Citraketu laughed loudly to see Lord Siva in that
situation, even though he should not have done so. Thus he was eventually cursed, and this curse was the
cause of his returning home, back to Godhead.
