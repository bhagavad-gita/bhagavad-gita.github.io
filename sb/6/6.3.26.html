<h2>Translation</h2>
When one's consciousness is completely purified of the contamination of material existence, gross and
subtle, without being agitated as in the working and dreaming states, and when the mind is not dissolved
as in susupti, deep sleep, one comes to the platform of trance. Then one's material vision and the
memories of the mind, which manifests names and forms, are vanquished. Only in such a trance is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead revealed. Thus let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is seen in that uncontaminated, transcendental state.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are two stages of God realization. One is called sujneyam, or very easily understood (generally by
mental speculation), and the other is called durjneyam, understood only with difficulty. Paramatma
realization and Brahman realization are considered sujneyam, but realization of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is durjneyam. As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of
Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind--thinking, feeling and willing--or, in other words,
when mental speculation stops. This transcendental realization is above susupti, deep sleep. In our gross
conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle
stage we perceive the world in dreams. The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in
a subtle form. Above gross experience and dreams is susupti, deep sleep, and when one comes to the
completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, visuddha-sattva, or vasudevasattva,
in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.
Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: as long as one is situated in duality, on the sensual
platform, gross or subtle, realization of the original Personality of Godhead is impossible. Sevonmukhe hi
jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: but when one engages his senses in the service of the Lord--
specifically, when one engages the tongue in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and tasting only Krsna
prasada with a spirit of service--the Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed. This is indicated in this
verse by the word suci-sadmane. Suci means purified. By the spirit of rendering service with one's senses,
one's entire existence becomes suci-sadma, the platform of uncontaminated purity. Daksa therefore offers
his respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is revealed on the platform of
suci-sadma. In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following prayer by Lord
Brahma from the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.6): tathapi bhuman mahimagunasya te viboddhum arhaty
amalantar-atmabhih. "One whose heart has become completely purified, my Lord, can understand the
transcendental qualities of Your Lordship and can understand the greatness of Your activities."
