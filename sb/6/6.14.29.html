<h2>Text</h2>
tatah katipayahobhir
vidyayeddha-mano-gatih
jagama deva-devasya
sesasya caranantikam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--thereafter; katipaya-ahobhih--within a few days; vidyaya--by the spiritual mantra; iddha-manahgatih--
the course of his mind being enlightened; jagama--went; deva-devasya--of the master of all other
lords or demigods; sesasya--Lord Sesa; carana-antikam--to the shelter of the lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, within a very few days, by the influence of the mantra that Citraketu had practiced, his mind
became increasingly enlightened in spiritual progress, and he attained shelter at the lotus feet of
Anantadeva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee's ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets
in the spiritual sky. As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material
opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does
the Supreme Lord award them. When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord,
his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual. For example, if a devotee spends
money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual
(nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate). A devotee's mind is never diverted to the
material side of the temple. The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are
spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself. The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of
devotional service. Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual. Consequently a
devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement. This opulence is an aid to help
the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom. Thus Maharaja Citraketu remained in material
opulence as a vidyadhara-pati, master of the Vidyadharas, and by executing devotional service he became
perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of
Lord Sesa, Ananta.
A karmi's material opulence and a devotee's material opulence are not on the same level. Srila
Madhvacarya comments in this way:
anyantaryaminam visnum
upasyanya-samipagah
bhaved yogyataya tasya
padam va prapnuyan narah
By worshiping Lord Visnu one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Visnu
for any material profit. Instead he serves Lord Visnu without material desires and is therefore ultimately
transferred to the spiritual kingdom. In this regard, Srila Viraraghava Acarya comments, yathesta-gatir ity
arthah: by worshiping Visnu, a devotee can get whatever he likes. Maharaja Citraketu wanted only to
return home, back to Godhead, and therefore he achieved success in that way.
