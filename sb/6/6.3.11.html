<h2>Text</h2>
atisthata satam margam
kopam yacchata dipitam
pitra pitamahenapi
justam vah prapitamahaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atisthata--just follow; satam margam--the path of the great saintly personalities; kopam--the anger;
yacchata--subdue; dipitam--which is now awakened; pitra--by the father; pitamahena api--and by the
grandfather; justam--executed; vah--your; prapitamahaih--by the great-grandfathers.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The path of goodness traversed by your father, grandfather and great-grandfathers is that of maintaining
the subjects [prajas], including the men, animals and trees. That is the path you should follow.
Unnecessary anger is contrary to your duty. Therefore I request you to control your anger.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the words pitra pitamahenapi justam vah prapitamahaih depict an honest royal family, consisting
of the kings, their father, their grandfather and their great-grandfathers. Such a royal family has a
prestigious position because it maintains the citizens, or prajas. The word praja refers to one who has
taken birth within the jurisdiction of the government. The exalted royal families were conscious that all
living beings, whether human, animal or lower than animal, should be given protection. The modern
democratic system cannot be exalted in this way because the leaders elected strive only for power and
have no sense of responsibility. In a monarchy, a king with a prestigious position follows the great deeds
of his forefathers. Thus Soma, the king of the moon, here reminds the Pracetas about the glories of their
father, grandfather and great-grandfathers.
