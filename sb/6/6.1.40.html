<h2>Text</h2>
yamaduta ucuh
veda-pranihito dharmo
hy adharmas tad-viparyayah
vedo narayanah saksat
svayambhur iti susruma
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yamadutah ucuh--the order carriers of Yamaraja said; veda--by the four Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Rg and
Atharva); pranihitah--prescribed; dharmah--religious principles; hi--indeed; adharmah--irreligious
principles; tat-viparyayah--the opposite of that (that which is not supported by Vedic injunctions);
vedah--the Vedas, books of knowledge; narayanah saksat--directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead
(being the words of Narayana); svayam-bhuh--self-born, self-sufficient (appearing only from the breath of
Narayana and not being learned from anyone else); iti--thus; susruma--we have heard.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Yamadutas replied: That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious
principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion. The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Narayana, and are self-born. This we have heard from Yamaraja.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The servants of Yamaraja replied quite properly. They did not manufacture principles of religion or
irreligion. Instead, they explained what they had heard from the authority Yamaraja. Mahajano yena gatah
sa panthah: one should follow the mahajana, the authorized person. Yamaraja is one of twelve authorities.
Therefore the servants of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, replied with perfect clarity when they said susruma
("we have heard"). The members of modern civilization manufacture defective religious principles
through speculative concoction. This is not dharma. They do not know what is dharma and what is
adharma. Therefore, as stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, dharmah projjhita-kaitavo 'tra:
dharma not supported by the Vedas is rejected from srimad-bhagavata-dharma. Bhagavata-dharma
comprises only that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavata-dharma is sarvadharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: one must accept the authority of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and surrender to Him and whatever He says. That is dharma. Arjuna, for example, thinking
that violence was adharma, was declining to fight, but Krsna urged him to fight. Arjuna abided by the
orders of Krsna, and therefore he is actually a dharmi because the order of Krsna is dharma. Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: "The real purpose of veda, knowledge, is to
know Me." One who knows Krsna perfectly is liberated. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One who
understands Krsna and abides by His order is a candidate for returning home, back to Godhead. It may be
concluded that dharma, religion, refers to that which is ordered in the Vedas, and adharma, irreligion,
refers to that which is not supported in the Vedas.
Dharma is not actually manufactured by Narayana. As stated in the Vedas, asya mahato bhutasya
nisvasitam etad yad rg-vedah iti: the injunctions of dharma emanate from the breathing of Narayana, the
supreme living entity. Narayana exists eternally and breathes eternally, and therefore dharma, the
injunctions of Narayana, also exist eternally. Srila Madhvacarya, the original acarya for those who belong
to the Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya, says:
vedanam prathamo vakta
harir eva yato vibhuh
ato visnv-atmaka veda
ity ahur veda-vadinah
The transcendental words of the Vedas emanated from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the Vedic principles should be understood to be Vaisnava principles because Visnu is
the origin of the Vedas. The Vedas contain nothing besides the instructions of Visnu, and one who follows
the Vedic principles is a Vaisnava. The Vaisnava is not a member of a manufactured community of this
material world. A Vaisnava is a real knower of the Vedas, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (vedais ca sarvair
aham eva vedyah).
