<h2>Translation</h2>
By His own potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has multifarious potencies, appeared in
the form of a dwarf as Urukrama, the twelfth son of Aditi. In the womb of His wife, whose name was Kirti,
He begot one son, named Brhatsloka, who had many sons, headed by Saubhaga.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.6):
ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya
"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of
all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." When the
Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates, He does not need any help from the external energy, for He
appears as He is by His own potency. The spiritual potency is also called maya. It is said, ato mayamayam
visnum pravadanti manisinah: the body accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called
mayamaya. This does not mean that He is formed of the external energy; this maya refers to His internal
potency.
