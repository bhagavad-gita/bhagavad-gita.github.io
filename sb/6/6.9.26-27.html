<h2>Translation</h2>
By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various
transcendental bodies as Vamanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Parasurama, the
incarnation among saints; Nrsimhadeva and Varaha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kurma,
incarnations among aquatics. He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities,
and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Krsna and Lord Rama. By His causeless mercy,
He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons. He is the supreme worshipable Deity
of all living entities. He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies.
Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form [virat-rupa]. In our fearful
condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give
us His protection.

<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is ascertained to be the original cause of
creation. Sridhara Svami, in his commentary Bhavartha-dipika, replies to the idea that prakrti and purusa
are the causes of the cosmic manifestation. As stated herein, param pradhanam purusam visvam anyam:
"He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies. Although different from
this universe, He exists in His universal form [virat 'rupa]." The word prakrti, which is used to indicate
the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word purusa refers to
the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord. Both the prakrti and purusa ultimately enter
the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (prakrtim yanti mamikam).
Although prakrti and purusa superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are
emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of prakrti
and purusa. He is the original cause (sarva-karana-karanam). The Naradiya Purana says:
avikaro 'pi paramah
prakrtis tu vikarini
anupravisya govindah
prakrtis cabhidhiyate
Both the prakrti and purusa, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (gam avisya), the Lord enters the prakrti, and then
the prakrti creates different manifestations. The prakrti is not independent or beyond His energies.
Vasudeva, Lord Sri Krsna, is the original cause of everything. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(10.8):
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who
perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts." In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (2.9.33) the Lord also says, aham evasam evagre: "Only I existed before the creation." This is
confirmed in the Brahmanda Purana as follows:
smrtir avyavadhanena
prakrtitvam iti sthitih
ubhayatmaka-sutitvad
vasudevah parah puman
prakrtih purusas ceti
sabdair eko 'bhidhiyate
To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the purusa and directly as the prakrti. Because both
energies emanate from Lord Vasudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is known as
both prakrti and purusa. Therefore Vasudeva is the cause of everything (sarva-karana-karanam).
