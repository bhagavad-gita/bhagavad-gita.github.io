<h2>Text</h2>
sakrn manah krsna-padaravindayor
nivesitam tad-guna-ragi yair iha
na te yamam pasa-bhrtas ca tad-bhatan
svapne 'pi pasyanti hi cirna-niskrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sakrt--once only; manah--the mind; krsna-pada-aravindayoh--unto the two lotus feet of Lord Krsna;
nivesitam--completely surrendered; tat--of Krsna; guna-ragi--which is somewhat attached to the qualities,
name, fame and paraphernalia; yaih--by whom; iha--in this world; na--not; te--such persons; yamam--
Yamaraja, the superintendent of death; pasa-bhrtah--those who carry ropes (to catch sinful persons); ca--
and; tat--his; bhatan--order carriers; svapne api--even in dreams; pasyanti--see; hi--indeed; cirnaniskrtah--
who have performed the right type of atonement.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although not having fully realized Krsna, persons who have even once surrendered completely unto His
lotus feet and who have become attracted to His name, form, qualities and pastimes are completely freed
of all sinful reactions, for they have thus accepted the true method of atonement. Even in dreams, such
surrendered souls do not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are equipped with ropes to bind the
sinful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." This same principle is described here (sakrn manah krsna-padaravindayoh). If by studying
Bhagavad-gita one decides to surrender to Krsna, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions. It is
also significant that Sukadeva Gosvami, having several times repeated the words vasudeva-parayana and
narayana-parayana, finally says krsna-padaravindayoh. Thus he indicates that Krsna is the origin of both
Narayana and Vasudeva. Even though Narayana and Vasudeva are not different from Krsna, simply by
surrendering to Krsna one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as Narayana, Vasudeva and
Govinda. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram nanyat: "There is no truth superior to
Me." There are many names and forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is the supreme
form (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). Therefore Krsna recommends to neophyte devotees that one should
surrender unto Him only (mam ekam). Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of
Narayana, Vasudeva and Govinda are, Krsna directly says, mam ekam. Herein, this is also supported by
the word krsna-padaravindayoh. Narayana does not speak personally, but Krsna, or Vasudeva, does, as in
Bhagavad-gita for example. Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-gita means to surrender unto
Krsna, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga.
Pariksit Maharaja had inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami how one can be saved from falling into the
various conditions of hellish life. In this verse Sukadeva Gosvami answers that a soul who has surrendered
to Krsna certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence. To say nothing of going there, even in his
dreams he does not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there. In other words, if
one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to Krsna. The
word sakrt is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to Krsna once, he is saved
even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities. Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.30):
api cet su-duracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah
"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be
considered saintly because he is properly situated." If one never for a moment forgets Krsna, he is safe
even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts.
In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (2.40) the Lord also says:
nehabhikrama-naso 'sti
pratyavayo na vidyate
svalpam apy asya dharmasya
trayate mahato bhayat
"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one
from the most dangerous type of fear."
Elsewhere in the Gita (6.40) the Lord says, na hi kalyana-krt kascid durgatim tata gacchati: "one who
performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil." The highest kalyana (auspicious) activity is to
surrender to Krsna. That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life. Srila
Prabodhananda Sarasvati has confirmed this as follows:
kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto Krsna are compared to a snake with its poison fangs
removed (protkhata-damstrayate). Such a snake is no longer to be feared. Of course, one should not
commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to Krsna. However, even if one who has
surrendered to Krsna happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no
longer have a destructive effect. Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of Krsna very tightly and
serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master. Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free
from fear.
