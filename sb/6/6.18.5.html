TRANSLATION
O my Lord, because You are endowed with causeless mercy, all opulences, all prowess and all glories,
strength and transcendental qualities, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of
everyone.
PURPORT
In this verse the words tato 'si bhagavan prabhuh mean "Therefore You are the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the master of everyone." The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all six
opulences in full, and moreover He is extremely kind to His devotee. Although He is full in Himself, He
nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service.
Thus He becomes satisfied. Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His
devotee offers Him patram puspam phalam toyam--a leaf, flower, fruit or water--in devotion. Sometimes
the Lord, as the child of mother Yasoda, requests His devotee for some food, as if He were very hungry.
Sometimes He tells His devotee in a dream that His temple and His garden are now very old and that He
cannot enjoy them very nicely. Thus He requests the devotee to repair them. Sometimes He is buried in
the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him. Sometimes He
requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to
perform this task. Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and
is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees. Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is
extremely confidential. Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on
His devotee for some particular work. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (11.33), where the Lord tells
Arjuna, nimitta-matram bhava savyasacin: "O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight." Lord Krsna
had the competence to win the Battle of Kuruksetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to
fight and become the cause of victory. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was quite competent enough to spread
His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work.
Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord's self-sufficiency is that He
depends on His devotees. This is called His causeless mercy. The devotee who has perceived this causeless
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant.
