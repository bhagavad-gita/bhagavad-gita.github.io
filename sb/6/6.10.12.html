<h2>Text</h2>
avidvan evam atmanam
manyate 'nisam isvaram
bhutaih srjati bhutani
grasate tani taih svayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
avidvan--one who is foolish, without knowledge; evam--thus; atmanam--himself; manyate--considers;
anisam--although totally dependent on others; isvaram--as the supreme controller, independent; bhutaih--
by the living entities; srjati--He (the Lord) creates; bhutani--other living entities; grasate--He devours;
tani--them; taih--by other living beings; svayam--Himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A foolish, senseless person cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although always
dependent, he falsely thinks himself the Supreme. If one thinks, "According to one's previous fruitive
actions, one's material body is created by the father and mother, and the same body is annihilated by
another agent, as another animal is devoured by a tiger," this is not proper understanding. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself creates and devours the living beings through other living beings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the conclusion of the philosophy known as karma-mimamsa, one's karma, or previous
fruitive activity, is the cause of everything, and therefore there is no need to work. Those who arrive at
this conclusion are foolish. When a father creates a child, he does not do so independently; he is induced
to do so by the Supreme Lord. As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Unless one receives dictation from the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who sits within everyone's heart, one cannot be induced to create anything. Therefore the
father and mother are not the creators of the living entity. According to the living entity's karma, fruitive
activities, he is put into the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of the mother.
Then according to the body of the mother and father (yatha-yoni yatha-bijam), the living entity accepts a
body and takes birth to suffer or enjoy. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of one's birth.
Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one's being killed. No one is independent; everyone is
dependent. The true conclusion is that the only independent person is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
