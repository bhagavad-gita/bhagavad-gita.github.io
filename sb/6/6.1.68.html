<h2>Text</h2>
tata enam danda-paneh
sakasam krta-kilbisam
nesyamo 'krta-nirvesam
yatra dandena suddhyati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--therefore; enam--him; danda-paneh--of Yamaraja, who is authorized to punish; sakasam--in the
presence; krta-kilbisam--who has regularly committed all sinful activities; nesyamah--we shall take; akrtanirvesam--
who has not undergone atonement; yatra--where; dandena--by punishment; suddhyati--he will
be purified.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This man Ajamila did not undergo atonement. Therefore because of his sinful life, we must take him
into the presence of Yamaraja for punishment. There, according to the extent of his sinful acts, he will be
punished and thus purified.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Visnudutas had forbidden the Yamadutas to take Ajamila to Yamaraja, and therefore the Yamadutas
explained that taking such a man to Yamaraja was appropriate. Since Ajamila had not undergone
atonement for his sinful acts, he was to be taken to Yamaraja to be purified. When a man commits murder
he becomes sinful, and therefore he also must be killed; otherwise after death he must suffer many sinful
reactions. Similarly, punishment by Yamaraja is a process of purification for the most abominable sinful
persons. Therefore the Yamadutas requested the Visnudutas not to obstruct their taking Ajamila to
Yamaraja.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The History of the Life of Ajamila."
Chapter Two
Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas
In this chapter the messengers from Vaikuntha explain to the Yamadutas the glories of chanting the
holy name of the Lord. The Visnudutas said, "Now impious acts are being performed even in an assembly
of devotees, for a person who is not punishable is going to be punished in the assembly of Yamaraja. The
mass of people are helpless and must depend upon the government for their safety and security, but if the
government takes advantage of this to harm the citizens, where will they go? We see perfectly that
Ajamila should not be punished, although you are attempting to take him to Yamaraja for punishment."
It was due to Ajamila's glorifying the holy name of the Supreme Lord that he was not punishable. The
Visnudutas explained this as follows: "Simply by once chanting the holy name of Narayana, this
brahmana has become free from the reactions of sinful life. Indeed, he has been freed not only from the
sins of this life, but from the sins of many, many thousands of other lives. He has already undergone true
atonement for all his sinful actions. If one atones according to the directions of the sastras, one does not
actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of
such chanting can immediately free one from all sins. Chanting the glories of the Lord's holy name
awakens all good fortune. Therefore there is no doubt that Ajamila, being completely free from all sinful
reactions, should not be punished by Yamaraja."
As they were saying this, the Visnudutas released Ajamila from the ropes of the Yamadutas and left for
their own abode. The brahmana Ajamila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Visnudutas. He
could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of Narayana at the end of his life.
Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune. Having thoroughly understood the
discussion between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned
himself again and again.
Finally, because of his association with the Visnudutas, Ajamila, his original consciousness aroused,
gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation,
always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus the Visnudutas went there, seated him on a
golden throne and took him away to Vaikunthaloka.
In summary, although the sinful Ajamila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord Narayana, even
though chanted in the preliminary stage, namabhasa, was able to give him liberation. Therefore one who
chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted. He is protected even in his
material, conditional life.
