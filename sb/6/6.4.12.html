<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had said that there is a kingdom where there is only one male. The Haryasvas realized the
purport of this statement.] The only enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who observes
everything, everywhere. He is full of six opulences and fully independent of everyone else. He is never
subject to the three modes of material nature, for He is always transcendental to this material creation. If
the members of human society do not understand Him, the Supreme, through their advancement in
knowledge and activities, but simply work very hard like cats and dogs all day and night for temporary
happiness, what will be the benefit of their activities?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narada Muni had mentioned a kingdom where there is only one king with no competitor. The complete
spiritual world, and specifically the cosmic manifestation, has only one proprietor or enjoyer--the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond this material manifestation. The Lord has therefore been
described as turya, existing on the fourth platform. He has also been described as abhava. The word
bhava, which means "takes birth," comes from the word bhu, "to be." As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.19),
bhutva bhutva praliyate: the living entities in the material world must be repeatedly born and destroyed.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is neither bhutva nor praliyate; He is eternal. In other
words, He is not obliged to take birth like human beings or animals, which repeatedly take birth and die
because of ignorance of the soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not subjected to such
changes of body, and one who thinks otherwise is considered a fool (avajananti mam mudha manusim
tanum asritam). Narada Muni advises that human beings not waste their time simply jumping like cats
and monkeys, without real benefit. The duty of the human being is to understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
