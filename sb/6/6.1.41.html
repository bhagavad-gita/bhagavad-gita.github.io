<h2>Text</h2>
yena sva-dhamny ami bhava
rajah-sattva-tamomayah
guna-nama-kriya-rupair
vibhavyante yatha-tatham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yena--by whom (Narayana); sva-dhamni--although in His own place, the spiritual world; ami--all these;
bhavah--manifestations; rajah-sattva-tamah-mayah--created by the three modes of material nature
(passion, goodness and ignorance); guna--qualities; nama--names; kriya--activities; rupaih--and with
forms; vibhavyante--are variously manifested; yatha-tatham--exactly to the right point.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The supreme cause of all causes, Narayana, is situated in His own abode in the spiritual world, but
nevertheless He controls the entire cosmic manifestation according to the three modes of material nature--
sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. In this way all living entities are awarded different qualities,
different names [such as brahmana, ksatriya and vaisya], different duties according to the varnasrama
institution, and different forms. Thus Narayana is the cause of the entire cosmic manifestation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedas inform us:
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8)
Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is almighty, omnipotent. He has multifarious energies,
and therefore He is able to remain in His own abode and without endeavor supervise and manipulate the
entire cosmic manifestation through the interaction of the three modes of material nature--sattva-guna,
rajo-guna and tamo-guna. These interactions create different forms, bodies, activities and changes, which
all occur perfectly. Because the Lord is perfect, everything works as if He were directly supervising and
taking part in it. Atheistic men, however, being covered by the three modes of material nature, cannot see
Narayana to be the supreme cause behind all activities. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.13):
tribhir gunamayair bhavair
ebhih sarvam idam jagat
mohitam nabhijanati
mam ebhyah param avyayam
"Deluded by the three modes, the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and
inexhaustible." Because unintelligent agnostics are mohita, illusioned by the three modes of material
nature, they cannot understand that Narayana, Krsna, is the supreme cause of all activities. As stated in
Brahma-samhita (5.1):
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes."
