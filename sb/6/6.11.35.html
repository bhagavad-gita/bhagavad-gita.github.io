vrtrasya dehan niskrantam
atma-jyotir arindama
pasyatam sarva-devanam
alokam samapadyata
SYNONYMS
vrtrasya--of Vrtrasura; dehat--from the body; niskrantam--coming out; atma-jyotih--the spirit soul,
which was as brilliant as the effulgence of Brahman; arim-dama--O King Pariksit, subduer of enemies;
pasyatam--were watching; sarva-devanam--while all the demigods; alokam--the supreme abode, filled with
the Brahman effulgence; samapadyata--achieved.
TRANSLATION
O King Pariksit, subduer of enemies, the living spark then came forth from Vrtrasura's body and
returned home, back to Godhead. While all the demigods looked on, he entered the transcendental world
to become an associate of Lord Sankarsana.
PURPORT
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that Indra, not Vrtrasura, was actually killed. He says that
when Vrtrasura swallowed King Indra and his carrier, the elephant, he thought, "Now I have killed Indra,
and therefore there is no more need of fighting. Now let me return home, back to Godhead." Thus he
stopped all his bodily activities and became situated in trance. Taking advantage of the silence of
Vrtrasura's body, Indra pierced the demon's abdomen, and because of Vrtrasura's trance, Indra was able to
come out. Now, Vrtrasura was in yoga-samadhi, and therefore although King Indra wanted to cut his days
to cut it to pieces. Actually it was the body left by Vrtrasura that was cut to pieces by Indra; Vrtrasura
himself was not killed. In his original consciousness, Vrtrasura returned home, back to Godhead, to
become an associate of Lord Sankarsana. Here the word alokam means the transcendental world,
Vaikunthaloka, where Sankarsana eternally resides.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Vrtrasura's Glorious Death."
Chapter Thirteen
King Indra Afflicted by Sinful Reaction
This chapter describes Indra's fear at having killed a brahmana (Vrtrasura), and it also describes how he
fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Visnu.
When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vrtrasura, he refused because Vrtrasura was a brahmana.
The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the
Narayana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Narayana. Even by a glimpse of
the chanting of Narayana's name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow
or a brahmana. The demigods advised Indra to perform an asvamedha sacrifice, by which Narayana would
be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the
entire universe.
Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vrtrasura, but when Vrtrasura was
killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vrtrasura's position. This is the nature of a great
personality. Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he
acquires it illegally. Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing
a brahmana. Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and
there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins. He went to Manasa-sarovara, and there, under the
protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years. During this time, Nahusa
reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra. Unfortunately, however, he was attracted
by the beauty of Indra's wife, Sacidevi, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a
serpent in his next life. Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted brahmanas and
saints. In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a brahmana.
