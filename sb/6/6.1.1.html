<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit said: O my lord, O Sukadeva Gosvami, you have already described [in the Second
Canto] the path of liberation [nivrtti-marga]. By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to
the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with
Lord Brahma. Thus one's repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since Maharaja Pariksit was a Vaisnava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of
the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned
souls from the clutches of maya and take them back home, back to Godhead. Therefore he reminded his
spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, about the nivrtti-marga, or path of liberation, which he had
described in the Second Canto. Maharaja Pariksit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met
Sukadeva Gosvami, inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation at that crucial time.
Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:
variyan esa te prasnah
krto loka-hitam nrpa
atmavit-sammatah pumsam
srotavyadisu yah parah
"My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people. The answer
to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists."
(Bhag. 2.1.1)
Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path
of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions. This is the symptom of
a Vaisnava. Vancha-kalpa-tarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vaisnava is an ocean of mercy. Paraduhkha-
duhkhi: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja, being
compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Sukadeva Gosvami
continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. The word asamsrti is very important in this connection. Samsrti refers to continuing on the
path of birth and death. Asamsrti, on the contrary, refers to nivrtti-marga, or the path of liberation, by
which one's birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure
devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately
returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti).
Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation
for the conditioned soul.
According to the opinion of the acaryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first
performing karma-yoga and then jnana-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can
be liberated. Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or jnana-yoga.
Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate
with no assets in jnana-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to
bhakti-yoga. Mam evaisyasy asamsayah. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.7) that by the process of bhaktiyoga
one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world. Yogis, however, instead of
going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they
ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahma lives, as indicated here by the word brahmana. At the
time of dissolution, Lord Brahma, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the
spiritual world. This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows:
brahmana saha te sarve
samprapte pratisancare
parasyante krtatmanah
pravisanti param padam
"Because of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly
back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahma."
