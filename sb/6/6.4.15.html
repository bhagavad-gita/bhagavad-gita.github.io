<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tat-sanga-bhramsitaisvaryam
samsarantam kubharyavat
tad-gatir abudhasyeha
kim asat-karmabhir bhavet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat-sanga--by association with the prostitute of intelligence; bhramsita--taken away; aisvaryam--the
opulence of independence; samsarantam--undergoing the material way of life; ku-bharya-vat--exactly like
a person who has a polluted wife; tat-gatih--the movements of the polluted intelligence; abudhasya--of
one who does not know; iha--in this world; kim asat-karmabhih bhavet--what can be the benefit of
performing temporary fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had also spoken of a man who is the husband of the prostitute. The Haryasvas
understood this as follows.] If one becomes the husband of a prostitute, he loses all independence.
Similarly, if a living entity has polluted intelligence, he prolongs his materialistic life. Frustrated by
material nature, he must follow the movements of the intelligence, which brings various conditions of
happiness and distress. If one performs fruitive activities under such conditions, what will be the benefit?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Polluted intelligence has been compared to a prostitute. One who has not purified his intelligence is said
to be controlled by that prostitute. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.41), vyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kurunandana:
those who are actually serious are conducted by one kind of intelligence, namely, intelligence in
Krsna consciousness. Bahu-sakha hy anantas ca buddhayo 'vyavasayinam: one who is not fixed in proper
intelligence discovers many modes of life. Thus involved in material activities, he is exposed to the
different modes of material nature and subjected to varieties of so-called happiness and distress. If a man
becomes the husband of a prostitute, he cannot be happy, and similarly one who follows the dictations of
material intelligence and material consciousness will never be happy.
One must judiciously understand the activities of material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27):
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to
be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." Although one follows the dictations
of material nature, he happily thinks himself the master or husband of material nature. Scientists, for
example, try to be the masters of material nature, life after life, not caring to understand the Supreme
Person, under whose direction everything within this material world is moving. Trying to be the masters
of material nature, they are imitation gods who declare to the public that scientific advancement will one
day be able to avoid the so-called control of God. In fact, however, the living being, unable to control the
rulings of God, is forced to associate with the prostitute of polluted intelligence and accept various
material bodies. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.22):
purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhunkte prakrti-jan gunan
karanam guna-sango 'sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.
This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various
species." If one fully engages in temporary fruitive activities and does not solve this real problem, what
profit will he gain?
