<h2>Text</h2>
vasudeve bhagavati
bhaktim udvahatam nrnam
jnana-vairagya-viryanam
na hi kascid vyapasrayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vasudeve--to Lord Vasudeva, Krsna; bhagavati--the Supreme personality of Godhead; bhaktim--love and
faith in devotional service; udvahatam--for those who are carrying; nrnam--men; jnana-vairagya--of real
knowledge and detachment; viryanam--possessing the powerful strength; na--not; hi--indeed; kascit--
anything; vyapasrayah--as interest or shelter.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons engaged in devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, have naturally perfect knowledge and
detachment from this material world. Therefore such devotees are not interested in the so-called
happiness or so-called distress of this world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is the distinction between a devotee and a philosopher who speculates on the subject matter of
transcendence. A devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary
existence of this material world. Because of his unalloyed devotion to Vasudeva, this knowledge and
detachment are automatically manifested in his person. As confirmed elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to Vasudeva, Krsna, automatically becomes aware of
this material world, and therefore he is naturally detached. This detachment is possible because of his
high standard of knowledge. The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is
false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a
devotee, without separate endeavor. The Mayavadi philosophers may be very proud of their so-called
knowledge, but because they do not understand Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti), they do not understand
the world of duality, which is a manifestation of Vasudeva's external energy. Therefore, unless the socalled
jnanis take shelter of Vasudeva, their speculative knowledge is imperfect. Ye 'nye 'ravindaksa
vimukta-maninah. They simply think of becoming free from the contamination of the material world, but
because they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of Vasudeva, their knowledge is impure. When they
actually become pure, they surrender to the lotus feet of Vasudeva. Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier
to understand for a devotee than for jnanis who simply speculate to understand Vasudeva. Lord Siva
confirms this statement in the following verse.
