nanu bhagavata nityam
bhutanugraha-katarah
rte tvam sauhrda-ghnam vai
vairan-karam avairinam
SYNONYMS
nanu--now; bhagavatah--devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nityam--eternally; bhutaanugraha-
katarah--very much anxious to bestow benedictions upon the fallen conditioned souls; rte--
except; tvam--yourself; sauhrda-ghnam--a breaker of friendship (therefore not countable among the
bhagavatas, or devotees of the Lord); vai--indeed; vairam-karam--you create enmity; avairinam--toward
persons who are not enemies.
TRANSLATION
All the devotees of the Lord but you are very kind to the conditioned souls and are eager to benefit
others. Although you wear the dress of a devotee, you create enmity with people who are not your
enemies, or you break friendship and create enmity between friends. Are you not ashamed of posing as a
devotee while performing these abominable actions?
PURPORT
Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of Narada Muni in the disciplic succession.
Through the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and
return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated
neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this Krsna
consciousness movement. In India the caste brahmanas have become enemies of the Krsna consciousness
movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be mlecchas and yavanas, to the position of
brahmanas. We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as brahmanas by awarding
them sacred threads. Thus the caste brahmanas of India are very displeased by our activities in the
Western world. In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also
become enemies. We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will
always be inimical toward us. Nevertheless, as stated in the sastras, a devotee should be both tolerant and
merciful. Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet
they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls. If one can execute his duty in the disciplic
succession of Narada Muni, his service will surely be recognized. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(18.68-69):
ya idam paramam guhyam
mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati
bhaktim mayi param krtva
mam evaisyaty asamsayah
na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah
bhavita na ca me tasmad
anyah priyataro bhuvi
"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the
end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there
ever be one more dear." Let us continue preaching the message of Lord Krsna and not be afraid of
enemies. Our only duty is to satisfy the Lord by this preaching, which will be accepted as service by Lord
Caitanya and Lord Krsna. We must sincerely serve the Lord and not be deterred by so-called enemies.
In this verse the word sauhrda-ghnam ("a breaker of friendship") is used. Because Narada Muni and the
members of his disciplic succession disrupt friendships and family life, they are sometimes accused of
being sauhrda-ghnam, creators of enmity between relatives. Actually such devotees are friends of every
living entity (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam), but they are misunderstood to be enemies. Preaching can be a
difficult, thankless task, but a preacher must follow the orders of the Supreme Lord and be unafraid of
materialistic persons.
