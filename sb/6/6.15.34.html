citraketur uvaca
ajita jitah sama-matibhih
sadhubhir bhavan jitatmabhir bhavata
vijitas te 'pi ca bhajatam
akamatmanam ya atmado 'ti-karunah

by persons who have conquered the mind; sadhubhih--the devotees; bhavan--Your Lordship;
jita-atmabhih--who have completely controlled the senses; bhavata--by You; vijitah--conquered; te--they;
api--also; ca--and; bhajatam--to those who always engage in Your service; akama-atmanam--with no

TRANSLATION
Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly
conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses. They can keep You under their control
because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You. Indeed, You give
Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.
PURPORT
The Lord and the devotees both conquer. The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are
conquered by the Lord. Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss
from their relationship. The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by Krsna and the
gopis. The gopis conquered Krsna, and Krsna conquered the gopis. Thus whenever Krsna played His flute,
He conquered the minds of the gopis, and without seeing the gopis Krsna could not be happy. Other
transcendentalists, such as jnanis and yogis, cannot conquer the Supreme personality of Godhead; only
pure devotees can conquer Him.
Pure devotees are described as sama-mati, which means that they never deviate from devotional service
under any circumstances. It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they
worship Him even when in distress. Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional
service. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam says that devotional service is ahaituky apratihata, unmotivated
and uninterrupted. When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive
(anyabhilasita-sunyam), his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (apratihata). Thus a
devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the jnanis and yogis, is
that jnanis and yogis artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for
such an impossible accomplishment. Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the
Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him. Therefore they are called sama-mati or jitatma. They detest
oneness with the Supreme. They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from
all material hankering. Therefore they are called niskama, desireless. A living entity cannot exist without
desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called kama, lusty desires. Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah:
because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence. Thus they are unable to conquer
the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord.
Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are pure, being
free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers
them. Such devotees never aspire for liberation. They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord.
Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord.
The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for
material profit, naturally He is conquered.
Devotees are always engaged in service.
sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor
vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane
All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. Because of such devotion, the
Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire. Of course,
devotees have no purpose other than to serve. When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for
material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service. This is the position of the Lord
when conquered by His devotees.
