<h2>Translation</h2>
That saintly Dadhyanca, who is also known as Dadhici, personally assimilated the spiritual science and
then delivered it to the Asvini-kumaras. It is said that Dadhyanca gave them mantras through the head of
a horse. Therefore the mantras are called Asvasira. After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from
Dadhici, the Asvini-kumaras became jivan-mukta, liberated even in this life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The following story is narrated by many acaryas in their commentaries:
nisamyatharvanam daksam pravargya-brahmavidyayoh; dadhyancam samupagamya tam ucatur
athasvinau; bhagavan dehi nau vidyam iti srutva sa cabravit; karmany avasthito 'dyaham pascad vaksyami
gacchatam; tayor nirgatayor eva sakra agatya tam munim; uvaca bhisajor vidyam ma vadir asvinor mune;
yadi mad-vakyam ullanghya bravisi sahasaiva te; siras-chindyam na sandeha ity uktva sa yayau harih;
indre gate tathabhyetya nasatyav ucatur dvijam; tan-mukhad indra-gaditam srutva tav ucatuh punah;
avam tava siras chittva purvam asvasya mastakam; sandhasyavas tato bruhi tena vidyam ca nau dvija;
tasminn indrena sanchinne punah sandhaya mastakam; nijam te daksinam dattva gamisyavo yathagatam;
etac chrutva tadovaca dadhyann atharvanas tayoh pravargyam brahma-vidyam ca sat-krto 'satya-sankitah.
The great saint Dadhici had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had
advanced spiritual knowledge as well. Knowing this, the Asvini-kumaras once approached him and
begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidya). Dadhici Muni replied, "I am now
engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities. Come back some time later." When the Asvinikumaras
left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadhici and said, "My dear Muni, the Asvinikumaras
are only physicians. Please do not instruct them in spiritual science. If you impart the spiritual
science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head." After warning Dadhici
in this way, Indra returned to heaven. The Asvini-kumaras, who understood Indra's desires, returned and
begged Dadhici for brahma-vidya. When the great saint Dadhici informed them of Indra's threat, the
Asvini-kumaras replied, "Let us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse. You can
instruct brahma-vidya through the horse's head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall
reward you and restore your original head." Since Dadhici had promised to impart brahma-vidya to the
Asvini-kumaras, he agreed to their proposal. Therefore, because Dadhici imparted brahma-vidya through
the mouth of a horse, this brahma-vidya is also known as Asvasira.
