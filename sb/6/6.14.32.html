<h2>Translation</h2>
With tears of love and affection, Citraketu repeatedly moistened the resting place of the Supreme Lord's
lotus feet. Because his voice was choked in ecstasy, for a considerable time he was unable to utter any of
the letters of the alphabet to offer the Lord suitable prayers.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All the letters of the alphabet and the words constructed by those letters are meant for offering prayers
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Maharaja Citraketu had the opportunity to offer prayers to the
Lord by composing nice verses from the letters of the alphabet, but because of his ecstasy, for a
considerable time he could not join those letters to offer prayers to the Lord. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.5.22):
idam hi pumsas tapasah srutasya va
svistasya suktasya ca buddhi-dattayoh
avicyuto 'rthah kavibhir nirupito
yad uttamasloka-gunanuvarnanam
If one has scientific, philosophical, political, economic or any other abilities and wants perfection in his
knowledge, he should offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by composing first-class
poetry or engaging his talents in the service of the Lord. Citraketu wanted to do this, but he was unable
because of loving ecstasy. Therefore he had to wait for a considerable time before be could offer prayers.
