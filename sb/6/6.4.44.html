naradah--Narada Muni; sadhu-sammatah--who is an approved sadhu; etavan--this much; sadhu-vadah--

<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, since Narada Muni is an approved saintly person, when
cursed by Prajapati Daksa he replied, "tad badham: Yes, what you have said is good. I accept this curse."
He could have cursed Prajapati Daksa in return, but because he is a tolerant and merciful sadhu, he took
no action.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.21):
titiksavah karunikah
suhrdah sarva-dehinam
ajata-satravah santah
sadhavah sadhu-bhusanah
"The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no
enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime." Because
Narada Muni is the most elevated of sadhus, devotees, to deliver Prajapati Daksa he silently tolerated the
curse. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has taught this principle to all His devotees:
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the
straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should
be ready to offer all respects to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord
constantly." Following the orders of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord
all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree
because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life. Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments. Not
only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury. For example, when
Nityananda Prabhu went to preach Krsna consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jagai and Madhai,
they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who
became perfect Vaisnavas. This is the duty of a preacher. Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion.
Therefore the curse against Narada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it.
Now, it may be asked why Narada Muni stayed in the presence of Prajapati Daksa and tolerated all his
accusations and curses. Was that for Daksa's deliverance? The answer is yes. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that after being insulted by Prajapati Daksa, Narada Muni should have left immediately, but
he purposely stayed to hear all Daksa's strong words so that Daksa might be relieved of his anger.
Prajapati Daksa was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities.
Therefore Narada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Daksa, satisfied and freed from anger,
would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vaisnava and be delivered. When Jagai
and Madhai offended Lord Nityananda, Lord Nityananda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell
at His lotus feet and repented. Consequently they later became perfect Vaisnavas.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
entitled "Narada Muni Cursed by Prajapati Daksa."
Chapter Six
The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksa
As described in this chapter, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.
These daughters were given in charity to various persons to increase the population. Since these offspring
of Daksa were women, Narada Muni did not try to lead them toward the renounced order of life. Thus the
daughters were saved from Narada Muni. Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to Dharmaraja,
thirteen to Kasyapa Muni, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, Candra. In this way fifty daughters were
distributed, and of the other ten daughters, four were given to Kasyapa and two each to Bhuta, Angira and
Krsasva. One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted
personalities that the entire universe was filled with various kinds of living entities, such as human
beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.
