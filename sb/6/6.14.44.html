<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing
You. Not to speak of seeing You personally, merely by hearing the holy name of Your Lordship only once,
even candalas, men of the lowest class, are freed from all material contamination. Under the
circumstances, who will not be freed from material contamination simply by seeing You?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.5.16), yan-nama-sruti-matrena puman bhavati nirmalah: simply
by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one is immediately purified. Therefore, in this age of Kali, when all
people are very contaminated, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended as the only
means of improvement.
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." (Brhan-naradiya purana)
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu introduced this chanting of the holy name five hundred years ago, and now
through the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement, we are actually seeing that men
who are considered to belong to the lowest class are being delivered from all sinful activities simply by
hearing the holy name of the Lord. Samsara, material existence, is a result of sinful actions. Everyone in
this material world is condemned, yet as there are different grades of prisoners, there are different grades
of men. All of them, in all statuses of life, are suffering. To stop the suffering of material existence, one
must take to the Hare Krsna movement of sankirtana or Krsna conscious life.
Herein it is said, yan-nama sakrc chravanat: the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so
powerful that if once heard without offenses, it can purify the lowest of men (kirata-hunandhra-pulindapulkasah).
Such men, who are called candalas, are less than sudras, but they also can be purified simply
by hearing the holy name of the Lord, not to speak of personally seeing the Lord. From our present
position, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be personally seen as the Deity in the temple. The
Deity of the Lord is not different from the Supreme Lord. Because we cannot see the Supreme Lord with
our present blunt eyes, the Lord has kindly consented to come before us in a form we can see. Therefore
the Deity in the temple should not be considered material. By offering food to the Deity and by decorating
and serving the Deity, one gets the same result that one derives from serving the Lord personally in
Vaikuntha.
