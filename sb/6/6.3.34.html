yah prakrtair jnana-pathair jananam

yathanilah parthivam asrito gunam
sa isvaro me kurutam manoratham
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--who; prakrtaih--lower grade; jnana-pathaih--by the paths of worship; jananam--of all living
entities; yatha-asayam--according to the desire; deha-gatah--situated within the core of the heart; vibhati--
manifests; yatha--just as; anilah--the air; parthivam--earthly; asritah--receiving; gunam--the quality (like
flavor and color); sah--He; isvarah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; me--my; kurutam--may He
fulfill; manoratham--desire (for devotional service).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors
resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according
to one's desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form. What is the use of
these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The impersonalists imagine the various demigods to be forms of the Lord. For example, the Mayavadis
worship five demigods (pancopasana). They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the
sake of worship they imagine some form to be God. Generally they imagine a form of Visnu, a form of
Siva, and forms of Ganesa, the sun-god and Durga. This is called pancopasana. Daksa, however, wanted to
worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord Krsna.
In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the difference between the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being. As pointed out in a previous verse, sarvam puman
veda gunams ca taj-jno na veda sarva jnam anantam ide: the omnipotent Supreme Lord knows everything,
but the living being does not actually know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita, "I know everything, but no one knows Me." This is the difference between the Supreme
Lord and an ordinary living being. In a prayer in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Queen Kunti says, "My dear Lord,
You exist inside and outside, yet no one can see You."
The conditioned soul cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by speculative knowledge
or by imagination. One must therefore know the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He reveals Himself, but He cannot be understood by speculation. As
stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.29):
athapi te deva padambuja-dvayaprasada-
lesanugrhita eva hi
janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno
na canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan
"My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the
greatness of Your personality. But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead
are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years."
This is the verdict of the sastra. An ordinary man may be a great philosopher and may speculate upon
what the Absolute Truth is, what His form is and where He is existing, but be cannot understand these
truths. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: one can understand the Supreme Personality
of Godhead only through devotional service. This is also explained by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Himself in Bhagavad-gita (18.55). Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: "One can
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service." Unintelligent
persons want to imagine or concoct a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but devotees want to
worship the actual Personality of Godhead. Therefore Daksa prays, "One may think of You as personal,
impersonal or imaginary, but I wish to pray to Your Lordship that You fulfill my desires to see You as You
actually are."
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that this verse is especially meant for the impersonalist,
who thinks that he himself is the Supreme because there is no difference between the living being and
God. The Mayavadi philosopher thinks that there is only one Supreme Truth and that he is also that
Supreme Truth. Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such
fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (mayayapahrta jnanah). Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that such persons, jnani-maninah, think themselves very advanced, but actually they are
unintelligent.
In regard to this verse, Srila Madhvacarya says:
svadeha-stham harim prahur
adhama jivam eva tu
madhyamas capy anirnitam
jivad bhinnam janardanam
There are three classes of men--the lowest (adhama), those in the middle (madhyama), and the best
(uttama). The lowest (adhama) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except
that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations. In their
opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the jiva, the living entity, will mix
with the Supreme. They give the argument of ghatakasa-patakasa, in which the body is compared to a pot
with the sky within and the sky without. When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky
outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme. This is their
argument, but Srila Madhvacarya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men.
Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is
a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being. Such philosophers are accepted as
mediocre. The best, however. are those who understand the Supreme Lord (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha).
Purnanandadi-gunakam sarva jiva-vilaksanam: His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and
completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity. Uttamas tu harim prahus
taratamyena tesu ca: such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature. They know that
there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme
power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees
he may be able to understand that Krsna is the Supreme personality of Godhead. As Lord Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: "There is no truth superior to Me." Aham
adir hi devanam: "I am the origin of all the demigods." Aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am superior to
everyone, even Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods." These are the conclusions of the sastra,
and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher. Such a philosopher
knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (deva-devesvaram sutram
anandam prana-vedinah).

<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is extremely affectionate to
His devotees, was very pleased by the prayers offered by Daksa, and thus He appeared at that holy place
known as Aghamarsana. O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Kuru dynasty, the Lord's lotus feet rested on the
shoulders of His carrier, Garuda, and He appeared with eight long, mighty, very beautiful arms. In His
hands He held a disc, conchshell, sword, shield, arrow, bow, rope and club--in each hand a different
weapon, all brilliantly shining. His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish. His eyes and
face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers. His chest was
decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of Srivatsa. On His head was a gorgeous round helmet,
and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks. All these ornaments were uncommonly
beautiful. The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle
bells on His feet. Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living
entities of the three worlds, is known as Purusottama, the best personality. He was accompanied by great
devotees like Narada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the
residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and Caranaloka. Situated
on both sides of the Lord and behind Him as well, these devotees offered Him prayers continuously.
