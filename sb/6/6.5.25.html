te ca pitra samadistah
praja-sarge dhrta-vratah
narayana-saro jagmur
yatra siddhah sva-purvajah
SYNONYMS
te--these sons (the Savalasvas); ca--and; pitra--by their father; samadistah--being ordered; praja-sarge--in
increasing progeny or population; dhrta-vratah--accepted vows; narayana-sarah--the holy lake named
Narayana-saras; jagmuh--went to; yatra--where; siddhah--perfected; sva-purva-jah--their older brothers,
who had previously gone there.
TRANSLATION
In accordance with their father's order to beget children, the second group of sons also went to
Narayana-saras, the same place where their brothers had previously attained perfection by following the
instructions of Narada. Undertaking great vows of austerity, the Savalasvas remained at that holy place.
PURPORT
Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons to the same place where his previous sons had attained
perfection. He did not hesitate to send his second group of sons to the same place, although they too
might become victims of Narada's instructions. According to the Vedic culture, one should be trained in
spiritual understanding as a brahmacari before entering household life to beget children. This is the Vedic
system. Thus Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons for cultural improvement, despite the risk
that because of the instructions of Narada they might become as intelligent as their older brothers. As a
dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the
perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot
in this material world in various species of life. In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give
cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go. Responsible fathers should not
hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the Krsna consciousness
movement. This is not a father's duty. The duty of a father is to give his son complete freedom to make his
choice after becoming spiritually advanced by following the instructions of the spiritual master.
