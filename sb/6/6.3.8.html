etenaiva hy aghono 'sya
krtam syad agha-niskrtam
yada narayanayeti
jagada catur-aksaram
SYNONYMS
etena--by this (chanting); eva--indeed; hi--certainly; aghonah--who possesses sinful reactions; asya--of
this (Ajamila); krtam--performed; syat--is; agha--of sins; niskrtam--complete atonement; yada--when;
narayana--O Narayana (the name of his son); aya--please come; iti--thus; jagada--he chanted; catuhaksaram--
the four syllables (na-ra-ya-na).
TRANSLATION
The Visnudutas continued: Even previously, while eating and at other times, this Ajamila would call his
son, saying, "My dear Narayana, please come here." Although calling the name of his son, he nevertheless
uttered the four syllables na-ra-ya-na. Simply by chanting the name of Narayana in this way, he
sufficiently atoned for the sinful reactions of millions of lives.
PURPORT
Previously, when engaged in sinful activities to maintain his family, Ajamila chanted the name of
Narayana without offenses. To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one's sinful activities, or
to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (namno balad yasya hi
papa-buddhih). But although Ajamila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of
Narayana to counteract them; he simply chanted the name Narayana to call his son. Therefore his
chanting was effective. Because of chanting the holy name of Narayana in this way, he had already
vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives. In the beginning he was pure, but
although he later committed many sinful acts, he was offenseless because he did not chant the holy name
of Narayana to counteract them. One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is
always pure. As confirmed in this verse Ajamila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of
Narayana he remained sinless. It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.
TEXTS 9-10

stri-raja-pitr-go-hanta
ye ca patakino 'pare
sarvesam apy aghavatam
idam eva suniskrtam

SYNONYMS
stenah--one who steals; sura-pah--a drunkard; mitra-dhruk--one who turns against a friend or relative;
brahma-ha--one who kills a brahmana; guru-talpa-gah--one who indulges in sex with the wife of his
teacher or guru; stri--women; raja--king; pitr--father; go--of cows; hanta--the killer; ye--those who; ca--
also; patakinah--committed sinful activities; apare--many others; sarvesam--of all of them; api--although;
agha-vatam--persons who have committed many sins; idam--this; eva--certainly; su-niskrtam--perfect
atonement; nama-vyaharanam--chanting of the holy name; visnoh--of Lord Visnu; yatah--because of
which; tat-visaya--on the person who chants the holy name; matih--His attention.
TRANSLATION
The chanting of the holy name of Lord Visnu is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other
valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a brahmana, or for
one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of
atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all
other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu, such sinful persons may attract the
attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers, "Because this man has chanted My holy name,
My duty is to give him protection."
