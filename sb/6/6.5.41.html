nanubhuya na janati
puman visaya-tiksnatam
nirvidyate svayam tasman
na tatha bhinna-dhih paraih
SYNONYMS
na--not; anubhuya--experiencing; na--not; janati--knows; puman--a person; visaya-tiksnatam--the
sharpness of material enjoyment; nirvidyate--becomes aloof; svayam--himself; tasmat--from that; na
tatha--not like that; bhinna-dhih--whose intelligence is changed; paraih--by others.
TRANSLATION
Material enjoyment is indeed the cause of all unhappiness, but one cannot give it up unless one has
personally experienced how much suffering it is. Therefore one should be allowed to remain in so-called
material enjoyment while simultaneously advancing in knowledge to experience the misery of this false
material happiness. Then, without help from others, one will find material enjoyment detestful. Those
whose minds are changed by others do not become as renounced as those who have personal experience.
PURPORT
It is said that unless a woman becomes pregnant, she cannot understand the trouble of giving birth to a
child. Bandhya ki bujhibe prasava-vedana. The word bandhya means a sterile woman. Such a woman
cannot give birth to a child. How, then, can she perceive the pain of delivery? According to the
philosophy of Prajapati Daksa, a woman should first become pregnant and then experience the pain of
childbirth. Then, if she is intelligent, she will not want to be pregnant again. Actually. however. this is not
a fact. Sex enjoyment is so strong that a woman becomes pregnant and suffers at the time of childbirth.
but she becomes pregnant again, despite her experience. According to Daksa's philosophy. one should
become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment. one
will automatically renounce. Material nature, however. is so strong that although a man suffers at every
step, he will not cease his attempts to enjoy (trpyanti neha krpana-bahu-duhkha-bhajah). Under the
circumstances, unless one gets the association of a devotee like Narada Muni or his servant in the disciplic
succession, one's dormant spirit of renunciation cannot be awakened. It is not a fact that because material
enjoyment involves so many painful conditions one will automatically become detached. One needs the
blessings of a devotee like Narada Muni. Then one can renounce his attachment for the material world.
The young boys and girls of the Krsna consciousness movement have given up the spirit of material
enjoyment not because of practice but by the mercy of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His servants.
