<h2>Text</h2>
esa prakrti-sangena
purusasya viparyayah
asit sa eva na cirad
isa-sangad viliyate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
esah--this; prakrti-sangena--because of association with the material nature; purusasya--of the living
entity; viparyayah--a situation of forgetfulness or an awkward position; asit--came to be; sah--that
position; eva--indeed; na--not; cirat--taking a long time; isa-sangat--from the association of the Supreme
Lord; viliyate--is vanquished.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the
human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee,
this position can be overcome.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word prakrti means material nature, and purusa may also refer to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with prakrti, the female energy of Krsna, and be
separated from Krsna by the illusion that he is able to enjoy prakrti, he must continue in his conditional
life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (purusam
sasvatam), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah: one must simply understand the
Supreme Person, Krsna, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes. This will keep one always in
the association of Krsna. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so'rjuna: thus after giving up his gross
material body, one accepts not another gross body but a spiritual body in which to return home, back to
Godhead. Thus one ends the tribulation caused by his association with the material energy. In summary,
the living entity is an eternal servant of God, but he comes to the material world and is bound by material
conditions because of his desire to lord it over matter. Liberation means giving up this false consciousness
and reviving one's original service to the Lord. This return to one's original life is called mukti, as
confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih).

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the beginning this brahmana named Ajamila studied all the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of
good character, good conduct and good qualities. Firmly established in executing all the Vedic
injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control. Furthermore, he
was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Ajamila was
very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire-god, guests, and the elderly members of his household.
Indeed, he was free from false prestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved.
He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The order carriers of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety
and how a living entity is entangled in this material world. Describing the history of Ajamila's life, the
Yamadutas relate that in the beginning he was a learned scholar of the Vedic literature. He was well
behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone. In fact, he had all good qualities. In other words, he
was like a perfect brahmana. A brahmana is expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative
principles and to have all good qualities. The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses. Srila
Viraraghava Acarya comments that dhrta-vrata means dhrtam vratam stri-sanga-rahityatmakabrahmacarya-
rupam. In other words, Ajamila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfect
brahmacari and was very softhearted, truthful, clean and pure. How he fell down in spite of all these
qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamaraja will be described in the following
verses.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once this brahmana Ajamila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers
and two kinds of grass, called samit and kusa. On the way home, he came upon a sudra, a very lusty,
fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The sudra was smiling,
singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the sudra and the prostitute were drunk. The
prostitute's eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in
which Ajamila saw them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
While traveling along the public way, Ajamila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are
vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very
frequently. In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world
have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken sudra and the prostitute,
Ajamila, who was a perfect brahmacari, was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and
we must consider the position of a brahmacari student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmacari to
remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles.
Nevertheless, if one takes to Krsna consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created
by sin. In our Krsna consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and
gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight,
especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult.
Nevertheless, if by the grace of Krsna one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare Krsna
mantra, Krsna will certainly protect him. Indeed, Krsna says that His devotee is never vanquished
(kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). Therefore all the disciples practicing Krsna
consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy
name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one's position is very dangerous, especially in
this Kali-yuga.
