TRANSLATION
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You. O Lord, since You are
the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited
glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls. Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong
without knowing what is actually right. Their arguments are always false and their judgments
inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You. Because
their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the
truth concerning You. Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their
theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions. You are one
without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress,
are not contradictory. Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like. With the
help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position,
You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (atmarama). He
enjoys bliss in two ways--when He appears happy and when He appears distressed. Distinctions and
contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence.
There is no limit to His powers. Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from
the material world can exist in Him. He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of
material happiness and distress do not apply to Him.
We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually
there are no contradictions. That is the meaning of His being supreme. Because He is all-powerful, He is
not subject to the conditioned soul's arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence. He is pleased to
protect His devotees by killing their enemies. He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.
Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees. In Vrndavana, the
damsels of Vrajabhumi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when Krsna and Balarama leave
Vrndavana for Mathura. There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be
distressed or happy. One who is atmarama is blissful in both ways.
Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees.
Therefore in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, bhaktya mam abhijanati: the transcendental pastimes can be
understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable. Acintyah khalu ye bhava
na tams tarkena yojayet: the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are
inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical
arguments. They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth.
