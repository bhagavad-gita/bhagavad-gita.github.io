<h2>Text</h2>
tam vivaksum abhipretya
mahapurusa-kinkarah
sahasa pasyatas tasya
tatrantardadhire 'nagha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him (Ajamila); vivaksum--desiring to speak; abhipretya--understanding; mahapurusa-kinkarah--
the order carriers of Lord Visnu; sahasa--suddenly; pasyatah tasya--while he looked on; tatra--there;
antardadhire--disappeared; anagha--O sinless Maharaja Pariksit.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O sinless Maharaja Pariksit, the order carriers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Visnudutas,
saw that Ajamila was attempting to say something, and thus they suddenly disappeared from his presence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The sastras say:
papistha ye duracara
deva-brahmana-nindakah
apathya-bhojanas tesam
akale maranam dhruvam
"For persons who are papistha, very sinful, and duracara, misbehaved or very unclean in their habits,
who are against the existence of God, who disrespect Vaisnavas and brahmanas, and who eat anything
and everything, untimely death is sure." It is said that in Kali-yuga one has a maximum lifetime of one
hundred years, but as people become degraded, the duration of their lives decreases (prayenalpayusah).
Because Ajamila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to
have died immediately. When the Visnudutas saw Ajamila trying to say something to them, they
disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord. Since all his sinful reactions had been
vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is
completely free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." The Visnudutas made Ajamila aware of devotional service so that He might immediately
become fit to return home, back to Godhead. To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they
disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of
the Lord is very intense.
