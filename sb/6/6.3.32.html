<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asti--there is; iti--thus; na--not; asti--there is; iti--thus; ca--and; vastu-nisthayoh--professing knowledge
of the ultimate cause; eka-sthayoh--with one and the same subject matter, establishing Brahman; bhinna--

of the ways of nature); samam--the same; param--transcendental; hi--indeed; anukulam--dwelling place;
brhat tat--that ultimate cause.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There are two parties--namely, the theists and the atheists. The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds
the spiritual cause through mystic yoga. The Sankhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material
elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause--whether
Bhagavan, Paramatma or even Brahman. Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external
activities of material nature. Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because
although they offer opposing statements, their object is the same ultimate cause. They are both
approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually there are two sides to this argument. Some say that the Absolute has no form (nirakara), and
others say that the Absolute has a form (sakara). Therefore the word form is the common factor, although
some accept it (asti or astika) whereas others try to negate it (nasti or nastika). Since the devotee
considers the word "form" (akara) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the
form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not.
In this verse the word yoga-sankhyayoh is very important. Yoga means bhakti-yoga because yogis also
accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their
hearts. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.1), dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam
yoginah. The devotee tries to come directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas
the yogi tries to find the Supersoul within the heart by meditation. Thus, both directly and indirectly,
yoga means bhakti-yoga. Sankhya, however, means physical study of the cosmic situation through
speculative knowledge. This is generally known as jnana-sastra. The Sankhyites are attached to the
impersonal Brahman, but the Absolute Truth is known in three ways. Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti
sabdyate: the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul
existing everywhere, and some as Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is the
Absolute Truth.
Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same
Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth. In the yoga-sastras, Krsna is described as follows: krsnam
pisangambaram ambujeksanam catur-bhujam sankha-gadady-udayudham. Thus the pleasing appearance
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described. The
sankhya-sastra, however, denies the existence of the Lord's transcendental form. The sankhya-sastra says
that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: hy anama-rupa-guna-pani-padam
acaksur asrotram ekam advitiyam api nama-rupadikam nasti. The Vedic mantras say, apani-pado javano
grahita: the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him. Actually
such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and
legs. This is why the Absolute is called aprakrta. Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a saccid-
ananda-vigraha, a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form. The Sankhyites, or
jnanis, deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan,
has no material form.
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." The conception of
the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are
apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person.
Therefore the word vastu-nisthayoh, which is used herein, indicates that both the yogis and Sankhyites
have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual
identities. Parabrahman, or brhat, is the common point. The Sankhyites and yogis are both situated in that
same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision.
The directions given by the bhakti-sastra point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme
Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati: "Only by devotional service am I
to be known." The bhaktas know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the jnanis
simply deny the material form. One should therefore take shelter of the bhakti-marga, the path of
devotion; then everything will be clear. Jnanis concentrate on the virat-rupa, the gigantic universal form
of the Lord. This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is
no need to think continuously of the virat-rupa. When Arjuna was shown the virat-rupa of Krsna, he saw
it, but he did not want to see it perpetually. He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form
as two-armed Krsna. In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees' concentration
upon the spiritual form of the Lord (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah). In this regard,
Srila Madhvacarya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but
because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
the ultimate goal.
