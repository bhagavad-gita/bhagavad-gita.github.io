<h2>Translation</h2>
Ajamila then saw three awkward persons with deformed bodily features, fierce, twisted faces, and hair
standing erect on their bodies. With ropes in their hands, they had come to take him away to the abode of
Yamaraja. When he saw them he was extremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who
was playing a short distance away, Ajamila began to call him loudly by his name. Thus with tears in his
eyes he somehow or other chanted the holy name of Narayana.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A person who performs sinful activities performs them with his body, mind and words. Therefore three
order carriers from Yamaraja came to take Ajamila to Yamaraja's abode. Fortunately, even though he was
referring to his son, Ajamila chanted the four syllables of the hari-nama Narayana, and therefore the order
carriers of Narayana, the Visnudutas, also immediately arrived there. Because Ajamila was extremely
afraid of the ropes of Yamaraja, he chanted the Lord's name with tearful eyes. Actually, however, he never
meant to chant the holy name of Narayana; he meant to call his son.
