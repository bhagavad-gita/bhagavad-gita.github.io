<h2>Text</h2>
jijivisunam jivanam
atma prestha ihepsitah
ka utsaheta tam datum
bhiksamanaya visnave
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jijivisunam--aspiring to remain alive; jivanam--of all living entities; atma--the body; presthah--very dear;
iha--here; ipsitah--desired; kah--who; utsaheta--can bear; tam--that body; datum--to deliver;
bhiksamanaya--begging; visnave--even to Lord Visnu.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this material world, every living entity is very much addicted to his material body. Struggling to keep
his body forever, everyone tries to protect it by all means, even at the sacrifice of all his possessions.
Therefore, who would be prepared to deliver his body to anyone, even if it were demanded by Lord
Visnu?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said, atmanam sarvato rakset tato dharmam tato dhanam: one must protect his body by all means;
then he may protect his religious principles and thereafter his possessions. This is the natural desire of all
living entities. No one wants to give up his body unless it is forcibly given away. Even though the
demigods said that they were demanding Dadhici's body for their benefit in accordance with the order of
Lord Visnu, Dadhici superficially refused to give them his body.
