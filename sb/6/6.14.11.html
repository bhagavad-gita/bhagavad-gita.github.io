<h2>Text</h2>
nadatta atma hi gunam
na dosam na kriya-phalam
udasinavad asinah
paravara-drg isvarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; adatte--accepts; atma--the Supreme Lord; hi--indeed; gunam--happiness; na--not; dosam--
unhappiness; na--nor; kriya-phalam--the result of any fruitive activity; udasina-vat--exactly like a neutral
man; asinah--sitting (in the core of the heart); para-avara-drk--seeing the cause and effect; isvarah--the
Supreme Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Lord [atma], the creator of cause and effect, does not accept the happiness and distress
that result from fruitive actions. He is completely independent of having to accept a material body, and
because He has no material body, He is always neutral. The living entities, being part and parcel of the
Lord, possess His qualities in a minute quantity. Therefore one should not be affected by lamentation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conditioned soul has friends and enemies. He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his
position. The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental. Because He is the isvara, the supreme
controller, He is not affected by duality. It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone's
heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one's activities, good and bad. We should also
understand that udasina, neutral, does not mean that He takes no action. Rather, it means that He is not
personally affected. For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him,
but he still takes action as the case warrants. To become completely neutral, indifferent, to material
activities, we should simply seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme neutral person.
Maharaja Citraketu was advised that remaining neutral in such trying circumstances as the death of
one's son is impossible. Nevertheless, since the Lord knows how to adjust everything, the best course is to
depend upon Him and do one's duty in devotional service to the Lord. In all circumstances, one should be
undisturbed by duality. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.47):
karmany evadhikaras te
ma phalesu kadacana
ma karma-phala-hetur bhur
ma te sango 'stv akarmani
"You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never
consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your
duty." One should execute one's devotional duty, and for the results of one's actions one should depend
upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
