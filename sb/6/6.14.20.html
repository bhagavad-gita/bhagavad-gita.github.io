<p></p>

the waves of material nature; namah--respectful obeisances; hrsikesaya--unto the supreme
controller of the senses; mahate--unto the Supreme; namah--respectful obeisances; te--unto You; ananta--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Perceiving Your personal bliss, You are always transcendental to the waves of material nature.
Therefore, my Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the supreme controller of the
senses, and Your expansions of form are unlimited. You are the greatest, and therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse analytically differentiates the living entity from the Supreme Lord. The form of the Lord and
the form of the conditioned soul are different because the Lord is always blissful whereas the conditioned
soul is always under the threefold miseries of the material world. The Supreme Lord is sac-cid-anandavigraha.
He derives ananda, bliss, from His own self. The Lord's body is transcendental, spiritual, but
because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles. The
conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always
free from such dualities. The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is
controlled by the senses. The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest. The living
entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all
actions and reactions. The expansions of the Supreme Lord's body are innumerable (advaitam acyutam
anadim ananta-rupam), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form. From history we learn that a
conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord's bodily
expansions are unlimited. This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no
beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities.
