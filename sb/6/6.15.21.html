<h2>Text</h2>
ekah srjati bhutani
bhagavan atma-mayaya
esam bandham ca moksam ca
sukham duhkham ca niskalah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekah--one; srjati--creates; bhutani--different varieties of living entities; bhagavan--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; atma-mayaya--by His personal potencies; esam--of all the conditioned souls;
bandham--the conditional life; ca--and; moksam--the liberated life; ca--also; sukham--happiness;
duhkham--distresses; ca--and; niskalah--not affected by the material qualities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one. Unaffected by the conditions of the material world, He
creates all the conditioned souls by His own personal potency. Because of being contaminated by the
material energy, the living entity is put into ignorance and thus into different conditions of bondage.
Sometimes, by knowledge, the living entity is given liberation. In sattva-guna and rajo-guna, he is
subjected to happiness and distress.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The question may be raised why the living entities are situated in different conditions and who has
arranged this. The answer is that it has been done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without
anyone's help. The Lord has His own energies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate), and one of them,
namely the external energy, creates the material world and the varieties of happiness and distress for the
conditioned souls under the supervision of the Lord. The material world consists of three modes of
material nature--sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. By sattva-guna the Lord maintains the material
world, by rajo-guna He creates it, and by tamo-guna He annihilates it. After the varieties of living entities
are created, they are subject to happiness and distress according to their association. When they are in
sattva-guna, the mode of goodness, they feel happiness, when in rajo-guna they are distressed, and when
in tamo-guna they have no sense of what to do or what is right and wrong.
