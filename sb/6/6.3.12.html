TRANSLATION
The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to
cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one's mind again runs toward material activities.
Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting
of the Hare Krsna mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as
the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one's heart
completely.
PURPORT
The statements in this verse have been confirmed previously in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted." It is the
special mercy of the Supreme Lord that as soon as He knows that one is glorifying His name, fame and
attributes, He personally helps cleanse the dirt from one's heart. Therefore simply by such glorification
one not only becomes purified, but also achieves the results of pious activities (punya-sravana-kirtana).
Punya-sravana-kirtana refers to the process of devotional service. Even if one does not understand the
meaning of the Lord's name, pastimes or attributes, one is purified simply by hearing or chanting of them.
Such purification is called sattva-bhavana.
One's main purpose in human life should be to purify his existence and achieve liberation. As long as
one has a material body, one is understood to be impure. In such an impure, material condition, one
cannot enjoy a truly blissful life, although everyone seeks it. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.1) says,
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyet: one must perform tapasya, austerity, to purify his existence
in order to come to the spiritual platform. The tapasya of chanting and glorifying the name, fame and
attributes of the Lord is a very easy purifying process by which everyone can be happy. Therefore
everyone who desires the ultimate cleansing of his heart must adopt this process. Other processes, such as
karma, jnana and yoga, cannot cleanse the heart absolutely.
