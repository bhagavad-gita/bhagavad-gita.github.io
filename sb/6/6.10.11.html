sri-badarayanir uvaca
evam krta-vyavasito
dadhyann atharvanas tanum
pare bhagavati brahmany

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-badarayanih uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam--thus; krta-vyavasitah--making certain of what
to do (in giving his body to the demigods); dadhyan--Dadhici Muni; atharvanah--the son of Atharva;
tanum--his body; pare--to the Supreme; bhagavati--Personality of Godhead; brahmani--the Supreme
Brahman; atmanam--himself. the spirit soul; sannayan--offering; jahau--gave up.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Dadhici Muni, the son of Atharva, thus resolved to give his body to the
service of the demigods. He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As indicated by the words pare bhagavati brahmany atmanam sannayan, Dadhici placed himself, as
spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, one may refer to the
incident of Dhrtarastra's leaving his body, as described in the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(1.13.55). Dhrtarastra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of
which it was made--earth, water, fire, air and ether--and distributed them to the different reservoirs of
these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original mahat-tattva. By
identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections
and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The example given in this
connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united
with the large sky outside the pot. Mayavadi philosophers misunderstand this description of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Therefore Sri Ramanuja Svami, in his book Vedanta-tattva-sara, has described that this
merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements--
earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence--the individual soul engages himself in
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah. anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam). The material cause of the material
elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position. As described by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': the constitutional position of the
living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Krsna. When one overcomes the material body through
cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus
engage in the service of the Lord.
