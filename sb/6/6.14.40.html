<h2>Text</h2>
jitam ajita tada bhavata
yadaha bhagavatam dharmam anavadyam
niskincana ye munaya
atmarama yam upasate 'pavargaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jitam--conquered; ajita--O unconquerable one; tada--then; bhavata--by Your Lordship; yada--when;
aha--spoke; bhagavatam--which helps the devotee approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
dharmam--the religious process; anavadyam--faultless (free from contamination); niskincanah--who have
no desire to be happy with material opulences; ye--those who; munayah--great philosophers and exalted
sages; atma-aramah--who are self-satisfied (being completely aware of their constitutional position as
eternal servants of the Lord); yam--whom; upasate--worship; apavargaya--for achieving liberation from
material bondage.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O unconquerable one, when You spoke about bhagavata-dharma, which is the uncontaminated religious
system for achieving the shelter of Your lotus feet, that was Your victory. Persons who have no material
desires, like the Kumaras, who are self-satisfied sages, worship You to be liberated from material
contamination. In other words, they accept the process of bhagavata-dharma to achieve shelter at Your
lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Srila Rupa Gosvami in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desires for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service."
The Narada-pancaratra also says:
sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam
hrsikena hrsikesasevanam
bhaktir ucyate
"One should be free from all material designations and cleansed of all material contamination. He
should be restored to his pure identity, in which he engages his senses in the service of the proprietor of
the senses. That is called devotional service." This is also called bhagavata-dharma. Without material
aspirations, one should simply serve Krsna, as advised in Bhagavad-gita, Narada-pancaratra and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Bhagavata-dharma is the process of religion enunciated by pure devotees, direct
representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead like Narada, Sukadeva Gosvami and their humble
servants in the disciplic succession. By understanding bhagavata-dharma, one immediately becomes free
from material contamination. Living entities, who are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, are loitering in this material world suffering. When they are instructed by the Lord Himself
about bhagavata-dharma and they adopt it, that is victory for the Lord, for He then reclaims these fallen
souls. A devotee following the principles of bhagavata-dharma feels very much obligated to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He can understand the difference between life without bhagavata-dharma and life
with bhagavata-dharma and thus he ever remains obliged to the Lord. Taking to Krsna consciousness and
bringing fallen souls to Krsna consciousness is victory for Lord Krsna.
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
"The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving
devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and
uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self." (Bhag. 1.2.6) Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam is the
pure transcendental process of religion.
