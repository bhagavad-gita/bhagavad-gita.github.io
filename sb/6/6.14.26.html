yayav angirasa sakam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; bhaktaya--unto the devotee; etam--this; prapannaya--unto
one who fully surrendered; vidyam--transcendental knowledge; adisya--instructing; naradah--the great
sage Narada; yayau--left; angirasa--the great saint Angira; sakam--with; dhama--for the topmost planet;
svayambhuvam--belonging to Lord Brahma; prabho--O King.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Narada, having become the spiritual master of Citraketu, instructed
him fully in this prayer because Citraketu was fully surrendered. O King Pariksit, Narada then left with
the great sage Angira for the topmost planet, known as Brahmaloka.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Angira had first come to visit King Citraketu, he did not bring Narada with him. However, after
the death of Citraketu's son, Angira brought Narada to instruct King Citraketu about bhakti-yoga. The
difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the
death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of
renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions. It is
only at this stage that bhakti-yoga can be instructed. As long as one is attached to material enjoyment,
bhakti-yoga cannot be understood. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.44):
bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam
tayapahrta-cetasam
vyavasayatmika buddhih
samadhau na vidhiyate
"In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are
bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not
take place." As long as one is very much attached to material enjoyment, one cannot concentrate his mind
on the subject matter of devotional service.
The Krsna consciousness movement is progressing successfully in the Western countries at the present
moment because the youth in the West have reached the stage of vairagya, or renunciation. They are
practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of
hippies throughout the Western countries. Now if these young people are instructed about bhakti-yoga,
Krsna consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective.
As soon as Citraketu understood the philosophy of vairagya-vidya, the knowledge of renunciation, he
could understand the process of bhakti-yoga. In this regard Srila Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya has said,
vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga. Vairagya-vidya and bhakti-yoga are parallel lines. One is essential for
understanding the other. It is also said, bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag. 11.2.42).
Advancement in devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of
material enjoyment. Narada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow
causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, Angira brought Narada Muni to instruct the King. These
instructions were extremely effective. Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Narada Muni is certainly a
pure devotee.
