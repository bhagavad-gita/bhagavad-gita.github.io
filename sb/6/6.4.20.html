<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had asked how one could ignorantly defy one's own father. The Haryasvas understood
the meaning of this question.] One must accept the original instructions of the sastra. According to Vedic
civilization, one is offered a sacred thread as a sign of second birth. One takes his second birth by dint of
having received instructions in the sastra from a bona fide spiritual master. Therefore, sastra, scripture, is
the real father. All the sastras instruct that one should end his material way of life. If one does not know
the purpose of the father's orders, the sastras, he is ignorant. The words of a material father who
endeavors to engage his son in material activities are not the real instructions of the father.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhagavad-gita (16.7) says, pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidur asurah: demons, who are less than
human beings but are not called animals, do not know the meaning of pravrtti and nivrtti, work to be
done and work not to be done. In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the
material world as much as possible. This is called pravrtti-marga. All the sastras, however, advise nivrttimarga,
or release from the materialistic way of life. Apart from the sastras of the Vedic civilization, which
is the oldest of the world, other sastras agree on this point. For example, in the Buddhist sastras Lord
Buddha advises that one achieve nirvana by giving up the materialistic way of life. In the Bible, which is
also sastra, one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of
God. In any sastra one may examine, especially the Vedic sastra, the same advice is given: one should give
up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life. Sankaracarya also propounds the same
conclusion. Brahma satyam jagan mithya: this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and
therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman.
The word sastra refers to the scriptures, particularly the Vedic books of knowledge. The Vedas--Sama,
Yajur, Rg and Atharva--and any other books deriving knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic
literatures. Bhagavad-gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose
instructions should be especially accepted. In this essence of all sastras, Krsna personally advises that one
give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja).
One should be initiated into following the principles of sastra. In offering initiation, our Krsna
consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of sastra by taking the advice of the supreme
speaker of the sastra, Krsna, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life. Therefore the
principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. These four types
of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home,
back to Godhead.
In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including
even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother. Therefore, getting a
material father and mother is not a problem. In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a
father and mother. In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and
their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated
in the sastras, he certainly remains in darkness. The material father and mother are important only if they
are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death. As instructed by
Rsabhadeva (Bhag. 5.5.18): pita na sa syaj janani na sa syat. na mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum. One
should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one's dependent son from the
impending danger of death. A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such
fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on. Only a father
and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents. Therefore according
to the Vedic system it is said, janmana jayate sudrah: one is born of a material father and mother as a
sudra. The purpose of life, however, is to become a brahmana, a first-class man.
A first-class intelligent man is called a brahmana because he knows the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute
Truth. According to the Vedic instructions, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: to know this
science, one must approach a bona fide guru, a spiritual master who will initiate the disciple with the
sacred thread so that he may understand the Vedic knowledge. Janmana jayate sudrah samskarad dhi
bhaved dvijah. Becoming a brahmana through the endeavor of a bona fide spiritual master is called
samskara. After initiation, one is engaged in study of the sastra, which teaches the student how to gain
release from materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead.
The Krsna consciousness movement is teaching this higher knowledge of retiring from materialistic life
to return to Godhead, but unfortunately many parents are not very satisfied with this movement. Aside
from the parents of our students, many businessmen are also dissatisfied because we teach our students to
abandon intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling. If the Krsna consciousness movement
spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette
factories. Therefore they are also very much afraid. However, we have no alternative than to teach our
disciples to free themselves from materialistic life. We must instruct them in the opposite of material life
to save them from the repetition of birth and death.
Narada Muni, therefore, advised the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, that instead of begetting
progeny, it would be better to leave and achieve the perfection of spiritual understanding according to the
instructions of the sastras. The importance of the sastras is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (16.23):
yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na sukham na param gatim
"One who disregards the injunctions of the sastras and acts whimsically, as he likes, never achieves the
perfection of life, not to speak of happiness. Nor does he return home to the spiritual world."
