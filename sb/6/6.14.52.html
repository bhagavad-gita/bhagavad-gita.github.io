<h2>Text</h2>
loke vitatam atmanam
lokam catmani santatam
ubhayam ca maya vyaptam
mayi caivobhayam krtam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
loke--in this material world; vitatam--expanded (in the spirit of material enjoyment); atmanam--the
living entity; lokam--the material world; ca--also; atmani--in the living entity; santatam--spread;
ubhayam--both (the material world of material elements and the living entity); ca--and; maya--by Me;
vyaptam--pervaded; mayi--in Me; ca--also; eva--indeed; ubhayam--both of them; krtam--created.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this world of matter, which the conditioned soul accepts as consisting of enjoyable resources, the
conditioned soul expands, thinking that he is the enjoyer of the material world. Similarly, the material
world expands in the living entity as a source of enjoyment. In this way they both expand, but because
they are My energies, they are both pervaded by Me. As the Supreme Lord, I am the cause of these effects,
and one should know that both of them rest in Me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Mayavada philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable. This dangerous theory
of the Mayavada school has turned people in general toward atheism. On the strength of this theory, one
thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (maya tatam idam sarvam jagad
avyakta-murtina), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord's
energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities. The living entities wrongly
consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be
the enjoyers. However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord. The original
cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However,
although the expansion of the Lord's energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord
Himself has expanded in different ways. To condemn the theories of the Mayavadis, the Lord clearly says
in Bhagavad-gita, mat-sthani sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah: "All beings are in Me, but I am not
in them." Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does
not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself. The material expansion is temporary, but
the Lord is not temporary. The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself. The
living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is. The theory that the Lord's
energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great
mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away. Sometimes when
one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place. Then he sees
himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on. All the
conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is
unaffected by them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
None of these conditions of the living entities--namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness--is
substantial. They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life. There may be many mountains,
rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be
nearby. Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross
dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor. Under
the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world. One is
situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy,
which works under the direction of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord is
the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, Sri
Krsna. As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of prakrti, or nature, which works under
the Lord's direction (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram). Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, (miche)
mayara vase, yaccha bhese', khaccha habudubu, bhai: "Why are you being carried away by the waves of
the illusory energy in various phases of dreaming and wakefulness? These are all creations of maya." Our
only duty is to remember the supreme director of this illusory energy--Krsna. For us to do this, the sastra
advises us, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam: one should constantly chant the holy name of
the Lord--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare. The Supreme Lord is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan, but
Bhagavan is the ultimate realization. One who realizes Bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna--is the most perfect mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). In the human form
of life, one should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for then one will understand
everything else. Yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. According to this Vedic injunction, simply
by understanding Krsna one understands Brahman, Paramatma, prakrti, the illusory energy, the spiritual
energy and everything else. Everything will be revealed. prakrti, the material nature, is. working under the
direction of the Supreme Lord, and we living entities are being carried away by various phases of prakrti.
For self-realization, one should always remember Krsna. As stated in Padma Purana, smartavyah satatam
visnuh: we should always remember Lord Visnu. Vismartavyo na jatucit: we should never forget the Lord.
This is the perfection of life.
