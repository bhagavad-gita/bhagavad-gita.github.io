<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because they are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yajnavalkya
and Jaimini and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the secret, confidential religious
system of the twelve mahajanas. They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing
devotional service or chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic
ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas--especially the Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Rg Veda--their intelligence
has become dull. Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only
temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness. They are not attracted to the
sankirtana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, kama and moksa.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask
why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them. This verse
answers that question. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the real
purpose of studying the Vedas is to approach the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. Unfortunately, unintelligent
people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic yajnas want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed. They want
Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies. Sometimes we have to
observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men. Recently, when we established a
large Krsna-Balarama temple in Vrndavana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by
brahmanas because the inhabitants of Vrndavana, especially the smarta-brahmanas, would not accept
Europeans and Americans as bona fide brahmanas. Thus we had to engage brahmanas to perform costly
yajnas. In spite of these yajnas, the members of our Society performed sankirtana loudly with mrdangas,
and I considered the sankirtana more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Both the
ceremonies and the sankirtana were going on simultaneously. The ceremonies were meant for persons
interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (jadi-krta-matir madhu-puspitayam), whereas
the sankirtana was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
We would simply have performed sankirtana, but then the inhabitants of Vrndavana would not have
taken the installation ceremony seriously. As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those
whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the Vedas, which describe fruitive activities
intended to elevate one to the higher planets.
Especially in this age of Kali, sankirtana alone is sufficient. If the members of our temples in the
different parts of the world simply continue sankirtana before the Deity, especially before Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, they will remain perfect. There is no need of any other performances. Nevertheless, to keep
oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required. Srila Jiva
Gosvami says that although sankirtana is sufficient for the perfection of life, the arcana, or worship of the
Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure. Srila
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura therefore recommended that one follow both processes
simultaneously. We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and sankirtana along parallel
lines. This we should continue.
