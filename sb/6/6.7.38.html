<h2>Text</h2>
sa eva hi punah sarva-vastuni vastu-svarupah sarvesvarah sakala-jagat-karana-karana-bhutah sarvapratyag-
atmatvat sarva-gunabhasopalaksita eka eva paryavasesitah.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); eva--indeed; hi--certainly; punah--again; sarva-vastuni--
in everything, material and spiritual; vastu-svarupah--the substance; sarva-isvarah--the controller of
everything; sakala-jagat--of the whole universe; karana--of the causes; karana-bhutah--existing as the
cause; sarva-pratyak-atmatvat--because of being the Supersoul of every living being, or being present in
everything, even the atom; sarva-guna--of all the effects of the material modes of nature (such as
intelligence and the senses); abhasa--by the manifestations; upalaksitah--perceived; ekah--alone; eva--
indeed; paryavasesitah--left remaining.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
With deliberation, one will see that the Supreme Soul, although manifested in different ways, is actually
the basic principle of everything. The total material energy is the cause of the material manifestation, but
the material energy is caused by Him. Therefore He is the cause of all causes, the manifester of
intelligence and the senses. He is perceived as the Supersoul of everything. Without Him, everything
would be dead. You, as that Supersoul, the supreme controller, are the only one remaining.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words sarva-vastuni vastu-svarupah indicate that the Supreme Lord is the active principle of
everything. As described in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):
eko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim
yac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who enters the existence of every universe and every
atom by one of His plenary portions and thus manifests His infinite energy throughout the material
creation." By His one plenary portion as Paramatma, antaryami, the Lord is all-pervading throughout the
unlimited universes. He is the pratyak, or antaryami, of all living entities. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(13.3), ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: "O scion of Bharata, you should understand
that I am also the knower in all bodies." Because the Lord is the Supersoul, He is the active principle of
every living entity and even the atom (anda-ntara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham). He is the actual
reality. According to various stages of intelligence, one realizes the presence of the Supreme in everything
through the manifestations of His energy. The entire world is permeated by the three gunas, and one can
understand His presence according to one's modes of material nature.
