<h2>Text</h2>
yatha dhanasu vai dhana
bhavanti na bhavanti ca
evam bhutani bhutesu
coditanisa-mayaya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--just as; dhanasu--through seeds of paddy; vai--indeed; dhanah--grains; bhavanti--are generated;
na--not; bhavanti--are generated; ca--also; evam--in this way; bhutani--the living entities; bhutesu--in
other living entities; coditani--impelled; isa-mayaya--by the potency or power of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When seeds are sown in the ground, they sometimes grow into plants and sometimes do not. Sometimes
the ground is not fertile, and the sowing of seeds is unproductive. Similarly, sometimes a prospective
father, being impelled by the potency of the Supreme Lord, can beget a child, but sometimes conception
does not take place. Therefore one should not lament over the artificial relationship of parenthood, which
is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Citraketu was actually not destined to get a son. Therefore although he married hundreds and
thousands of wives, all of them proved barren, and he could not beget even one child. When Angira Rsi
came to see the King, the King requested the great sage to enable him to have at least one son. Because of
the blessing of Angira Rsi, a child was sent by the grace of maya, but the child was not to live for long.
Therefore in the beginning Angira Rsi told the King that he would beget a child who would cause
jubilation and lamentation.
King Citraketu was not destined to get a child by providence, or the will of the Supreme. Just as sterile
grain cannot produce more grain, a sterile person, by the will of the Supreme Lord, cannot beget a child.
Sometimes a child is born even to an impotent father and sterile mother, and sometimes a potent father
and fertile mother are childless. Indeed, sometimes a child is born despite contraceptive methods, and
therefore the parents kill the child in the womb. In the present age, killing children in the womb has
become a common practice. Why? When contraceptive methods are taken, why don't they act? Why is a
child sometimes produced so that the father and mother have to kill it in the womb? We must conclude
that our arrangement of so-called scientific knowledge cannot determine what will take place; what is
enacted actually depends on the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that we are situated in certain
conditions in terms of family, community and personality. These are all arrangements of the Supreme
Lord according to our desires under the spell of maya, illusion. In devotional life, therefore, one should
not desire anything, since everything depends on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11):
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." One should act only to develop Krsna consciousness. For everything else, one
should fully depend upon the Supreme Person. We should not create plans that will ultimately make us
frustrated.
