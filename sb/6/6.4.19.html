<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
kala-cakram bhrami tiksnam
sarvam niskarsayaj jagat
svatantram abudhasyeha
kim asat-karmabhir bhavet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kala-cakram--the wheel of eternal time; bhrami--revolving automatically; tiksnam--very sharp; sarvam--
all; niskarsayat--driving; jagat--the world; sva-tantram--independent, not caring for the so-called scientists
and philosophers; abudhasya--of one who does not know (this principle of time); iha--in this material
world; kim asat-karmabhih bhavet--what is the use of engaging in temporary fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had spoken of a physical object made of sharp blades and thunderbolts. The Haryasvas
understood this allegory as follows.] Eternal time moves very sharply, as if made of razors and
thunderbolts. Uninterrupted and fully independent, it drives the activities of the entire world. If one does
not try to study the eternal element of time, what benefit can he derive from performing temporary
material activities?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse explains the words ksaura-pavyam svayam bhrami, which especially refer to the orbit of
eternal time. It is said that time and tide wait for no man. According to the moral instructions of the great
politician Canakya Pandita:
ayusah ksana eko 'pi
na labhyah svarna-kotibhih
na cen nirarthakam nitih
ka ca hanis tato 'dhika
Even a moment of one's lifetime could not be returned in exchange for millions of dollars. Therefore
one should consider how much loss one suffers if he wastes even a moment of his life for nothing. Living
like an animal, not understanding the goal of life, one foolishly thinks that there is no eternity and that his
life span of fifty, sixty, or, at the most, one hundred years, is everything. This is the greatest foolishness.
Time is eternal, and in the material world one passes through different phases of his eternal life. Time is
compared herein to a sharp razor. A razor is meant to shave the hair from one's face, but if not carefully
handled, the razor will cause disaster. One is advised not to create a disaster by misusing his lifetime. One
should be extremely careful to utilize the span of his life for spiritual realization, or Krsna consciousness.
