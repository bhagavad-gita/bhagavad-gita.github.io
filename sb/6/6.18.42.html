<h2>Text</h2>
na hi kascit priyah strinam
anjasa svasisatmanam
patim putram bhrataram va
ghnanty arthe ghatayanti ca
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; hi--certainly; kascit--anyone; priyah--dear; strinam--to women; anjasa--actually; sva-asisa--for
their own interests; atmanam--most dear; patim--husband; putram--son; bhrataram--brother; va--or;
ghnanti--they kill; arthe--for their own interests; ghatayanti--cause to be killed; ca--also.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
To satisfy their own interests, women deal with men as if the men were most dear to them, but no one is
actually dear to them. Women are supposed to be very saintly, but for their own interests they can kill
even their husbands, sons or brothers, or cause them to be killed by others.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A woman's nature has been particularly well studied by Kasyapa Muni. Women are self-interested by
nature, and therefore they should be protected by all means so that their natural inclination to be too selfinterested
will not be manifested. Women need to be protected by men. A woman should be cared for by
her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age. This is the
injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage. Women must
be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness. There
have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take
advantage of their insurance policies. This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their
nature. Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life.
When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life
practically vanishes. We should see all women as spiritual units (aham brahmasmi), whose only duty is to
satisfy Krsna. Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one's
possessing a material body, will not act.
The Krsna consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination
of material nature, which results from one's possessing a material body. Bhagavad-gita therefore teaches,
in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the
body but a spiritual soul. Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body.
As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled,
whether one is a man or a woman. The soul is sometimes described as purusa because whether one is
dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world. One who has this spirit of
enjoyment is described as purusa. Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving
others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses. Krsna consciousness, however, provides
first-class training for a man or a woman. A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord
Krsna, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband. That will make the
lives of both of them happy.
