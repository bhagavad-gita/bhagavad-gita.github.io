<h2>Text</h2>
nasnatah pathyam evannam
vyadhayo 'bhibhavanti hi
evam niyamakrd rajan
sanaih ksemaya kalpate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; asnatah--those who eat; pathyam--suitable; eva--indeed; annam--food; vyadhayah--different
types of disease; abhibhavanti--overcome; hi--indeed; evam--similarly; niyama-krt--one following
regulative principles; rajan--O King; sanaih--gradually; ksemaya--for well-being; kalpate--becomes fit.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, if a diseased person eats the pure, uncontaminated food prescribed by a physician, he is
gradually cured, and the infection of disease can no longer touch him. Similarly, if one follows the
regulative principles of knowledge, he gradually progresses toward liberation from material
contamination.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One is gradually purified if one cultivates knowledge, even through mental speculation, and strictly
follows the regulative principles enjoined in the sastras and explained in the next verse. Therefore the
platform of jnana, speculative knowledge, is better than the platform of karma, fruitive action. There is
every chance of falling from the platform of karma to hellish conditions, but on the platform of jnana one
is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection. The difficulty is that on
the platform of jnana one thinks that he has been liberated and has become Narayana, or Bhagavan. This
is another phase of ignorance.
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
(Bhag. 10.2.32)
Because of ignorance, one speculatively thinks himself liberated from material contamination although
actually he is not. Therefore even if one rises to brahma jnana, understanding of Brahman, one
nevertheless falls down because of not taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna. Nonetheless, jnanis at least
know what is sinful and what is pious, and they very cautiously act according to the injunctions of the
sastras.
TEXTS 13-14

tyagena satya-saucabhyam
yamena niyamena va
deha-vag-buddhijam dhira
dharmajnah sraddhayanvitah
ksipanty agham mahad api

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tapasa--by austerity or voluntary rejection of material enjoyment; brahmacaryena--by celibacy (the first
austerity); samena--by controlling the mind; ca--and; damena--by fully controlling the senses; ca--also;
tyagena--by voluntarily giving charity to good causes; satya--by truthfulness; saucabhyam--and by
following regulative principles to keep oneself internally and externally clean; yamena--by avoiding
cursing and violence; niyamena--by regularly chanting the holy name of the Lord; va--and; deha-vakbuddhi-
jam--performed by the body, words and intelligence; dhirah--those who are sober; dharma-jnah--
fully imbued with knowledge of religious principles; sraddhaya anvitah--endowed with faith; ksipanti--
destroy; agham--all kinds of sinful activities; mahat api--although very great and abominable; venugulmam--
the dried creepers beneath a bamboo tree; iva--like; analah--fire.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down. One must undergo the
austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment. One must then control the mind and senses, give
charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy
name of the Lord. Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily
purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind. These sins are like the dried leaves of
creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again
at the first opportunity.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Tapah is explained in the smrti-sastra as follows: manasas cendriyanam ca aikagryam paramam tapah.
"Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is
called tapah." Our Krsna consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on
devotional service. This is first-class tapah. Brahmacarya, the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should
not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with
women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex
life. One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them. This is
called first-class brahmacarya. If a brahmacari or sannyasi talks with a woman in a secluded place,
naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone's knowledge. Therefore a complete
brahmacari practices just the opposite. If one is a perfect brahmacari, he can very easily control the mind
and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth. To begin, however, one must control the tongue
and the process of eating.
In the bhakti-marga, the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by
first controlling the tongue (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah). The tongue (jihva) can
be controlled if one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, does not speak of any subjects other than those
concerning Krsna and does not taste anything not offered to Krsna. If one can control the tongue in this
way, brahmacarya and other purifying processes will automatically follow. It will be explained in the next
verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of
fruitive activities and the path of knowledge. Quoting from the Vedas, Srila Viraraghava Acarya explains
that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (tapasanasakena). Srila Rupa Gosvami has also
advised that atyahara, too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life. Also, in
Bhagavad-gita (6.17) Krsna says:
yuktahara-viharasya
yukta-cestasya karmasu
yukta-svapnavabodhasya
yogo bhavati duhkha-ha
"He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material
pains by practicing the yoga system."
In text 14 the word dhirah, meaning "those who are undisturbed under all circumstances," is very
significant. Krsna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." In
material life there are many disturbances (adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika). One who has
learned to tolerate these disturbances under all circumstances is called dhira.
