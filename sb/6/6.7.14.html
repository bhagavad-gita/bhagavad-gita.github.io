<h2>Translation</h2>
Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of
destruction [as described in the previous verse] are, in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those
who blindly follow them. A stone boat would be unable to float and would sink in the water with its
passengers. Similarly, those who mislead people go to hell, and their followers go with them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Vedic literature (Bhag. 11.20.17):
nr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham
plavam sukalpam guru-karna-dharam
We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the human body fortunately
provides us a good opportunity to cross the ocean because the human body is like a very good boat. When
directed by a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the ocean. Furthermore,
the boat is helped across by favorable winds, which are the instructions of Vedic knowledge. If one does
not take advantage of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience, he is certainly committing suicide.
One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed. To be elevated to the stage of perfection, humanity
must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone. All of human society is in such a dangerous
position that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the Vedas. The cream of these
instructions appears in the form of Bhagavad-gita. One should not take shelter of any other instructions,
for Bhagavad-gita gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of human life. Lord Sri Krsna
therefore says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other processes of
religion and simply surrender to Me." Even if one does not accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and beneficial for humanity that if one follows His
instructions one will be saved. Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and gymnastic
methods of yoga. Thus one will board a boat of stone. which will sink and drown all its passengers.
Unfortunately. although the American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos, they
are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats. That will not help them. They must take the
proper boat offered by Krsna in the form of the Krsna consciousness movement. Then they will be easily
saved. In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments: asmamayah plavo yesam te yatha
majjantam plavam anumajjanti tatheti raja-nity-upadestrsu sva-sabhyesu kopo vyanjitah. If society is
guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against another, it will certainly sink like a
stone boat. political maneuvering and diplomacy will not save human society. People must take to Krsna
consciousness to understand the aim of life, to understand God. and to fulfill the human mission.
