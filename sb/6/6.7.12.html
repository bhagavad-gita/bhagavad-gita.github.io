<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kah--who; grdhyet--would accept; panditah--a learned man; laksmim--opulences; tri-pista-pa-pateh api--
although I am the King of the demigods; yaya--by which; aham--I; asuram--demoniac; bhavam--mentality;
nitah--carried to; adya--now; vibudha--of the demigods, who are in the mode of goodness; isvarah--the
King.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although I am King of the demigods, who are situated in the mode of goodness, I was proud of a little
opulence and polluted by false ego. Under the circumstances, who in this world would accept such riches
at the risk of falling down ? Alas! I condemn my wealth and opulence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu prayed to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, na dhanam na janam na
sundarim kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye: "O my Lord, I do not aspire for material opulence or wealth, nor
do I want a great number of followers to accept me as their leader, nor do I want a very beautiful wife to
please me." Mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: "I do not even want liberation.
All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship." According to the laws of nature,
when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively.
The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an
exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence. We
are now actually seeing this in America. The entire American nation has tried to advance in material
opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings. The result is that Americans are now regretting
the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and
unmanageable. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.31), na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: persons
who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore,
both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted
to wine and women. The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class. They are the
unwanted population known as varna-sankara, and as stated in Bhagavad-gita, an increase of varnasankara
population creates a hellish society. This is the society in which Americans now find themselves.
Fortunately, however, the Hare Krsna movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men
are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men
who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. If the American people
are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Krsna
consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in Bhagavad-gita (caturvarnyam
maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). They must divide their society into first-class men,
second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men. Since they are now creating only men who are
less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra
regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, Brhaspati. Similarly, it is advised that the American people
regret their mistaken advancement in civilization. They should take advice from the spiritual master, the
representative of Krsna. If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the
entire world.
