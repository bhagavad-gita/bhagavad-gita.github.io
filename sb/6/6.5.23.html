<h2>Text</h2>
nasam nisamya putranam
naradac chila-salinam
anvatapyata kah socan
suprajastvam sucam padam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nasam--the loss; nisamya--hearing of; putranam--of his sons; naradat--from Narada; sila-salinam--who
were the best of well-behaved persons; anvatapyata--suffered; kah--Prajapati Daksa; socan--lamenting; suprajastvam--
having ten thousand well-behaved sons; sucam--of lamentation; padam--position.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately,
because of the instructions of Narada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father. When Daksa
heard this news, which was brought to him by Narada Muni, he began to lament. Although he was the
father of such good sons, he had lost them all. Certainly this was lamentable.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were certainly Hell behaved, learned and advanced, and in
accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their
family. But Narada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to
be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs.
The Haryasvas abided by the order of Narada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Prajapati
Daksa, the prajapati, instead of being happy with the actions of Narada Muni, was extremely sorrowful.
Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the Krsna consciousness movement for
their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are
lamenting and making counterpropaganda. Of course, Prajapati Daksa did not make propaganda against
Narada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Daksa cursed Narada Muni for his benevolent activities. This is
the way of materialistic life. A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting
children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life. They are not
unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the Krsna
consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life. This animosity between parents and the
Krsna consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial. Even Narada Muni was condemned,
not to speak of others. Nevertheless, Narada Muni never gives up his mission. To deliver as many fallen
souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
