atah papiyasim yonim
asurim yahi durmate
yatheha bhuyo mahatam
na karta putra kilbisam
SYNONYMS
atah--therefore; papiyasim--most sinful; yonim--to the species of life; asurim--demoniac; yahi--go;
durmate--O impudent one; yatha--so that; iha--in this world; bhuyah--again; mahatam--to great
personalities; na--not; karta--will commit; putra--my dear son; kilbisam--any offense.
TRANSLATION
O impudent one, my dear son, now take birth in a low, sinful family of demons so that you will not
commit such an offense again toward exalted, saintly persons in this world.
PURPORT
One should be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of Vaisnavas, of whom Lord Siva is
the best. While instructing Srila Rupa Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu described an offense at the lotus
feet of a Vaisnava as hati mata, a mad elephant. When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the
entire garden. Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava, his entire spiritual career is halted. One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses
at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava.
Mother Parvati was justified in punishing Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticized the supreme
father, Mahadeva, who is the father of the living entities conditioned within this material world. The
goddess Durga is called mother, and Lord Siva is called father. A pure Vaisnava should be very careful to
engage in his specific duty without criticizing others. This is the safest position. Otherwise, if one tends to
criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vaisnava.
Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vaisnava, he might have been surprised that Parvati had cursed
him. Therefore the goddess Parvati addressed him as putra, or son. Everyone is the son of mother Durga,
but she is not an ordinary mother. As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon's behavior, mother
Durga immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses. This is explained by Lord
Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." To surrender to Krsna means to
surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of Krsna unless he is a proper servant of
a devotee. Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without serving a servant of Krsna, one cannot be
elevated to being a servant of Krsna Himself. Therefore mother Parvati spoke to Citraketu exactly like a
mother who says to her naughty child, "My dear child, I am punishing you so that you won't do anything
like this again." This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Yasoda, who
became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Mother Yasoda punished Krsna by binding
Him and showing Him a stick. Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case
of the Supreme Lord. It is to be understood that mother Durga was justified in punishing Citraketu. This
punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon Vrtrasura, he was promoted
directly to Vaikuntha.
