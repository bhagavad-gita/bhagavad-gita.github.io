<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
nana-rupatmano buddhih
svairiniva gunanvita
tan-nistham agatasyeha
kim asat-karmabhir bhavet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nana--various; rupa--who has forms or dresses; atmanah--of the living entity; buddhih--the intelligence;
svairini--a prostitute who freely decorates herself with different types of cloths and ornaments; iva--like;
guna-anvita--endowed with the mode of passion, and so on; tat-nistham--the cessation of that; agatasya--
of one who has not obtained; iha--in this material world; kim asat-karmabhih bhavet--what is the use of
performing temporary fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had described a woman who is a professional prostitute. The Haryasvas understood the
identity of this woman.] Mixed with the mode of passion, the unsteady intelligence of every living entity
is like a prostitute who changes dresses just to attract one's attention. If one fully engages in temporary
fruitive activities, not understanding how this is taking place, what does he actually gain?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A woman who has no husband declares herself independent, which means that she becomes a
prostitute. A prostitute generally dresses herself in various fashions intended to attract a man's attention
to the lower part of her body. Today it has become a much advertised fashion for a woman to go almost
naked, covering the lower part of her body only slightly, in order to draw the attention of a man to her
private parts for sexual enjoyment. The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body
is the intelligence of a professional prostitute. Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not
turn his attention toward Krsna or the Krsna consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a
prostitute. What is the benefit of such foolish intelligence? One should be intelligently conscious in such
a way that he need no longer change from one body to another.
Karmis change their professions at any moment, but a Krsna conscious person does not change his
profession, for his only profession is to attract the attention of Krsna by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra
and living a very simple life, without following daily changes of fashion. In our Krsna consciousness
movement, fashionable persons are taught to adopt one fashion--the dress of a Vaisnava with a shaved
head and tilaka. They are taught to be always clean in mind, dress and eating in order to be fixed in Krsna
consciousness. What is the use of changing one's dress, sometimes wearing long hair and a long beard and
sometimes dressing otherwise? This is not good. One should not waste his time in such frivolous
activities. One should always be fixed in Krsna consciousness and take the cure of devotional service with
firm determination.
