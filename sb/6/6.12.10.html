surasenesu--in the country known as Surasena; vai--indeed; nrpa--O King; citraketuh--Citraketu; iti--thus;
khyatah--celebrated; yasya--of whom; asit--was; kama-dhuk--supplying all the necessities; mahi--the

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King Pariksit, in the province of Surasena there was a king named Citraketu, who ruled the entire
earth. During his reign, the earth produced all the necessities for life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life
during the time of King Citraketu. As stated in the Isopanisad (Mantra 1):
isavasyam idam sarvam
yat kinca jagatyam jagat
tena tyaktena bhunjitha
ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam
"Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord. One
should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one
should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong." Krsna, the supreme controller, has
created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity. The Lord supplies the
necessities of all living entities. These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of
supply. When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly. However,
when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity. This is the significance of the word kamadhuk.
Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.10.4) it is said, kamam vavarsa parjanyah sarva-kama-dugha mahi:
"During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the
earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion." We have experience that in some seasons the
rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity. We have no control over the earth's
productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His
order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently. If a pious king rules the earth
according to the sastric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to
provide for all men. There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough. Blackmarketeering
and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop. Simply ruling the land cannot solve
man's problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities. He must be like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Pariksit
Maharaja or Ramacandra. Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.
