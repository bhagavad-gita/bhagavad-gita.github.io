<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
na hy asyasti priyah kascin
napriyah svah paro 'pi va
ekah sarva-dhiyam drasta
kartrnam guna-dosayoh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; hi--indeed; asya--to the living entity; asti--there is; priyah--dear; kascit--someone; na--not;
apriyah--not dear; svah--own; parah--other; api--also; va--or; ekah--the one; sarva-dhiyam--of the varieties
of intelligence; drasta--the seer; kartrnam--of the performers; guna-dosayoh--of right and wrong activities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable. He makes no distinction between that
which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else. He is one without a second; in other words, he is
not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers. He is only an observer, a witness,
of the different qualities of men.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (suksma) whereas the
Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great. For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives,
for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned
souls. On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied
with persons who are envious of His devotees. As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):
samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in
devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend,
but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service. Similarly, elsewhere in
the Gita (16.19) the Lord says:
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward
those who are envious of His devotees. To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their
enemies. For example, to protect Prahlada Maharaja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hiranyakasipu,
although Hiranyakasipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord. Since the Lord is the
witness of everyone's activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined
to punish them. In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the
results of one's sinful or pious actions.
