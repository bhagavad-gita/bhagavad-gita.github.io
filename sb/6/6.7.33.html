<h2>Translation</h2>
O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Narayana, O Vasudeva, original person! O most exalted person,
supreme experience, welfare personified! O supreme benediction, supremely merciful and changeless! O
support of the cosmic manifestation, sole proprietor of all planetary systems, master of everything and
husband of the goddess of fortune! Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sannyasis, who wander about
the world to preach Krsna consciousness, fully absorbed in samadhi through bhakti-yoga. Because their
minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully
purified hearts. When the darkness in their hearts is completely eradicated and You are revealed to them,
the transcendental bliss they enjoy is the transcendental form of Your Lordship. No one but such persons
can realize You. Therefore we simply offer You our respectful obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental names pertaining to different grades
of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists. When He is realized in His impersonal
form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Paramatma He is called antaryami, and
when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called Ksirodakasayi Visnu,
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Karanodakasayi Visnu. When He is realized as Vasudeva, Sankarsana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha--the Caturvyuha, who are beyond the three forms of Visnu--He is the
Vaikuntha Narayana. Above realization of Narayana is realization of Baladeva, and above that is
realization of Krsna. All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service. The
covered core of one's heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His various forms.
