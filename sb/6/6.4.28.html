tan anayadhvam asato vimukhan mukundapadaravinda-
makaranda-rasad ajasram
niskincanaih paramahamsa-kulair asangair
justad grhe niraya-vartmani baddha-trsnan
SYNONYMS
tan--them; anayadhvam--bring before me; asatah--nondevotees (those who have not taken to Krsna
consciousness); vimukhan--who have turned against; mukunda--of Mukunda, the Supreme personality of
Godhead; pada-aravinda--of the lotus feet; makaranda--of the honey; rasat--the taste; ajasram--
continuously; niskincanaih--by persons completely free from material attachment; paramahamsa-kulaih--
by the paramahamsas, the most exalted personalities; asangaih--who have no material attachment; justat--
which is enjoyed; grhe--to household life; niraya-vartmani--the path leading to hell; baddha-trsnan--
whose desires are bound.
TRANSLATION
Paramahamsas are exalted persons who have no taste for material enjoyment and who drink the honey
of the Lord's lotus feet. My dear servants, bring to me for punishment only persons who are averse to the
taste of that honey, who do not associate with paramahamsas and who are attached to family life and
worldly enjoyment, which form the path to hell.
PURPORT
After warning the Yamadutas not to approach the devotees, Yamaraja now indicates who is to be
brought before him. He specifically advises the Yamadutas to bring him the materialistic persons who are
attached to household life merely for sex. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, yan maithunadi-grhamedhisukham
hi tuccham: people are attached to household life for sex only. They are always harassed in many
ways by their material engagements, and their only happiness is that after working very hard all day, at
night they sleep and indulge in sex. Nidraya hriyate naktam vyavayena ca va vayah: at night, materialistic
householders sleep or indulge in sex life. Diva carthehaya rajan kutumba-bharanena va: during the day
they are busy trying to find out where money is, and if they get money they spend it to maintain their
families. Yamaraja specifically advises his servants to bring these persons to him for punishment and not
to bring the devotees, who always lick the honey at the lotus feet of the Lord, who are equal to everyone,
and who try to preach Krsna consciousness because of sympathy for all living entities. Devotees are not
liable to punishment by Yamaraja, but persons who have no information of Krsna consciousness cannot
be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment. Srimad-Bhagavatam says (2.1.4):
dehapatya-kalatradisv
atma-sainyesv asatsv api
tesam pramatto nidhanam
pasyann api na pasyati
Such persons complacently believe that their nations, communities or families can protect them,
unaware that all such fallible soldiers will be destroyed in due course of time. In conclusion, one should
try to associate with persons who engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day.
