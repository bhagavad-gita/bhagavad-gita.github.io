ya eka iso nija-mayaya nah

created; yena--by whom (through whose mercy); anusrjama--we also create; visvam--the universe;
vayam--we; na--not; yasya--of whom; api--although; purah--in front of us; samihatah--of Him who is

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His external potency and by whose mercy we
expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His
form. We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face
to face. Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Krsna or Lord Ramacandra and lives in human
society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him. Avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam: rascals (mudhas) deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an
ordinary human being. However insignificant we are, we think that we are also God, that we can create a
universe or that we can create another God. This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya says:
lingam eva pasyamah
kadacid abhimanas tu
devanam api sann iva
prayah kalesu nasty eva
taratamyena so 'pi tu
We are all conditioned to various degrees, but we think that we are God. This is why we cannot
understand who God is or see Him face to face.
