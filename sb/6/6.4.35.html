due to lamentation for the loss of his children; vimurcchitah--almost fainting; devarsim--the great
sage Devarsi Narada; upalabhya--seeing; aha--he said; rosat--out of great anger; visphurita--trembling;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When he heard that the Savalasvas had also left this world to engage in devotional service, Daksa was
angry at Narada, and he almost fainted due to lamentation. When Daksa met Narada, Daksa's lips began
trembling in anger, and he spoke as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that Narada Muni had delivered the entire family of
Svayambhuva Manu, beginning with Priyavrata and Uttanapada. He had delivered Uttanapada's son
Dhruva and had even delivered Pracinabarhi, who was engaged in fruitive activities. Nevertheless, he
could not deliver Prajapati Daksa. Prajapati Daksa saw Narada before him because Narada had personally
come to deliver him. Narada Muni took the opportunity to approach Prajapati Daksa in his bereavement
because the time of bereavement is a suitable time for appreciating bhakti-yoga. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(7.16), four kinds of men--arta (one who is distressed), artharthi (one in need of money), jijnasu (one
who is inquisitive) and jnani (a person in knowledge)--try to understand devotional service. Prajapati
Daksa was in great distress because of the loss of his sons, and therefore Narada took the opportunity to
instruct him regarding liberation from material bondage.
