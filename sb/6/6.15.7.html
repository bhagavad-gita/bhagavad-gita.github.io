<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva, whose hair is matted on his head, has certainly undergone great austerities and penances.
Indeed, he is the president in the assembly of strict followers of Vedic principles. Nonetheless, he is seated
with his wife on his lap in the midst of saintly persons and is embracing her as if he were a shameless,
ordinary human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Citraketu appreciated the exalted position of Lord Siva, and therefore he remarked at how wonderful it
was that Lord Siva was acting like an ordinary human being. He appreciated Lord Siva's position, but
when he saw Lord Siva sitting in the midst of saintly persons and acting like a shameless, ordinary man,
he was astonished. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that although Citraketu criticized Lord
Siva, he did not offend Lord Siva like Daksa. Daksa considered Lord Siva insignificant, but Citraketu
expressed his wonder at Lord Siva's being situated in that way.
