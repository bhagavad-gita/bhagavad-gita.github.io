because of killing the child; hata--having lost; prabhah--all bodily luster; bala-hatya-vratam--the

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Queen Krtyadyuti's co-wives, who had poisoned the child, were very much ashamed, and they lost all
their bodily luster. While lamenting, O King, they remembered the instructions of Angira and gave up
their ambition to bear children. Following the directions of the brahmanas, they went to the bank of the
Yamuna, where they bathed and atoned for their sinful activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word bala-hatya-hata-prabhah is to be particularly noted. The practice of killing
children has existed in human society for a long time--since time immemorial--but in the days of yore it
was very rarely performed. At the present moment, however, in this age of Kali, abortion--killing of the
child within the womb--has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth. If a
woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (bala-hatya-hataprabhah).
It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison
to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the brahmanas, they had to
undergo atonement for killing the child. Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful
act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that. Under the circumstances, the women responsible
must suffer in this life and the next. Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should
refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Krsna
consciousness very seriously. If one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra without offenses, all of one's
sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is
an offense.
