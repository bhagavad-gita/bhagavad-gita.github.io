<h2>Translation</h2>
A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vasudeva,
the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone's heart and is worshiped through the
various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers. Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as
the object of worship for a woman.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devata-bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is
offered without true understanding." The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and
cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as
various parts of the Lord. If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their
husbands as representatives of Vasudeva, the women benefit, just as Ajamila benefited by calling for
Narayana, his son. Ajamila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of
Narayana, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name. In India a husband is still called pati-guru,
the husband spiritual master. If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in Krsna
consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement. Although the
names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indraya svaha, agnaye svaha), the
Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Visnu. As long as one is very much
attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one's husband is
recommended.
