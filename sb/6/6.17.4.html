<h2>Text</h2>
alam te nirapeksaya
purna-kama namo 'stu te
mahavibhuti-pataye
namah sakala-siddhaye
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
alam--enough; te--to You; nirapeksaya--indifferent; purna-kama--O Lord, whose desire is always
fulfilled; namah--obeisances; astu--may there be; te--unto You; maha-vibhuti--of Laksmi; pataye--unto the
husband; namah--obeisances; sakala-siddhaye--unto the master of all mystic perfections.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[She should then pray to the Lord as follows.] My dear Lord, You are full in all opulences, but I do not
beg You for opulence. I simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You. You are the husband and master
of Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, who has all opulences. Therefore You are the master of all mystic
yoga. I simply offer my obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee knows how to appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
om purnam adah purnam idam
purnat purnam udacyate
purnasya purnam adaya
purnam evavasisyate
"The personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all
emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes.
Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself. Because He is the complete whole,
even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance." Therefore, to
take shelter of the Supreme Lord is required. Whatever a devotee needs will be supplied by the complete
Supreme Personality of Godhead (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham). Therefore a
pure devotee will not ask anything from the Lord. He simply offers the Lord his respectful obeisances, and
the Lord is prepared to accept whatever the devotee can secure to worship Him, even patram puspam
phalam toyam--a leaf, flower, fruit or water. There is no need to artificially exert oneself. It is better to be
plain and simple and with respectful obeisances offer to the Lord whatever one can secure. The Lord is
completely able to bless the devotee with all opulences.
