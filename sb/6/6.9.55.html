<h2>Text</h2>
tasmin vinihate yuyam
tejo-'strayudha-sampadah
bhuyah prapsyatha bhadram vo
na himsanti ca mat-paran
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmin--when he (Vrtrasura); vinihate--is killed; yuyam--all of you; tejah--power; astra--arrows;
ayudha--other weapons; sampadah--and opulence; bhuyah--again; prapsyatha--will obtain; bhadram--all
good fortune; vah--unto you; na--not; himsanti--hurt; ca--also; mat-paran--My devotees.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Vrtrasura is killed because of My spiritual strength, you will regain your strength, weapons and
wealth. Thus there will be all good fortune for all of you. Although Vrtrasura can destroy all the three
worlds, do not fear that he will harm you. He is also a devotee and will never be envious of you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee of the Lord is never envious of anyone, what to speak of other devotees. As revealed later,
Vrtrasura was also a devotee. Therefore be was not expected to be envious of the demigods. Indeed, of his
own accord, he would try to benefit the demigods. A devotee does not hesitate to give up his own body
for a better cause. Canakya Pandita said, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati. After all, all one's
material possessions, including his body, will be destroyed in due course of time. Therefore if the body
and other possessions can be utilized for a better cause, a devotee never hesitates to give up even his own
body. Because Lord Visnu wanted to save the demigods, Vrtrasura, even though able to swallow the three
worlds, would agree to be killed by the demigods. For a devotee there is no difference between living and
dying because in this life a devotee engages in devotional service, and after giving up his body, he engages
in the same service in the spiritual world. His devotional service is never hindered.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Ninth Chapter, Sixth Canto, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura."
Chapter Ten
The Battle Between the Demigods and Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a thunderbolt was prepared from
Dadhici's bones, and a fight took place between Vrtrasura and the demigods.
Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhici Muni
and begged for his body. Dadhici Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion,
jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after
death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals. Dadhici Muni first merged his gross
body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus
feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he gave up his gross body. With the help of
Visvakarma, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici's bones. Armed with the
thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.
At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga. a great fight took place between the demigods
and the asuras. Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle. leaving
Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself. Vrtrasura, however, seeing the demons fleeing,
instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield. One who is victorious in battle
gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial
heavens. In either way, the fighter benefits.
