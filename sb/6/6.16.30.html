prajapatih--Lord Brahma; striyam--the woman; cakre--created; sva-deha--of his body; ardham--half; yaya--
by whom; pumsam--of men; matih--the mind; hrta--carried away.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma, the father of the living entities of the universe, saw that all
the living entities were unattached. To increase population, he then created woman from the better half of
man's body, for woman's behavior carries away a man's mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This entire universe is going on under the spell of sexual attachment, which was created by Lord
Brahma to increase the population of the entire universe, not only in human society but also in other
species. As stated by Rsabhadeva in the Fifth Canto, pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam: the entire
world is going on under the spell of sexual attraction and desire between man and woman. When man
and woman unite, the hard knot of this attraction becomes increasingly tight, and thus a man is
implicated in the materialistic way of life. This is the illusion of the material world. This illusion acted
upon Kasyapa Muni, although he was very learned and advanced in spiritual knowledge. As stated in the
Manu-samhita (2.215) and Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.19.17) :
matra svasra duhitra va
naviviktasano bhavet
balavan indriya-gramo
vidvamsam api karsati
"A man should not associate with a woman in a solitary place, not even with his mother, sister or
daughter, for the senses are so strong that they lead astray even a person advanced in knowledge." When a
man remains in a solitary place with a woman, his sexual desires undoubtedly increase. Therefore the
words ekanta-bhutani, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the
company of women as far as possible. Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays
in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter.
