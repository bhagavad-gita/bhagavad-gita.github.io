Indra, the King of heaven; trailokya-laksmim--all the opulence of the three worlds; bubhuje--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Indra, who performed one hundred sacrifices, received this prayer of protection from Visvarupa.
After conquering the demons, he enjoyed all the opulences of the three worlds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This mystical mantric armor given by Visvarupa to Indra, the King of heaven, acted powerfully, with the
effect that Indra was able to conquer the asuras and enjoy the opulence of the three worlds without
impediments. In this regard, Madhvacarya points out:
vidyah karmani ca sada
guroh praptah phala-pradah
anyatha naiva phaladah
prasannoktah phala-pradah
One must receive all kinds of mantras from a bona fide spiritual master; otherwise the mantras will not
be fruitful. This is also indicated in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
All mantras should be received through the authorized guru, and the disciple must satisfy the guru in all
respects, after surrendering at his lotus feet. In the Padma Purana it is also said, sampradaya-vihina ye
mantras te nisphala matah. There are four sampradayas, or disciplic successions, namely the Brahmasampradaya,
the Rudra-sampradaya, the Sri sampradaya and the Kumara-sampradaya. If one wants to
advance in spiritual power, one must receive his mantras from one of these bona fide sampradayas;
otherwise he will never successfully advance in spiritual life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Narayana-kavaca Shield."
Chapter Nine
Appearance of the Demon Vrtrasura
As described in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, killed Visvarupa, and therefore Visvarupa's
father performed a yajna to kill Indra. When Vrtrasura appeared from that yajna, the demigods, in fear,
sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.
Because of affection for the demons, Visvarupa secretly supplied them the remnants of yajna. When
Indra learned about this, he beheaded Visvarupa, but he later regretted killing Visvarupa because
Visvarupa was a brahmana. Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana,
Indra did not do so. Instead he accepted the reactions. Later, he distributed these reactions among the
land, water, trees and women in general. Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, a
portion of the land turned into desert. The trees were also given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and
therefore they drip sap, which is prohibited for drinking. Because women accepted one fourth of the
sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period. Since water was also infested with
sinful reactions, when bubbles appear in water it cannot be used for any purpose.
After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed a sacrifice to kill King Indra. Unfortunately, if
mantras are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result. This happened when Tvasta performed this
yajna. While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra. Tvasta chanted a mantra to increase Indra's enemies,
but because he chanted the mantra wrong, the sacrifice produced an asura named Vrtrasura, of whom
Indra was the enemy. When Vrtrasura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole
world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods. Finding no other
means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of
all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe. The demigods all worshiped
Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger. Seeking shelter
of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross
the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog. A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the
ocean by grasping a dog's tail.
Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead advised them to approach
Dadhici to beg him for the bones of his own body. Dadhici would comply with the request of the
demigods, and with the help of his bones Vrtrasura could be killed.
