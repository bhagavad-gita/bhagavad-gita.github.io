<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, one's occupational duty is instructed in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita according
to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life. Those who follow their
occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving,
and not considering high and low, are called Aryans. Such Aryans worship You, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhagavata-dharma and krsna-katha are identical. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted everyone to become
a guru and preach the instructions of Krsna everywhere from Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, the
Puranas, Vedanta-sutra and similar Vedic literatures. Aryans, who are advanced in civilization, follow
bhagavata-dharma. Prahlada Maharaja, although merely a child of five years, recommended:
kaumara acaret prajno
dharman bhagavatan iha
durlabham manusam janma
tad apy adhruvam arthadam
(Bhag. 7.6.1)
Prahlada Maharaja preached bhagavata-dharma among his classmates as soon as an opportunity was
afforded by the absence of his teachers from the classroom. He said that from the very beginning of life,
from the age of five, children should be instructed about bhagavata-dharma because the human form of
life, which is very rarely obtained, is meant for understanding this subject.
Bhagavata-dharma means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
Bhagavad-gita we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. Again, the Puranas and other Vedic literatures set forth four
asramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life. Therefore bhagavata-dharma means the varnasramadharma
of the four social and four spiritual divisions.
The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of bhagavata-dharma and live
according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called Aryans or arya. A
civilization of Aryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those
instructions is perfect. Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and
other living entities. panditah sama-darsinah: because they are completely educated in Krsna
consciousness, they see all living beings equally. Aryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not
to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification. At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is
prominent. Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also,
all for sense gratification. This is not an Aryan civilization. As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambesv
aprthag-dhiyah. The word aprthag-dhiyah indicates that Aryans do not distinguish between lower and
higher grades of life. All life should be protected. All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and
plants. This is the basic principle of an Aryan civilization. Apart from the lower living entities, those who
have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of brahmanas, ksatriyas,
vaisyas and sudras. The brahmanas should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
as stated in Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures. The criterion must be guna and karma. In other
words, one should acquire the qualities of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and act accordingly. This
is the civilization accepted by the Aryans. Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very
much eager to satisfy Krsna. This is perfect civilization.
Aryans do not deviate from the instructions of Krsna, nor do they have doubts about Krsna, but non-
Aryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living
entities. Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden
activities for sense gratification. Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: they deviate in this way because they want to
gratify their senses. They have no other occupation or ambition. Their method of civilization is
condemned in the previous verse. Kah ksemo nija-parayoh kiyan varthah sva-para-druha dharmena:
"What is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others?"
This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the Aryan civilization and accept the
instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should conduct his social, political and religious
affairs according to His instructions. We are spreading the Krsna consciousness movement to try to
establish a society the way that Krsna wants it. This is the meaning of Krsna consciousness. We are
therefore presenting Bhagavad-gita as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction. Fools and
rascals interpret Bhagavad-gita in their own way. When Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto madyaji
mam namaskuru--"Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto
Me"--they comment that it is not Krsna to whom we must surrender. Thus they derive imaginary
meanings from Bhagavad-gita. The Krsna consciousness movement, however, strictly follows bhagavatadharma,
the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam for the complete welfare of human
society. One who misinterprets Bhagavad-gita, twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a
non-Aryan. Therefore commentaries on Bhagavad-gita by such persons should be immediately rejected.
One should try to follow Bhagavad-gita as it is. In Bhagavad-gita (12.6-7) Lord Sri Krsna says:
ye tu sarvani karmani
mayi sannyasya mat-parah
ananyenaiva yogena
mam dhyayanta upasate
tesam aham samuddharta
mrtyu-samsara-sagarat
bhavami na cirat partha
mayy avesita-cetasam
"For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without
deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon
Me, O son of Prtha, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death."
