<h2>Text</h2>
nettham pumsam viragah syat
tvaya kevalina mrsa
manyase yady upasamam
sneha-pasa-nikrntanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; ittham--in this way; pumsam--of persons; viragah--renunciation; syat--is possible; tvaya--by
you; kevalina mrsa--possessing knowledge falsely; manyase--you think; yadi--if; upasamam--renunciation
of material enjoyment; sneha-pasa--the bonds of affection; nikrntanam--cutting.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prajapati Daksa continued: If you think that simply awakening the sense of renunciation will detach one
from the material world, I must say that unless full knowledge is awakened, simply changing dresses as
you have done cannot possibly bring detachment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prajapati Daksa was correct in stating that changing one's dress cannot detach one from this material
world. The sannyasis of Kali-yuga who change their robes from white to saffron and then think they can
do whatever they like are more abominable than materialistic grhasthas. This is not recommended
anywhere. Prajapati Daksa was right in pointing out this defect, but he did not know that Narada Muni
had aroused the spirit of renunciation in the Haryasvas and Savalasvas through full knowledge. Such
enlightened renunciation is desirable. One should enter the renounced order with full knowledge (jnanavairagya),
for the perfection of life is possible for one who renounces this material world in that way. This
elevated stage can be reached very easily, as supported by the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires
causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." If one seriously engages in devotional service to
Lord Vasudeva, jnana and vairagya are automatically manifest in one's person. There is no doubt of this.
Prajapati Daksa's accusation that Narada had not actually elevated his sons to the platform of knowledge
was not factual. All the sons of Prajapati Daksa had first been raised to the platform of jnana and had then
automatically renounced this world. In summary, unless one's knowledge is awakened, renunciation
cannot take place, for without elevated knowledge one cannot give up attachment for material enjoyment.
