<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Suta Gosvami said: O great sage Saunaka, after hearing Maharaja Pariksit speak respectfully and
briefly on topics essential to hear, Sukadeva Gosvami, who was well aware of everything, praised his
endeavor with great pleasure and replied.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit's question was very much appreciated by Sukadeva Gosvami because although it was
composed of a small number of words, it contained meaningful inquiries about how the sons of Diti,
although born as demons, became demigods. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura stresses that even
though Diti was very envious, her heart was purified because of a devotional attitude. Another significant
topic is that although Kasyapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness,
he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife. All these questions were posed in a
small number of words, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated Maharaja Pariksit's
inquiry.
