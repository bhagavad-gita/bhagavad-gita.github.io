<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, in former days Lord Siva and other demigods took shelter of the lotus feet of Sankarsana.
Thus they immediately got free from the illusion of duality and achieved unequaled and unsurpassed
glories in spiritual life. You will very soon attain that very same position.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Saints Narada and Angira Instruct King Citraketu."
Chapter Sixteen
King Citraketu Meets the Supreme Lord
As related in this chapter, Citraketu was able to talk with his dead son and hear from him the truth of
life. When Citraketu was appeased, the great sage Narada gave him a mantra, and by chanting this mantra
Citraketu found shelter at the lotus feet of Sankarsana.
The living entity is eternal. Thus he has neither birth nor death (na hanyate hanyamane sarire).
According to the reactions of one's fruitive activities, one takes birth in various species of life among the
birds, beasts, trees, human beings, demigods and so on, thus rotating through various bodies. For a
certain period of time, one receives a particular type of body as a son or father in a false relationship. All
our relationships in this material world with friends, relatives or enemies consist of duality, in which one
feels happy and distressed on the basis of illusion. The living entity is actually a spiritual soul who is part
and parcel of God and has nothing to do with relationships in the world of duality. Therefore Narada
Muni advised Citraketu not to lament for his so-called dead son.
After hearing instructions from their dead child, Citraketu and his wife could understand that all
relationships in this material world are causes of misery. The queens who had administered poison to the
son of Krtadyuti were very much ashamed. They atoned for the sinful act of killing a child and gave up
their aspiration to have sons. Thereafter. Narada Muni chanted prayers to Narayana, who exists as caturvyuha,
and instructed Citraketu about the Supreme Lord, who creates, maintains and annihilates
everything and who is the master of the material nature. After instructing King Citraketu in this way, he
returned to Brahmaloka. These instructions about the Absolute Truth are called the maha-vidya. After
being initiated by Narada Muni, King Citraketu chanted the maha-vidya, and after one week he attained
the presence of Lord Sankarsana, who was surrounded by the four Kumaras. The Lord was nicely dressed
in bluish garments, with a helmet and ornaments of gold. His face appeared very happy. In the presence of
Lord Sankarsana, Citraketu offered his obeisances and began to offer prayers.
In his prayers, Citraketu said that millions of universes rest in the pores of Sankarsana, who is limitless,
having no beginning and end. The Lord is well known to the devotees for His eternity. The difference
between worshiping the Lord and worshiping the demigods is that the worshiper of the Lord also
becomes eternal, whereas whatever benedictions one can get from the demigods are impermanent. Unless
one becomes a devotee, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
After Citraketu finished his prayers, the unlimited Supreme Lord explained knowledge of Himself to
Citraketu.
