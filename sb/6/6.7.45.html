<h2>Text</h2>
hamsaya dahra-nilayaya niriksakaya
krsnaya mrsta-yasase nirupakramaya

ante parista-gataye haraye namas te
<p></p>

hamsaya--unto the most exalted and pure (pavitram paramam, the supreme pure); dahra--in the core of
the heart; nilayaya--whose abode; niriksakaya--supervising the activities of the individual soul; krsnaya--
unto the Supersoul, who is a partial manifestation of Krsna; mrsta-yasase--whose reputation is very bright;
nirupakramaya--who has no beginning; sat-sangrahaya--understood only by pure devotees; bhava-panthanija-
asrama-aptau--being obtainment of the shelter of Krsna for persons within this material world; ante--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, O supreme pure, You live within the core of everyone's heart and observe all the desires and
activities of the conditioned souls. O Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Lord Krsna, Your
reputation is bright and illuminating. You have no beginning, for You are the beginning of everything.
This is understood by pure devotees because You are easily accessible to the pure and truthful. When the
conditioned souls are liberated and sheltered at Your lotus feet after roving throughout the material world
for many millions of years, they attain the highest success of life. Therefore, O Lord, O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, we offer our respectful obeisances at Your lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demigods certainly wanted Lord Visnu to relieve their anxiety, but now they directly approach Lord
Krsna, for although there is no difference between Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu, Krsna descends to this
planet in His Vasudeva feature for the purpose of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--protecting
His devotees and annihilating the miscreants. Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or
devotees, and therefore Krsna descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His
devotees. Krsna, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Visnu and
Narayana, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord. As explained in
Brahma-samhita (5.46):
diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya
dipayate vivrta-hetu-samana-dharma
yas tadrg eva hi ca visnutaya vibhati
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Krsna expands Himself as Visnu the way a bright candle kindles another. Although there is no
difference between the power of one candle and another, Krsna is compared to the original candle.
The word mrsta-yasase is significant herein because Krsna is always famous for relieving His devotee
from danger. A devotee who has sacrificed everything for the service of Krsna and whose only source of
relief is the Lord is known as akincana.
As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kunti, the Lord is akincana-vitta, the property of such a
devotee. Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world,
where they achieve five kinds of liberation--sayujya, salokya, sarupya, sarsti and samipya. They personally
associate with the Lord in five mellows--santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya. These rasas are all
emanations from Krsna. As described by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the original mellow, adi-rasa, is
conjugal love. Krsna is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love.
