<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
athainam mapanayata
krtasesagha-niskrtam
yad asau bhagavan-nama
mriyamanah samagrahit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--therefore; enam--him (Ajamila); ma--do not; apanayata--try to take; krta--already done; asesa--
unlimited; agha-niskrtam--atonement for his sinful actions; yat--because; asau--he; bhagavat-nama--the
holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; mriyamanah--while dying; samagrahit--perfectly
chanted.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
At the time of death, this Ajamila helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of the Lord,
Narayana. That chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life. Therefore, O
servants of Yamaraja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish conditions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Visnudutas, who are superior authorities, gave orders to the Yamadutas, who did not know that
Ajamila was no longer subject to tribulation in hellish life for his past sins. Although he had chanted the
holy name Narayana to indicate his son, the holy name is so transcendentally powerful that he was
automatically freed because he had chanted the holy name while dying (ante narayana-smrtih). As Krsna
confirms in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." Unless one is freed from all sinful reactions, one cannot be promoted to the platform of
devotional service. Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (8.5) it is stated:
anta-kale ca mam eva
smaran muktva kalevaram
yah prayati sa mad-bhavam
yati nasty atra samsayah
If one remembers Krsna, Narayana, at the time of death, one is certainly eligible to return immediately
home, back to Godhead.
