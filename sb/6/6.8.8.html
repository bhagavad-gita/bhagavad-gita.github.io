iheta bhuta-dayaya
sa socyah sthavarair api
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

religious principles; na--not; yasah--fame; puman--a person; iheta--endeavors for; bhuta-dayaya--by mercy

<h2>Translation</h2>
O demigods, one who has no compassion for humanity in its suffering and does not sacrifice his
impermanent body for the higher causes of religious principles or eternal glory is certainly pitied even by
the immovable beings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis of
Vrndavana. Concerning Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.34):
tyaktva sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmim
dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam
maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad
vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam
"We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord. upon whom one should always
meditate. He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of
heaven adore. He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material
energy." To accept sannyasa means to commit civil suicide. but sannyasa is compulsory, at least for every
brahmana, every first-class human being. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife
and a very affectionate mother. Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing
that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home. Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all
the fallen souls of the world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa and left home when He was only
twenty-four years old. He lived a very strict life as a sannyasi, refusing all bodily comforts. Similarly, His
disciples the six Gosvamis were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left
everything to join the movement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Srinivasa Acarya says:
tyaktva turnam asesa-mandala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat
bhutva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-kanthasritau
These Gosvamis left their very comfortable lives as ministers. Zamindars and learned scholars and
joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (dinaganesakau
karunaya). Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and
torn quilts (kaupina-kantha). they lived in Vrndavana and followed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's order to
excavate Vrndavana's lost glories.
Similarly. everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the Krsna
consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls. The words bhuta-dayaya, maya-mrgam
dayitayepsitam and dina-ganesakau karunaya all convey the same sense. These are very significant words
for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life. One should join the
Krsna consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, the six Gosvamis and, before them, the great sage Dadhici. Instead of wasting one's life for
temporary bodily comforts. one should always be prepared to give up one's life for better causes. After all,
the body will be destroyed. Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious
principles throughout the world.
