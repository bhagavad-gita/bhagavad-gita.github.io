<h2>Translation</h2>
The order carriers of Yamaraja said: Your eyes are just like the petals of lotus flowers. Dressed in yellow
silken garments, decorated with garlands of lotuses, and wearing very attractive helmets on your heads
and earrings on your ears, you all appear fresh and youthful. Your four long arms are decorated with bows
and quivers of arrows and with swords, clubs, conchshells, discs and lotus flowers. Your effulgence has
dissipated the darkness of this place with extraordinary illumination. Now, sirs, why are you obstructing
us?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Before even being introduced to a foreigner, one becomes acquainted with him through his dress, bodily
features and behavior and can thus understand his position. Therefore when the Yamadutas saw the
Visnudutas for the first time, they were surprised. They said, "By your bodily features you appear to be
very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this
material world with your own effulgences. Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our
duty?" It will be explained that the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, mistakenly considered
Ajamila sinful. They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified
by constantly chanting the holy name of Narayana. In other words, unless one is a Vaisnava, one cannot
understand the activities of a Vaisnava.
The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaikunthaloka are properly described in these verses.
The residents of Vaikuntha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms
holding various weapons. Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Visnu. They have the same bodily
features as Narayana because they have attained the liberation of sarupya, but they nevertheless act as
servants. All the residents of Vaikunthaloka know perfectly well that their master is Narayana, or Krsna,
and that they are all His servants. They are all self-realized souls who are nitya-mukta, everlastingly
liberated. Although they could conceivably declare themselves Narayana or Visnu, they never do so; they
always remain Krsna conscious and serve the Lord faithfully. Such is the atmosphere of Vaikunthaloka.
Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord Krsna through the Krsna consciousness movement
will always remain in Vaikunthaloka and have nothing to do with the material world.
