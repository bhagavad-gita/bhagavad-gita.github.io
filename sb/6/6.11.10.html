sri-suka uvaca

marutvan ahanad ripum
brahma-hatya hate tasminn
asasada vrsakapim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam--thus; sancoditah--being encouraged; vipraih--by the
brahmanas; marutvan--Indra; ahanat--killed; ripum--his enemy, Vrtrasura; brahma-hatya--the sinful
reaction for killing a brahmana; hate--was killed; tasmin--when he (Vrtrasura); asasada--approached;
vrsakapim--Indra, who is also named Vrsakapi.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Encouraged by the words of the sages, Indra killed Vrtrasura, and when he
was killed the sinful reaction for killing a brahmana [brahma-hatya] certainly took shelter of Indra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After killing Vrtrasura, Indra could not surpass the brahma-hatya, the sinful reactions for killing a
brahmana. Formerly he had killed one brahmana, Visvarupa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time,
following the advice of the sages, he killed another brahmana purposely. Therefore the sinful reaction was
greater than before. Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for
atonement. He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering,
the brahmanas allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice. The planned execution of sinful deeds on the
strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing prayascitta, atonement, cannot give relief to
anyone, even to Indra or Nahusa. Nahusa was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was
going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.
