<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
ity uktva misatas tasya
bhagavan visva-bhavanah
svapnopalabdhartha iva
tatraivantardadhe harih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak; iti--thus; uktva--saying; misatah tasya--while
he (Daksa) was personally looking on; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; visva-bhavanah--
who creates the universal affairs; svapna-upalabdha-arthah--an object obtained in dreaming; iva--like;
tatra--there; eva--certainly; antardadhe--disappeared; harih--the Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: After the creator of the entire universe, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Hari, had spoken in this way in the presence of Prajapati Daksa, He immediately disappeared as
if He were an object experienced in a dream.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Hamsa-guhya Prayers Offered to the Lord by Prajapati Daksa."
Chapter Five
Narada Muni Cursed by Prajapati Daksa
This chapter relates how all the sons of Daksa were delivered from the clutches of the material energy
by following the advice of Narada, who was therefore cursed by Daksa.
Influenced by the external energy of Lord Visnu, Prajapati Daksa begot ten thousand sons in the womb
of his wife, Pancajani. These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the
Haryasvas. Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Haryasvas went west to the
place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea. In those days this was the site of a
holy lake named Narayana-saras, where there were many saintly persons. The Haryasvas began practicing
austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of
life. However, when Srila Narada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply
for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency. Narada Muni described to
the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary karmis to beget children.
Thus all the sons of Daksa became enlightened and left, never to return.
Prajapati Daksa, who was very sad at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of
his wife, Pancajani, and ordered them to increase progeny. These sons, who were named the Savalasvas,
also engaged in worshiping Lord Visnu to beget children, but Narada Muni convinced them to become
mendicants and not beget children. Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Prajapati Daksa
became most angry at Narada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay
anywhere. Since Narada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Daksa's curse.
