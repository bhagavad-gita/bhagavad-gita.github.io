sri-bhagavan uvaca
yan naradangirobhyam te
vyahrtam me 'nusasanam
samsiddho 'si taya rajan
vidyaya darsanac ca me
SYNONYMS
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sankarsana, replied; yat--which; naradaangirobhyam--
by the great sages Narada and Angira; te--unto you; vyahrtam--spoken; me--of Me;
anusasanam--the worship; samsiddhah--completely perfected; asi--you are; taya--by that; rajan--O King;
vidyaya--mantra; darsanat--from the direct sight; ca--as well as; me--of Me.
TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Anantadeva, replied as follows: O King, as a result of your having
accepted the instructions spoken about Me by the great sages Narada and Angira, you have become
completely aware of transcendental knowledge. Because you are now educated in the spiritual science,
you have seen Me face to face. Therefore you are now completely perfect.
PURPORT
The perfection of life is to be spiritually educated and to understand the existence of the Lord and how
He creates, maintains and annihilates the cosmic manifestation. When one is perfect in knowledge, he can
develop his love of Godhead through the association of such perfect persons as Narada and Angira and
the members of their disciplic succession. Then one is able to see the unlimited Supreme Personality of
Godhead face to face. Although the Lord is unlimited, by His causeless mercy He becomes visible to the
devotee, who is then able to see Him. In our present position of conditioned life we cannot see or
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
"No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Sri Krsna
through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by
transcendental service to the Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord
revealed to him." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234) If one takes to spiritual life under the direction of
Narada Muni or his representative and thus engages himself in the service of the Lord, he qualifies himself
to see the Lord face to face. The Brahma-samhita (5.38) states:
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with
the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara situated within the heart of the devotee."
One must follow the instructions of the spiritual master. Thus one becomes qualified and later sees the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, as evinced by Maharaja Citraketu.
