<h2>Translation</h2>
Once this brahmana Ajamila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers
and two kinds of grass, called samit and kusa. On the way home, he came upon a sudra, a very lusty,
fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute. The sudra was smiling,
singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior. Both the sudra and the prostitute were drunk. The
prostitute's eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose. Such was the condition in
which Ajamila saw them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
While traveling along the public way, Ajamila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are
vividly described here. Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very
frequently. In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world
have become shameless. Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken sudra and the prostitute,
Ajamila, who was a perfect brahmacari, was affected. Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and
we must consider the position of a brahmacari student who sees such behavior. For such a brahmacari to
remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles.
Nevertheless, if one takes to Krsna consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created
by sin. In our Krsna consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and
gambling. In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight,
especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult.
Nevertheless, if by the grace of Krsna one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare Krsna
mantra, Krsna will certainly protect him. Indeed, Krsna says that His devotee is never vanquished
(kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). Therefore all the disciples practicing Krsna
consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy
name of the Lord. Then there need be no fear. Otherwise one's position is very dangerous, especially in
this Kali-yuga.
