austerities to fulfill his desires. One day, when the great sage Narada saw those boys performing such fine
austerities to increase the population, Narada approached them.

TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada said: My dear Haryasvas, you have not seen the extremities of the earth. There is
a kingdom where only one man lives and where there is a hole from which, having entered, no one
emerges. A woman there who is extremely unchaste adorns herself with various attractive dresses, and the
man who lives there is her husband. In that kingdom, there is a river flowing in both directions, a
wonderful home made of twenty-five materials, a swan that vibrates various sounds, and an automatically
revolving object made of sharp razors and thunderbolts. You have not seen all this, and therefore you are
inexperienced boys without advanced knowledge. How, then, will you create progeny?
PURPORT
Narada Muni saw that the boys known as the Haryasvas were already purified because of living in that
holy place and were practically ready for liberation. Why then should they be encouraged to become
entangled in family life, which is so dark that once having entered it one cannot leave it? Through this
analogy, Narada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father's order to be entangled
in family life. Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the
Supersoul, Lord Visnu, for then they would truly be experienced. In other words, one who is too involved
in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the
illusory energy. Narada Muni's purpose was to get the sons of Prajapati Daksa to divert their attention
toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of
propagation. The same advice was given by Prahlada Maharaja to his father (Bhag. 7.5.5):
tat sadhu manye 'sura-varya dehinam
sada samudvigna-dhiyam asad-grahat
hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam
vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta
In the dark well of family life, one is always full of anxiety because of having accepted a temporary
body. If one wants to free himself from this anxiety, one should immediately leave family life and take
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana. Narada Muni advised the Haryasvas not to
enter household life. Since they were already advanced in spiritual knowledge, why should they be
entangled in that way?
