<h2>Text</h2>
ity atad-virya-vidusi
bruvane bahv-asobhanam
rusaha devi dhrstaya
nirjitatmabhimanine
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; a-tat-virya-vidusi--when Citraketu, who did not know the prowess of Lord Siva; bruvane--
spoke; bahu-asobhanam--that which is not up to the standard of etiquette (the criticism of the exalted
Lord Siva); rusa--with anger; aha--said; devi--the goddess Parvati; dhrstaya--unto Citraketu, who was
quite shameless; nirjita-atma--as one who has controlled his senses; abhimanine--thinking of himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Not knowing the prowess of Lord Siva and Parvati, Citraketu strongly criticized them. His statements
were not at all pleasing, and therefore the goddess Parvati, being very angry, spoke as follows to
Citraketu, who thought himself better than Lord Siva in controlling the senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although Citraketu never meant to insult Lord Siva, he should not have criticized the lord, even though
the lord was transgressing social customs. It is said, tejiyasam na dosaya: one who is very powerful should
be understood to be faultless. For example, one should not find faults with the sun, although it evaporates
urine from the street. The most powerful cannot be criticized by an ordinary man, or even by a great
personality. Citraketu should have known that Lord Siva, although sitting in that way, was not to be
criticized. The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee of Lord Visnu, Sankarsana,
was somewhat proud at having achieved Lord Sankarsana's favor and therefore thought that he could now
criticize anyone, even Lord Siva. This kind of pride in a devotee is never tolerated. A Vaisnava should
always remain very humble and meek and offer respect to others.
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
"One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the
straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready
to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly."
A Vaisnava should not try to minimize anyone else's position. It is better to remain humble and meek and
chant the Hare Krsna mantra. The word nirjitatmabhimanine indicates that Citraketu thought himself a
better controller of the senses than Lord Siva, although actually he was not. Because of all these
considerations, mother Parvati was somewhat angry at Citraketu.
