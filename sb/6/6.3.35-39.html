<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is extremely affectionate to
His devotees, was very pleased by the prayers offered by Daksa, and thus He appeared at that holy place
known as Aghamarsana. O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Kuru dynasty, the Lord's lotus feet rested on the
shoulders of His carrier, Garuda, and He appeared with eight long, mighty, very beautiful arms. In His
hands He held a disc, conchshell, sword, shield, arrow, bow, rope and club--in each hand a different
weapon, all brilliantly shining. His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish. His eyes and
face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers. His chest was
decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of Srivatsa. On His head was a gorgeous round helmet,
and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks. All these ornaments were uncommonly
beautiful. The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle
bells on His feet. Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living
entities of the three worlds, is known as Purusottama, the best personality. He was accompanied by great
devotees like Narada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the
residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and Caranaloka. Situated
on both sides of the Lord and behind Him as well, these devotees offered Him prayers continuously.
