<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Not a single living entity can remain unengaged even for a moment. One must act by his natural
tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this natural tendency forcibly makes
him work in a particular way.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The svabhavika, or one's natural tendency, is the most important factor in action. One's natural
tendency is to serve because a living entity is an eternal servant of God. The living entity wants to serve,
but because of his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord, he serves under the modes of
material nature and manufactures various modes of service, such as socialism, humanitarianism and
altruism. However, one should be enlightened in the tenets of Bhagavad-gita and accept the instruction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one give up all natural tendencies for material service under
different names and take to the service of the Lord. One's original natural tendency is to act in Krsna
consciousness because one's real nature is spiritual. The duty of a human being is to understand that since
he is essentially spirit, he must abide by the spiritual tendency and not be carried away by material
tendencies. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung:
(miche) mayara vase, yaccha bhese',
khaccha habudubu, bhai
"My dear brothers, you are being carried away by the waves of material energy and are suffering in many
miserable conditions. Sometimes you are drowning in the waves of material nature, and sometimes you
are tossed like a swimmer struggling in the ocean." As confirmed by Bhaktivinoda Thakura, this tendency
to be battered by the waves of maya can be changed to one's original, natural tendency, which is spiritual,
when the living entity comes to understand that he is eternally krsna-dasa, a servant of God, Krsna.
(jiva) krsna-dasa, ei visvasa,
karle ta' ara duhkha nai
If instead of serving maya under different names, one turns his service attitude toward the Supreme
Lord, he is then safe, and there is no more difficulty. If one returns to his original, natural tendency in the
human form of life by understanding the perfect knowledge given by Krsna Himself in the Vedic
literature, one's life is successful.
