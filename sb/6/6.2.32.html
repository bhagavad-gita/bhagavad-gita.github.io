<h2>Text</h2>
athapi me durbhagasya
vibudhottama-darsane
bhavitavyam mangalena
yenatma me prasidati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--therefore; api--although; me--of me; durbhagasya--so unfortunate; vibudha-uttama--exalted
devotees; darsane--because of seeing; bhavitavyam--there must be; mangalena--auspicious activities;
yena--by which; atma--self; me--my; prasidati--actually becomes happy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I am certainly most abominable and unfortunate to have merged in an ocean of sinful activities, but
nevertheless, because of my previous spiritual activities, I could see those four exalted personalities who
came to rescue me. Now I feel exceedingly happy because of their visit.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.54):
'sadhu-sanga', 'sadhu-sanga'----sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya
"Association with devotees is recommended by all the sastras because by even a moment of such
association one can receive the seed for all perfection." In the beginning of his life Ajamila was certainly
very pure, and he associated with devotees and brahmanas; because of that pious activity, even though he
was fallen, he was inspired to name his son Narayana. Certainly this was due to good counsel given from
within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham
hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." The Lord, who is situated in everyone's heart, is so kind that
if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him. Thus the Lord, from within, gave
Ajamila the opportunity to name his youngest son Narayana so that in affection he would constantly call
"Narayana! Narayana!" and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of
his death. Such is the mercy of Krsna. Guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija: by the mercy of the guru
and Krsna, one receives the seed of bhakti. This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear. In our
Krsna consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee's name to a form that reminds him of
Visnu. If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as Krsnadasa or Govinda
dasa, he can be saved from the greatest danger. Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is
essential. The Krsna consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to
remember Krsna somehow or other.
