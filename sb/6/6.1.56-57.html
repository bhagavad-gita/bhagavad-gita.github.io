<h2>Translation</h2>
In the beginning this brahmana named Ajamila studied all the Vedic literatures. He was a reservoir of
good character, good conduct and good qualities. Firmly established in executing all the Vedic
injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control. Furthermore, he
was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure. Ajamila was
very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire-god, guests, and the elderly members of his household.
Indeed, he was free from false prestige. He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved.
He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The order carriers of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety
and how a living entity is entangled in this material world. Describing the history of Ajamila's life, the
Yamadutas relate that in the beginning he was a learned scholar of the Vedic literature. He was well
behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone. In fact, he had all good qualities. In other words, he
was like a perfect brahmana. A brahmana is expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative
principles and to have all good qualities. The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses. Srila
Viraraghava Acarya comments that dhrta-vrata means dhrtam vratam stri-sanga-rahityatmakabrahmacarya-
rupam. In other words, Ajamila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfect
brahmacari and was very softhearted, truthful, clean and pure. How he fell down in spite of all these
qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamaraja will be described in the following
verses.
