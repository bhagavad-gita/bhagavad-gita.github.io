<h2>Text</h2>
evam tvam niranukroso
balanam mati-bhid dhareh
parsada-madhye carasi
yaso-ha nirapatrapah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; tvam--you (Narada); niranukrosah--without compassion; balanam--of innocent,
inexperienced boys; mati-bhit--contaminating the consciousness; hareh--of the Supreme personality of
Godhead; parsada-madhye--among the personal associates; carasi--travel; yasah-ha--defaming the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; nirapatrapah--(although you do not know what you are doing, you are
executing sinful activities) without shame.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prajapati Daksa continued: Thus committing violence against other living entities and yet claiming to be
an associate of Lord Visnu, you are defaming the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You needlessly created
a mentality of renunciation in innocent boys, and therefore you are shameless and devoid of compassion.
How could you travel with the personal associates of the Supreme Lord ?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This mentality of Prajapati Daksa still continues even today. When young boys join the Krsna
consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the
Krsna consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to
deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking. Karmis, fruitive
workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some
pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life. A yogi,
however, especially a bhakti-yogi, is callous to the opinions of this material world. He is not interested in
traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic
civilization. As stated by Prabodhananda Sarasvati, kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate: for
a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the
demigods is a will-o'-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all. A pure devotee is not
interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman. He is
interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead. Since Prajapati Daksa was a karmi, he
could not appreciate the great service Narada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons. Instead, he
accused Narada Muni of being sinful and charged that because Narada Muni was associated with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed. Thus Daksa criticized that Narada
Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.
