<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhagavata-dharma work under conceptions of
fruitive results and distinctions of "you and I" and "yours and mine." The followers of Srimad-
Bhagavatam have no such consciousness. They are all Krsna conscious, thinking that they are Krsna's and
Krsna is theirs. There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of
enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are
impure and temporary. Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhagavata-dharma has no contradictions. Conceptions of "your religion" and "my religion" are
completely absent from bhagavata-dharma. Bhagavata-dharma means following the orders given by the
Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, as stated in Bhagavad-gita: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja.
God is one, and God is for everyone. Therefore everyone must surrender to God. That is the pure
conception of religion. Whatever God orders constitutes religion (dharmam tu saksad bhagavatpranitam).
In bhagavata-dharma there is no question of "what you believe" and "what I believe."
Everyone must believe in the Supreme Lord and carry out His orders. Anukulyena krsnanusilanam:
whatever Krsna says--whatever God says--should be directly carried out. That is dharma, religion.
If one is actually Krsna conscious, he cannot have any enemies. Since his only engagement is to induce
others to surrender to Krsna, or God, how can he have enemies? If one advocates the Hindu religion, the
Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts. History shows
that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another.
There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon
service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy. There are
many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of "my
belief" and "your belief." Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him. That is bhagavatadharma.
Bhagavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is
connected with Krsna (isavasyam idam sarvam). According to the Vedic injunctions, sarvam khalv idam
brahma: Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything. Bhagavata-dharma captures this presence of the
Supreme. Bhagavata-dharma does not consider everything in the world to be false. Because everything
emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme.
For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we
are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman. Since we are using this machine
in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman. This is the meaning of sarvam khalv idam brahma. Everything is
Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is mithya, false;
everything is factual.
Bhagavata-dharma is called sarvotkrsta, the best of all religious systems, because those who follow
bhagavata-dharma are not envious of anyone. Pure bhagavatas, pure devotees, invite everyone, without
envy, to join the Krsna consciousness movement. A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Suhrdam sarva-bhutanam: he is the friend of all living entities. Therefore this is
the best of all religious systems. Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who
believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in Krsna consciousness, or bhagavatadharma.
If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure.
