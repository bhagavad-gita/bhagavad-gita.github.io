<h2>Translation</h2>
Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all
the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Parvati might naturally have inquired how devotees become so exalted. Therefore this verse explains
that they are narayana-para, simply dependent on Narayana. They do not mind reverses in life because in
the service of Narayana they have learned to tolerate whatever hardships there may be. They do not care
whether they are in heaven or in hell: they simply engage in the service of the Lord. This is their
excellence. Anukulyena krsnanusilanam: they are liberally engaged in the service of the Lord, and
therefore they are excellent. By using the word bhrtya-bhrtyanam, Lord Siva pointed out that although
Citraketu provided one example of tolerance and excellence, all the devotees who have taken shelter of
the Lord as eternal servants are glorious. They have no eagerness to be happy by being placed in the
heavenly planets, becoming liberated or becoming one with Brahman, the supreme effulgence. These
benefits do not appeal to their minds. They are simply interested in giving direct service to the Lord.
