<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Vrtrasura continued: O Indra, no one is guaranteed of being always victorious but the original enjoyer,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan. He is the cause of creation, maintenance and
annihilation, and He knows everything. Being dependent and being obliged to accept material bodies,
belligerent subordinates are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." When
two parties fight, the fighting actually goes on under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is Paramatma, the Supersoul. Elsewhere in the Gita (3.27) the Lord says:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." The living entities work only under the
direction of the Supreme Lord. The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she arranges facilities for the
living entities. The living entities are not independent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers
(karta).
Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As for the subordinate living entities, they
fight under the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Victory or defeat is not actually
theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature. Pride in victory, or
moroseness in defeat, is useless. One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities. The Lord advises, niyatam kuru karma tvam
karma jyayo hy akarmanah: "Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction." The living
entity is ordered to act according to his position. Victory or defeat depends on the Supreme Lord.
Karmany evadhikaras te ma phalesu kadacana: "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you
are not entitled to the fruits of actions." One must act sincerely, according to his position. Victory or
defeat depends on the Lord.
Vrtrasura encouraged Indra, saying, "Don't be morose because of my victory. There is no need to stop
fighting. Instead, you should go on with your duty. When Krsna desires, you will certainly be victorious."
This verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the Krsna consciousness movement. We should not be
jubilant in victory or morose in defeat. We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of Krsna, or
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat. Our only duty is to
work sincerely, so that our activities may be recognized by Krsna.
