<h2>Text</h2>
kama-dhiyas tvayi racita
na parama rohanti yatha karambha-bijani
jnanatmany agunamaye
guna-ganato 'sya dvandva-jalani
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kama-dhiyah--desires for sense gratification; tvayi--in You; racitah--performed; na--not; parama--O
Supreme Personality of Godhead; rohanti--do grow (produce other bodies); yatha--just as; karambhabijani--
sterilized or fried seeds; jnana-atmani--in You, whose existence is in full knowledge; aguna-maye--
who is not affected by the material qualities; guna-ganatah--from the material qualities; asya--of a person;
dvandva-jalani--the networks of duality.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material
opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities,
they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants. Living
entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature,
but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the
conditions of material nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), wherein the Lord says:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." If one simply
engages in Krsna consciousness to understand Krsna, he surely becomes immune to the process of
repeated birth and death. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: such a
person, simply by engaging in Krsna consciousness or understanding the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna, becomes quite fit to return home, back to Godhead. Even those who are obsessed with
material desires may also come to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so steadily that they go
back to Godhead. The fact is that if one comes to Krsna consciousness, although he may have many
material desires, he becomes increasingly attracted to the lotus feet of Krsna through associating with the
Supreme Lord by chanting His holy name. The Supreme Lord and His holy name are identical. Thus he
becomes uninterested in attachment to material enjoyment. The perfection of life is to be uninterested in
material enjoyment and interested in Krsna. If one comes to Krsna consciousness somehow or other, even
for material gain, the result is that he will be liberated. Kamad dvesad bhayat snehat. Whether for the
satisfaction of material desires, because of the influence of envy, because of fear, because of affection or
because of any other reason, if one comes to Krsna, his life is successful.
