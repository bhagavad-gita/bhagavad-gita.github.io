<h2>Text</h2>
yatha hi bhagavan eva
vastutah sad asac ca yat
satyenanena nah sarve
yantu nasam upadravah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--just as; hi--indeed; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; eva--undoubtedly; vastutah--
at the ultimate issue; sat--manifested; asat--unmanifested; ca--and; yat--whatever; satyena--by the truth;
anena--this; nah--our; sarve--all; yantu--let them go; nasam--to annihilation; upadravah--disturbances.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The subtle and gross cosmic manifestation is material, but nevertheless it is nondifferent from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is ultimately the cause of all causes. Cause and effect are
factually one because the cause is present in the effect. Therefore the Absolute Truth, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, can destroy all our dangers by any of His potent parts.

<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the material energy, the spiritual energy and
the entire creation are all individual substances. In the ultimate analysis, however, together they
constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead. Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual
knowledge see unity in diversity. For such advanced persons, the Lord's bodily decorations, His name, His
fame, His attributes and forms and the weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His
potency. According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the omniscient Lord, who manifests various
forms, is present everywhere. May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4) where Lord Krsna says, maya tatam idam
sarvam, indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy. This is confirmed in the Visnu
Purana (1.22.52):
ekadesa-sthitasyagner
jyotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah saktis
tathedam akhilam jagat
As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent
Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself
everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies. Since both cause and effect
are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect. Consequently the ornaments and
weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him. There is no
difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies. This is also confirmed in the Padma
Purana:
nama cintamanih krsnas
caitanya-rasa-vigrahah
purnah suddho nitya-mukto
'bhinnatvan nama-naminoh
The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially. The word purna means
"complete." The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities,
paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material
contamination. The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as
the Lord. Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him. Therefore
even worship of the Lord's weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord.
Mayavadis refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is maya, or false,
but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable. Although the Lord's original form and His
impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally. Therefore this
prayer says, patu sarvaih svarupair nah sada sarvatra sama-gah: "May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His
various forms, protect us everywhere." The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form,
qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees. Srila
Madhvacarya explains this as follows:
eka eva paro visnur
bhusaheti dhvajesv ajah
tat-tac-chakti-pradatvena
svayam eva vyavasthitah
satyenanena mam devah
patu sarvesvaro harih
