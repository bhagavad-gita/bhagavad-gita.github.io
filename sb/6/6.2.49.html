yathajnas tamasa yukta
upaste vyaktam eva hi
na veda purvam aparam
nasta-janma-smrtis tatha
SYNONYMS
yatha--just as; ajnah--an ignorant living being; tamasa--in sleep; yuktah--engaged; upaste--acts according
to; vyaktam--a body manifested in a dream; eva--certainly; hi--indeed; na veda--does not know; purvam--
the past body; aparam--the next body; nasta--lost; janma-smrtih--the remembrance of birth; tatha--
similarly.
TRANSLATION
As a sleeping person acts according to the body manifested in his dreams and accepts it to be himself, so
one identifies with his present body, which he acquired because of his past religious or irreligious actions,
and is unable to know his past or future lives.
PURPORT
A man engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he did in his past life to get his
present materially conditioned body, which is subjected to the threefold miseries. As stated by
Rsabhadeva in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.4), nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: a human being who is mad
after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully. Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: he performs sinful
actions simply for sense gratification. Na sadhu manye: this is not good. Yata atmano 'yam asann api
klesada asa dehah: because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which to suffer as he is
suffering in his present body because of his past sinful activities.
It should be understood that a person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance of
what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present and how he will suffer in the future. He is
completely in darkness. Therefore the Vedic injunction is, tamasi ma: "Don't remain in darkness." Jyotir
gama: "Try to go to the light." The light or illumination is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand
when he is elevated to the mode of goodness or when he transcends the mode of goodness by engaging in
devotional service to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord. This is described in the Svetasvatara
Upanisad (6.23):
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports
of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." The Vedas enjoin, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum
evabhigacchet: one must approach a spiritual master who has full knowledge of the Vedas and be
faithfully directed by him in order to become a devotee of the Lord. Then the knowledge of the Vedas will
be revealed. When the Vedic knowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of
material nature.
According to his association with the material modes of nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--a
living entity gets a particular type of body. The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness
is a qualified brahmana. Such a brahmana knows past, present and future because he consults the Vedic
literature and sees through the eyes of sastra (sastra-caksuh). He can understand what his past life was,
why be is in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches of maya and not accept
another material body. This is all possible when one is situated in the mode of goodness. Generally,
however, the living entities are engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance.
In any case, one receives an inferior or superior body at the discretion of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Paramatma. As stated in the previous verse:
manasaiva pure devah
purva-rupam vipasyati
anumimamsate 'purvam
manasa bhagavan ajah
Everything depends on bhagavan, or ajah, the unborn. Why doesn't one please Bhagavan to receive a
better body? The answer is ajnas tamasa: because of gross ignorance. One who is in complete darkness
cannot know what his past life was or what his next life will be; he is simply interested in his present
body. Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his
present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of
life and happiness is to eat as much as possible. A human being must be educated to understand his past
life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future. There is even a book, called Bhrgu-samhita,
which reveals information about one's past, present and future lives according to astrological calculations.
Somehow or other one must be enlightened about his past, present and future. One who is interested only
in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in
the mode of ignorance. His future is very, very dark. Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is
grossly covered by ignorance. Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance,
and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or
future.
