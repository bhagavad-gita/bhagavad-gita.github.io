<h2>Text</h2>
mriyamano harer nama
grnan putropacaritam
ajamilo 'py agad dhama
kim uta sraddhaya grnan
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mriyamanah--at the time of death; hareh nama--the holy name of Hari; grnan--chanting; putraupacaritam--
indicating his son; ajamilah--Ajamila; api--even; agat--went; dhama--to the spiritual world;
kim uta--what to speak of; sraddhaya--with faith and love; grnan--chanting.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While suffering at the time of death, Ajamila chanted the holy name of the Lord, and although the
chanting was directed toward his son, he nevertheless returned home, back to Godhead. Therefore if one
faithfully and inoffensively chants the holy name of the Lord, where is the doubt that he will return to
Godhead?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder. At that
time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able
to chant the Hare Krsna mantra very distinctly. Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of
chanting the holy name. While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the
Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be
properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith. In conclusion, one who chants the
holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.
Supplementary note to this chapter.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura's commentary to texts nine and ten of this chapter form a dialogue
concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the
Lord.
Someone may say, "It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed
from all the reactions of sinful life. However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only
once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning
for them for twelve years or more. How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of
the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins?"
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura replies by quoting verses nine and ten of this chapter: "The
chanting of the holy name of Lord Visnu is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other
valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a brahmana, or for
one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior. It is also the best method of
atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all
other sinful men. Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu, such sinful persons may attract the
attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers "Because this man has chanted My holy name, My
duty is to give him protection.' "
One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this
is not called atonement. Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not
completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts. Therefore atonement is not
as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. In the sastras it is said that if a person only once
chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately
considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection. This is confirmed by Sridhara
Svami. Thus when Ajamila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamaraja, the
Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Ajamila was freed from all
sinful reactions, the Visnudutas spoke on his behalf.
Ajamila had named his son Narayana, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again
and again. Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name Narayana
is not different from the Supreme Lord Narayana. When Ajamila named his son Narayana, all the
reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy
name of Narayana thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in Krsna consciousness.
One may argue, "Since he was constantly chanting the name of Narayana, how was it possible for him to
be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine?" By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering
upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of Narayana was the
cause of his being freed. However, his chanting would then have been a nama-aparadha. Namno balad
yasya hi papa-buddhih: one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the
holy name of the Lord is a nama-aparadhi, an offender to the holy name. In response it may be said that
Ajamila's chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of Narayana with the purpose of
counteracting his sins. He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his
chanting of the name of Narayana was neutralizing them. Thus he did not commit a nama-aparadha, and
his repeated chanting of the holy name of Narayana while calling his son may be called pure chanting.
Because of this pure chanting, Ajamila unconsciously accumulated the results of bhakti. Indeed, even his
first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life. To cite a logical
example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available. Similarly,
Ajamila's devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the
reactions did not affect him. In the sastras it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even
once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him. To give another example, if one
extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent's future victims from poisonous effects, even
if the serpent bites repeatedly. Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this
protects him eternally. He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas."
Chapter Three
Yamaraja Instructs His Messengers
As related in this chapter, the Yamadutas approached Yamaraja, who very exhaustively explained
bhagavata-dharma, the religious principle of devotional service. Yamaraja thus satisfied the Yamadutas,
who had been very disappointed. Yamaraja said, "Although Ajamila was calling for his son, he chanted the
holy name of the Lord, Narayana, and simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name, he
immediately achieved the association of Lord Visnu's order carriers, who saved him from your attempt to
arrest him. This is quite all right. It is a fact that even a chronically sinful person who chants the holy
name of the Lord, although not completely without offenses, does not take another material birth."
By chanting the holy name of the Lord, Ajamila had met four order carriers of Lord Visnu. They were
very beautiful and had quickly come to rescue him. Yamaraja now described them. "The Visnudutas are
all pure devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Person in regard to the creation, maintenance and annihilation
of this cosmic manifestation. Neither King Indra, Varuna, Siva, Brahma, the seven rsis nor I myself can
understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, who is self-sufficient and beyond the reach
of the material senses. With material senses, no one can attain enlightenment about Him. The Lord, the
master of the illusory energy, possesses transcendental qualities for the good fortune of everyone, and His
devotees are also qualified in that way. The devotees, concerned only with rescuing the fallen souls from
this material world, apparently take birth in different places in the material world just to save the
conditioned souls. If one is somewhat interested in spiritual life, the devotees of the Lord protect him in
many ways."
Yamaraja continued, "The essence of sanatana-dharma, or eternal religion, is extremely confidential. No
one but the Lord Himself can deliver that confidential religious system to human society. It is by the
mercy of the Lord that the transcendental system of religion can be understood by His pure devotees, and
specifically by the twelve mahajanas--Lord Brahma, Narada Muni, Lord Siva, the Kumaras, Kapila, Manu,
Prahlada, Janaka, Bhisma, Bali, Sukadeva Gosvami and me. Other learned scholars, headed by Jaimini, are
almost always covered by the illusory energy, and therefore they are more or less attracted by the flowery
language of the three Vedas, namely Rg, Yajur and Sama, which are called trayi. Instead of becoming pure
devotees, people captivated by the flowery words of these three Vedas are interested in the Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies. They cannot understand the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord.
Intelligent persons, however, take to the devotional service of the Lord. When they chant the holy name
of the Lord without offenses, they are no longer subject to my rulings. If by chance they commit some
sinful act, they are protected by the holy name of the Lord because that is where their interest lies. The
four weapons of the Lord, especially the club and the Sudarsana cakra, always protect the devotees. One
who chants, hears or remembers the holy name of the Lord without duplicity, or who prays or offers
obeisances to the Lord, becomes perfect, whereas even a learned person may be called to hell if he is
bereft of devotional service."
After Yamaraja thus described the glories of the Lord and His devotees, Sukadeva Gosvami further
explained the potency of chanting the holy name and the futility of performing Vedic ritualistic
ceremonies and pious activities for atonement.
