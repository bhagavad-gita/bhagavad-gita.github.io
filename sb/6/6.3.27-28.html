<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as great learned brahmanas who are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices can
extract the fire dormant within wooden fuel by chanting the fifteen Samidheni mantras, thus proving the
efficacy of the Vedic mantras, so those who are actually advanced in consciousness--in other words, those
who are Krsna conscious--can find the Supersoul, who by His own spiritual potency is situated within the
heart. The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements [material
nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification], and also by
the five material elements and the ten senses. These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy
of the Lord. Great yogis meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Paramatma, within the
core of the heart. May that Supersoul be pleased with me. The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for
liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life. One actually attains such liberation when he
engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of
service. The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material
senses. When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In his commentary to this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura uses the word durvijneyam, which
means "very difficult to realize." The pure stage of existence is described in Bhagavad-gita (7.28), wherein
Krsna says:
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination."
Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (9.14) the Lord says:
satatam kirtayanto mam
yatantas ca drdha-vratah
namasyantas ca mam bhaktya
nitya-yukta upasate
"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these
great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion."
One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead after transcending all material impediments.
Therefore Lord Krsna also says in the Gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."
To understand Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must undergo severe penances and
austerities, but since the path of devotional service is perfect, by following this process one can very easily
come to the spiritual platform and understand the Lord. This, too, is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.55),
wherein Krsna says:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And
when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom
of God."
Thus although the subject matter is durvijneyam, extremely difficult to understand, it becomes easy if
one follows the prescribed method. Coming in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible
through pure devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh. In this regard, Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.8.5): pravistah karnarandhrena
svanam bhava-saroruham. The process of hearing and chanting enters the core of the heart,
and in this way one becomes a pure devotee. By continuing this process, one comes to the stage of
transcendental love, and then he appreciates the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, a pure devotee, by devotional service, is able to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead despite many material impediments, which are all various energies of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Easily making his way through these impediments, a devotee comes
directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After all, the material impediments
described in these verses are but various energies of the Lord. When a devotee is eager to see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he prays to the Lord:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"O son of Maharaja Nanda [Krsna], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into
the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms
at Your lotus feet." Being pleased with the devotee, the Lord turns all his material impediments into
spiritual service. In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from the Visnu
Purana:
hladini sandhini samvit
tvayy eka sarva-samsthitau
hlada-tapa-kari misra
tvayi no guna-varjite
In the material world, the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as tapakari,
which means "causing miseries." Everyone hankers for happiness, but although happiness originally
comes from the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the material world, because
of material activities, the pleasure potency of the Lord becomes a source of miseries (hlada-tapa-kari).
False happiness in the material world is the source of distress, but when one's endeavors for happiness are
redirected toward the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this tapa-kari element of misery
is vanquished. An example given in this connection is that extracting fire from wood is certainly difficult,
but when the fire comes out it burns the wood to ashes. In other words, experiencing the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult for those devoid of devotional service, but everything
becomes easier for a devotee, and thus he can very easily meet the Supreme Lord.
Here the prayers say that the form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of material form and is
therefore inconceivable. A devotee prays, however, "My dear Lord, be pleased with me so that I may very
easily see Your transcendental form and potency." Nondevotees try to understand the Supreme Brahman
by discussions of neti neti. Nisedha-nirvana-sukhanubhutih: a devotee, however, simply by chanting the
holy name of the Lord, avoids such laborious speculations and realizes the existence of the Lord very
easily.
