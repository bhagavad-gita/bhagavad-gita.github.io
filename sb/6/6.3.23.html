tam vivaksum abhipretya
mahapurusa-kinkarah
sahasa pasyatas tasya
tatrantardadhire 'nagha
SYNONYMS
tam--him (Ajamila); vivaksum--desiring to speak; abhipretya--understanding; mahapurusa-kinkarah--
the order carriers of Lord Visnu; sahasa--suddenly; pasyatah tasya--while he looked on; tatra--there;
antardadhire--disappeared; anagha--O sinless Maharaja Pariksit.
TRANSLATION
O sinless Maharaja Pariksit, the order carriers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Visnudutas,
saw that Ajamila was attempting to say something, and thus they suddenly disappeared from his presence.
PURPORT
The sastras say:
papistha ye duracara
deva-brahmana-nindakah
apathya-bhojanas tesam
akale maranam dhruvam
"For persons who are papistha, very sinful, and duracara, misbehaved or very unclean in their habits,
who are against the existence of God, who disrespect Vaisnavas and brahmanas, and who eat anything
and everything, untimely death is sure." It is said that in Kali-yuga one has a maximum lifetime of one
hundred years, but as people become degraded, the duration of their lives decreases (prayenalpayusah).
Because Ajamila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to
have died immediately. When the Visnudutas saw Ajamila trying to say something to them, they
disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord. Since all his sinful reactions had been
vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord. Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is
completely free from all sinful activities. This is confirmed by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." The Visnudutas made Ajamila aware of devotional service so that He might immediately
become fit to return home, back to Godhead. To increase his eagerness to glorify the Lord, they
disappeared so that he would feel separation in their absence. In the mode of separation, glorification of
the Lord is very intense.
TEXTS 24-25
ajamilo 'py athakarnya
dutanam yama-krsnayoh
dharmam bhagavatam suddham
trai-vedyam ca gunasrayam
bhaktiman bhagavaty asu
mahatmya-sravanad dhareh
anutapo mahan asit
smarato 'subham atmanah
SYNONYMS
ajamilah--Ajamila; api--also; atha--thereafter; akarnya--hearing; dutanam--of the order carriers; yamakrsnayoh--
of Yamaraja and Lord Krsna; dharmam--actual religious principles; bhagavatam--as described
in Srimad-Bhagavatam, or concerning the relationship between the living being and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; suddham--pure; trai-vedyam--mentioned in three Vedas; ca--also; guna-asrayam--
material religion, under the modes of material nature; bhakti-man--a pure devotee (cleansed of the modes
of material nature); bhagavati--unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; asu--immediately; mahatmya--
glorification of the name, fame, etc.; sravanat--because of hearing; hareh--of Lord Hari; anutapah--regret;
mahan--very great; asit--there was; smaratah--remembering; asubham--all the inglorious activities;
atmanah--done by himself.
TRANSLATION
After hearing the discourses between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, Ajamila could understand the
religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature. These principles are mentioned in
the three Vedas. He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the
modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Furthermore, Ajamila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities and
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He thus became a perfectly pure devotee. He could then
remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (2.45) Lord Krsna told Arjuna:
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the Self." The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising
to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his
being elevated to spiritual life. Krsna therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the
process of transcendental religion. The transcendental position of devotional service is also confirmed in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6). Sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje. Bhakti, devotional
service, is paro dharmah, transcendental dharma; it is not material dharma. People generally think that
religion should be pursued for material profit. This may be suitable for persons interested in material life,
but one who is interested in spiritual life should be attached to paro dharmah, the religious principles by
which one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord (yato bhaktir adhoksaje). The bhagavata religion
teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to
surrender to the Lord. When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from
impediments and completely satisfied (ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati). Having been elevated to
that platform, Ajamila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form
and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
