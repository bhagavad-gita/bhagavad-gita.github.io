<h2>Text</h2>
bhuh ksetram jiva-samjnam yad
anadi nija-bandhanam
adrstva tasya nirvanam
kim asat-karmabhir bhavet
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhuh--the earth; ksetram--the field of activities; jiva-samjnam--the designation of the spiritual living
being who is bound by different results of activity; yat--which; anadi--existing since time immemorial;
nija-bandhanam--causing his own bondage; adrstva--without seeing; tasya--of this; nirvanam--the
cessation; kim--what benefit; asat-karmabhih--with temporary fruitive activities; bhavet--there can be.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[The Haryasvas understood the meaning of Narada's words as follows.] The word "bhuh" ["the earth"]
refers to the field of activities. The material body, which is a result of the living being's actions, is his field
of activities, and it gives him false designations. Since time immemorial, he has received various types of
material bodies, which are the roots of bondage to the material world. If one foolishly engages in
temporary fruitive activities and does not look toward the cessation of this bondage, what will be the
benefit of his actions?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narada Muni spoke to the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, about ten allegorical subjects--the
king, the kingdom, the river, the house, the physical elements and so forth. After considering these by
themselves, the Haryasvas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness,
but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement. This is a very important verse, since all
the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies. A
man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense
gratification all day and night. Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various
activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body. Especially in the human form of body,
one's duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the
instructions of Narada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily
activities to enjoy maya-sukha--flickering, temporary happiness. They do not know how to become free
from their material encagement. Rsabhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it
encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition.
The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, could immediately understand the purport of Narada's
instructions. Our Krsna consciousness movement is especially meant for such enlightenment. We are
trying to enlighten humanity so that people may come to the understanding that they should work hard
in tapasya for self-realization and freedom from the continuous bondage of birth, death, old age and
disease in one body after another. Maya, however, is very strong; she is expert in putting impediments in
the way of this understanding. Therefore sometimes one comes to the Krsna consciousness movement but
again falls into the clutches of maya, not understanding the importance of this movement.
