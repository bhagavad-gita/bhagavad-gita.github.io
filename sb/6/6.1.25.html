<h2>Text</h2>
sa baddha-hrdayas tasminn
arbhake kala-bhasini
niriksamanas tal-lilam
mumude jaratho bhrsam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; baddha-hrdayah--being very attached; tasmin--to that; arbhake--small child; kala-bhasini--who
could not talk clearly but talked in broken language; niriksamanah--seeing; tat--his; lilam--pastimes (such
as walking and talking to his father); mumude--enjoyed; jarathah--the old man; bhrsam--very much.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of the child's broken language and awkward movements, old Ajamila was very much attached
to him. He always took care of the child and enjoyed the child's activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here it is clearly mentioned that the child Narayana was so young that he could not even speak or walk
properly. Since the old man was very attached to the child, he enjoyed the child's activities, and because
the child's name was Narayana, the old man always chanted the holy name of Narayana. Although he was
referring to the small child and not to the original Narayana, the name of Narayana is so powerful that
even by chanting his son's name he was becoming purified (harer nama harer nama harer namaiva
kevalam). Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore declared that if one's mind is somehow or other attracted by
the holy name of Krsna (tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet), one is on the path of liberation.
It is customary in Hindu society for parents to give their children names like Krsnadasa, Govinda dasa,
Narayana dasa and Vrndavana dasa. Thus they chant the names Krsna, Govinda, Narayana and Vrndavana
and get the chance to be purified.
