yad yad acarati sreyan
itaras tat tad ihate
sa yat pramanam kurute
lokas tad anuvartate
SYNONYMS
yat yat--whatever; acarati--executes; sreyan--a first-class man with full knowledge of religious principles;
itarah--the subordinate man; tat tat--that; ihate--performs; sah--he (the great man); yat--whatever;
pramanam--as evidence or as the right thing; kurute--accepts; lokah--the general public; tat--that;
anuvartate--follows.
TRANSLATION
The mass of people follow the example of a leader in society and imitate his behavior. They accept as
evidence whatever the leader accepts.
PURPORT
Although Ajamila was not punishable, the Yamadutas were insisting on taking him away to Yamaraja for
punishment. This was adharma, contrary to religious principles. The Visnudutas feared that if such
irreligious acts were allowed, the management of human society would be spoiled. In modern times, the
Krsna consciousness movement is trying to introduce the right principles of management for human
society, but unfortunately the governments of Kali-yuga do not properly support the Hare Krsna
movement because they do not appreciate its valuable service. The Hare Krsna movement is the right
movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public
leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity's sinful
condition.

entities; sa-ghrnah--who has a soft heart for the good of all people; dogdhum--to give pain; arhati--is able.
TRANSLATION
People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and
irreligion. The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head
on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master's protection. If a leader is actually kindhearted
and deserves to be the object of a living entity's faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has
fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?
PURPORT
The Sanskrit word visvasta-ghata refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust. The mass of
people should always feel security because of the government's protection. Therefore, how regrettable it is
for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons.
We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together
peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the
Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In this age, animals are
kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon
as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter. Such cruelty is condemned by Vaisnavas
like the Visnudutas. Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for
such suffering. One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith,
whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful. Because such betrayals now
go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated. The people of this age
are therefore described as mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah. As a consequence of
such sinfulness, men are condemned (mandah), their intelligence is unclear (sumanda-matayah), they are
unfortunate (manda-bhagyah), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (upadrutah).
This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions.
