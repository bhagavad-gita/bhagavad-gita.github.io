utsrjya--giving up; bandha--of bondage; moksa--and of liberation; anudarsanam--informing about the
ways; vivikta-padam--distinguishing spirit from matter; ajnaya--not knowing; kim asat-karmabhih
bhavet--what can be the use of temporary fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
[Narada Muni had spoken of a swan. That swan is explained in this verse.] The Vedic literatures
[sastras] vividly describe how to understand the Supreme Lord, the source of all material and spiritual
energy. Indeed, they elaborately explain these two energies. The swan [hamsa] is one who discriminates
between matter and spirit, who accepts the essence of everything, and who explains the means of bondage
and the means of liberation. The words of scriptures consist of variegated vibrations. If a foolish rascal
leaves aside the study of these sastras to engage in temporary activities, what will be the result?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Krsna consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages,
especially Western languages such as English, French and German. The leaders of the Western world, the
Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are
very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization. A sane man,
however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have
nothing to do with eternal life. The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and
therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people
knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages.
The word vivikta-padam refers to the path of logical discourses concerning the aim of life. If one does
not discuss that which is important in life, one is put into darkness and must struggle for existence. What,
then, is the benefit of his advancement in knowledge? The people of the West are seeing their students
becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education. The Krsna consciousness
movement, however, is trying to convert misguided, drug-addicted students to the service of Krsna and
engage them in the best welfare activities for human society.
