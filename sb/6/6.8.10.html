<h2>Text</h2>
aho dainyam aho kastam
parakyaih ksana-bhanguraih
yan nopakuryad asvarthair
martyah sva-jnati-vigrahaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--alas; dainyam--a miserable condition; aho--alas; kastam--simply tribulation; parakyaih--which after
death are eatable by dogs and jackals; ksana-bhanguraih--perishable at any moment; yat--because; na--not;
upakuryat--would help; a-sva-arthaih--not meant for self-interest; martyah--a living entity destined to die;
sva--with his wealth; jnati--relatives and friends; vigrahaih--and his body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This body, which is eatable by jackals and dogs after death, does not actually do any good for me, the
spirit soul. It is usable only for a short time and may perish at any moment. The body and its possessions,
its riches and relatives, must all be engaged for the benefit of others, or else they will be sources of
tribulation and misery.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Similar advice is also given in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.22.35):
etavaj janma-saphalyam
dehinam iha dehisu
pranair arthair dhiya vaca
sreya-acaranam sada
"It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life,
wealth, intelligence and words." This is the mission of life. One's own body and the bodies of his friends
and relatives, as well as one's own riches and everything else one has, should be engaged for the benefit of
others. This is the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 9.41):
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
"One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India [Bharata-varsa] should make his life
successful and work for the benefit of all other people.
The word upakuryat means para-upakara, helping others. Of course, in human society there are many
institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity
for philanthropy is ineffectual. They do not know the ultimate goal of life (sreya acaranam), which is to
please the Supreme Lord. If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving
the ultimate goal of life--to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead--they would all be perfect.
Humanitarian work without Krsna is nothing. Krsna must be brought to the center of all our activities;
otherwise no activity will have value.
