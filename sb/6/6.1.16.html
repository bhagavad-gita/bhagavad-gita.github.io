<h2>Text</h2>
na tatha hy aghavan rajan
puyeta tapa-adibhih
yatha krsnarpita-pranas
tat-purusa-nisevaya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; tatha--so much; hi--certainly; agha-van--a man full of sinful activities; rajan--O King; puyeta--
can become purified; tapah-adibhih--by executing the principles of austerity, penance, brahmacarya and
other purifying processes; yatha--as much as; krsna-arpita-pranah--the devotee whose life is fully Krsna
conscious; tat-purusa-nisevaya--by engaging his life in the service of Krsna's representative.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, if a sinful person engages in the service of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and thus learns
how to dedicate his life unto the lotus feet of Krsna, he can be completely purified. One cannot be purified
merely by undergoing austerity, penance, brahmacarya and the other methods of atonement I have
previously described.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Tat-purusa refers to a preacher of Krsna consciousness, such as the spiritual master. Srila Narottama
dasa Thakura has said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: "Without serving a bona fide spiritual
master, an ideal Vaisnava, who can be delivered from the clutches of maya?" This idea is also expressed in
many other places. Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) says, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh: if one desires
liberation from the clutches of maya, one must associate with a pure devotee mahatma. A mahatma is one
who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(9.13):
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible." Thus the symptom of a mahatma is that he has no engagement
other than service to Krsna. One must render service to a Vaisnava in order to get freed from sinful
reactions, revive one's original Krsna consciousness and be trained in how to love Krsna. This is the result
of mahatma-seva. Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one's sinful
life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock
of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for Krsna. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight,
one's sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no
separate endeavor is required.
The word krsna-rpita-pranah refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving Krsna, not to being
saved from the path to hellish life. A devotee is narayana-parayana, or vasudeva-parayana, which means
that the path of Vasudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana
bibhyati (Bhag. 6.17.28): such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere. There is a path toward liberation
in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a narayana-para devotee is
unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember Krsna, wherever he may be. Such a devotee is
unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to Krsna. When a devotee is
put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as Krsna's mercy: tat te 'nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag.
10.14.8). He does not protest, "Oh, I am such a great devotee of Krsna. Why have I been put into this
misery?" Instead he thinks, "This is Krsna's mercy." Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who
engages in the service of Krsna's representative. This is the secret of success.
