yo bhuta-soka-harsabhyam
atma socati hrsyati

TRANSLATION
If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious
principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.
PURPORT
One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties
according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature. In this verse, however, real religious
principles are explained. Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others
happy. Atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own. It is on
this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence--ahimsah parama-dharmah--is established.
We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living
beings. Lord Buddha's mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the
greatest religious principle is nonviolence.
One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man. That is the greatest
hypocrisy. Jesus Christ said, "Do not kill," but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of
slaughterhouses while posing as Christians. Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse. One should be
happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy. This is the principle to be
followed. Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the
happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals. That is not recommended herein. This
verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities. Regardless of whether human.
animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Krsna says
in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this
material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father." The different forms of these living entities are only
their external dresses. Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God. Therefore one
should not favor only one kind of living being. A Vaisnava sees all living entities as part and parcel of
God. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (5.18 and 18.54):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]."
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state
he attains pure devotional service unto Me." A Vaisnava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he
laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy. A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; he
is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism. Therefore a Vaisnava
is always busy preaching Krsna consciousness throughout the world.
