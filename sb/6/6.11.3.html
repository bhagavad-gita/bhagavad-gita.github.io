<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O great sage, what was the reason for Indra's
unhappiness? I wish to hear about this. When he killed Vrtrasura, all the demigods were extremely happy.
Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This, of course, is a very intelligent question. When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are
happy. In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vrtrasura's having been
killed, Indra was unhappy. Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he
had killed a great devotee and brahmana. Vrtrasura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he
was a great devotee and therefore a great brahmana.
Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahlada Maharaja and
Bali Maharaja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons. Therefore in terms of real
culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth. In his dealings while
fighting with Indra, Vrtrasura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vrtrasura was
transferred to Vaikunthaloka to become an associate of Sankarsana. Indra knew this, and therefore he was
morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaisnava or brahmana.
A Vaisnava is already a brahmana, although a brahmana may not be a Vaisnava. The Padma Purana says:
sat-karma-nipuno vipro
mantra-tantra-visaradah
avaisnavo gurur na syad
vaisnavah sva-paco guruh
One may be a brahmana in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge
(mantra-tantra-visaradah), but if he is not a Vaisnava, he cannot be a guru. This means that an expert
brahmana may not be a Vaisnava, but a Vaisnava is already a brahmana. A millionaire may very easily
possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not
necessarily a millionaire. Vrtrasura was a perfect Vaisnava, and therefore he was also a brahmana.
