<h2>Text</h2>
suresa kasman na hinosi vajram

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sura-isa--O King of the demigods; kasmat--why; na--not; hinosi--you hurl; vajram--the thunderbolt;
purah sthite--standing in front; vairini--your enemy; mayi--at me; amogham--which is infallible (your
thunderbolt); ma--do not; samsayisthah--doubt; na--not; gada iva--like the club; vajrah--the thunderbolt;
syat--may be; nisphalah--with no result; krpana--from a miserly person; artha--for money; iva--like;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King of the demigods, since I, your enemy, am standing before you, why don't you hurl your
thunderbolt at me? Although your attack upon me with your club was certainly useless, like a request of
money from a miser, the thunderbolt you carry will not be useless. You need have no doubts about this.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When King Indra threw his club at Vrtrasura, Vrtrasura caught it in his left hand and retaliated by using
it to strike the head of Indra's elephant. Thus Indra's attack was a disastrous failure. Indeed, Indra's
elephant was injured and thrown back fourteen yards. Therefore even though Indra stood with the
thunderbolt to hurl against Vrtrasura, he was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail.
Vrtrasura, however, being a Vaisnava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not fail, for Vrtrasura
knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Lord Visnu. Although Indra had
doubts because he could not understand that Lord Visnu's order never fails, Vrtrasura understood Lord
Visnu's purpose. Vrtrasura was eager to be killed by the thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord
Visnu's instructions because he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead. He was
simply waiting for the opportunity of the thunderbolt's being released. In effect, therefore, Vrtrasura told
Indra, "If you want to kill me, since I am your enemy, take this opportunity. Kill me. You will gain
victory, and I shall go back to Godhead. Your deed will be equally beneficial for both of us. Do it
immediately."
