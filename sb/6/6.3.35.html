When the great sage Agastya, the son of Kumbha, was residing in the Malaya Hills and worshiping the

Chapter Four
The Hamsa-guhya Prayers
After Maharaja Pariksit appealed to Sukadeva Gosvami to describe in further detail the creation of the
living entities within this universe, Sukadeva Gosvami informed him that when the Pracetas, the ten sons
of Pracinabarhi, entered the sea to execute austerities, the planet earth was neglected because of the
absence of a king. Naturally many weeds and unnecessary trees grew, and no food grains were produced.
Indeed, all the land became like a forest. When the ten Pracetas came out of the sea and saw the entire
world full of trees, they were very angry with the trees and decided to destroy them all to rectify the
situation. Thus the Pracetas created wind and fire to burn the trees to ashes. Soma, however, the king of
the moon and the king of all vegetation, forbade the Pracetas to destroy the trees, since the trees are the
source of fruit and flowers for all living beings. Just to satisfy the Pracetas, Soma gave them a beautiful girl
born of Pramloca Apsara. By the semen of all the Pracetas, Daksa was born of that girl.
In the beginning, Daksa created all the demigods, demons and human beings, but when he found the
population not increasing properly, he took sannyasa and went to Vindhya Mountain. where be
underwent severe austerities and offered Lord Visnu a particular prayer known as Hamsa-guhya, by which
Lord Visnu became very pleased with him. The contents of the prayer were as follows.
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, Lord Hari, is the controller of both the living
entities and the material nature. He is self-sufficient and self-effulgent. As the subject matter of perception
is not the cause of our perceiving senses, so the living entity, although within his body, does not cause his
eternal friend the Supersoul, who is the cause of creation of all the senses. Because of the living entity's
ignorance, his senses are engaged with material objects. Since the living entity is alive, he can understand
the creation of this material world to some extent, but he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is beyond the conception of the body, mind and intelligence. Nevertheless, great sages who
are always in meditation can see the personal form of the Lord within their hearts.
"Since an ordinary living being is materially contaminated, his words and intelligence are also material.
Therefore he cannot ascertain the Supreme Personality of Godhead by manipulating his material senses.
The conception of God derived through the material senses is inaccurate because the Supreme Lord is
beyond the material senses, but when one engages his senses in devotional service, the eternal Supreme
Personality of Godhead is revealed on the platform of the soul. When that Supreme Godhead becomes the
aim of one's life, one is said to have attained spiritual knowledge.
"The Supreme Brahman is the cause of all causes because He originally existed before the creation. He is
the original cause of everything, both material and spiritual, and His existence is independent. However,
the Lord has a potency called avidya, the illusory energy, which induces the false arguer to think himself
perfect and which induces the illusory energy to bewilder the conditioned soul. That Supreme Brahman,
the Supersoul, is very affectionate to His devotees. To bestow mercy upon them, He discloses His form,
name, attributes and qualities to be worshiped within this material world.
"Unfortunately, however, those who are materially absorbed worship various demigods. As the air
passes over a lotus flower and carries the scent of the flower with it, or as the air sometimes carries dust
and therefore assumes colors, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as the various demigods
according to the desires of His various foolish worshipers, but actually He is the supreme truth, Lord
Visnu. To fulfill the desires of His devotees, He appears in various incarnations, and therefore there is no
need to worship the demigods."
Being very satisfied by the prayers of Daksa, Lord Visnu appeared before Daksa with eight arms. The
Lord was dressed in yellow garments and had a blackish complexion. Understanding that Daksa was very
eager to follow the path of enjoyment, the Lord awarded him the potency to enjoy the illusory energy.
The Lord offered him the daughter of Pancajana named Asikni, who was suitable for Maharaja Daksa to
enjoy in sex. Indeed, Daksa received his name because he was very expert in sex life. After awarding this
benediction, Lord Visnu disappeared.
