<h2>Text</h2>
vikarsato 'ntar hrdayad
dasi-patim ajamilam
yama-presyan visnuduta
varayam asur ojasa
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vikarsatah--snatching; antah hrdayat--from within the heart; dasi-patim--the husband of the prostitute;
ajamilam--Ajamila; yama-presyan--the messengers of Yamaraja; visnu-dutah--the order carriers of Lord
Visnu; varayam asuh--forbade; ojasa--with resounding voices.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The order carriers of Yamaraja were snatching the soul from the core of the heart of Ajamila, the
husband of the prostitute, but with resounding voices the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas,
forbade them to do so.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A Vaisnava, one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu, is always protected by Lord
Visnu's order carriers. Because Ajamila had chanted the holy name of Narayana, the Visnudutas not only
immediately arrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamadutas not to touch him. By speaking
with resounding voices, the Visnudutas threatened to punish the Yamadutas if they continued trying to
snatch Ajamila's soul from his heart. The order carriers of Yamaraja have jurisdiction over all sinful living
entities, but the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, are capable of punishing anyone, including
Yamaraja, if he wrongs a Vaisnava.
Materialistic scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body with their material
instruments, but this verse clearly explains that the soul is within the core of the heart (hrdaya); it is from
the heart that the Yamadutas were extracting the soul of Ajamila. Similarly, we learn that the Supersoul,
Lord Visnu, is also situated within the heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). In the
Upanisads it is said that the Supersoul and the individual soul are living in the same tree of the body as
two friendly birds. The Supersoul is said to be friendly because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so
kind to the original soul that when the original soul transmigrates from one body to another, the Lord
goes with him. Furthermore, according to the desire and karma of the individual soul, the Lord, through
the agency of maya, creates another body for him.
The heart of the body is a mechanical arrangement. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." Yantra means a machine,
such as an automobile. The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its
director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One's body is
created through the agency of maya (karmana daiva-netrena), and according to one's activities in this life,
another vehicle is created, again under the supervision of daivi maya (daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya
duratyaya). At the appropriate time, one's next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul
and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine. This is the process of transmigration. During
transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamaraja and
put into a particular type of hellish life (naraka) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which
he will live in his next body.
