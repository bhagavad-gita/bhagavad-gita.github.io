incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; aprabodhat--from ignorance of the sastra; buddhah
tu--also Lord Buddha; pasanda-gana--of atheists creating disillusionment for innocent persons; pramadat--

<h2>Translation</h2>
May the Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Vyasadeva protect me from all kinds of ignorance
resulting from the absence of Vedic knowledge. May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed
to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge
and ritualistic action. May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an
incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for
various purposes. Srila Vyasadeva, Mahamuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human
society. If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may
consult the books left by Srila Vyasadeva, Upanisads, Vedanta-sutra (Brahma-sutra), Mahabharata,
Srimad-Bhagavatam Maha-purana (Vyasadeva's commentary on the Brahma-sutra) and the other
seventeen Puranas. Only by the mercy of Srila Vyasadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental
knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.
As described by Srila Jayadeva Gosvami in his Dasavatara-stotra, Lord Buddha apparently decried the
Vedic knowledge:
nindasi yajna-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam
sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-pasu-ghatam
kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare
The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to
save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed. When pasandis were cheating by killing animals on
the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic yajnas, the Lord said, "If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I
do not accept the Vedic principles." Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic
principles. One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the
injunctions of the Vedas.
The Kalki avatara is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this age of
Kali. Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga
advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real
religious principles enunciated by Lord Krsna before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of
surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not
surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna. Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion
are actually opposed to the Vedic principles. Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on the
plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation. Atheistic men generally say, yata mata
tata patha. According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human
society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle. This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious
principles mentioned in the Vedas, and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kaliyuga
progresses. In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Kesava, will descend to
kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.
