<h2>Text</h2>
muktanam api siddhanam
narayana-parayanah
sudurlabhah prasantatma
kotisv api maha-mune
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
muktanam--of those who are liberated during this life (who are unattached to the bodily comforts of
society, friendship and love); api--even; siddhanam--who are perfect (because they understand the
insignificance of bodily comforts); narayana-parayanah--a person who has concluded that Narayana is the
Supreme; su-durlabhah--very rarely found; prasanta--fully pacified; atma--whose mind; kotisu--out of
millions and trillions; api--even; maha-mune--O great sage.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may
be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krsna. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring mukti, or
liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the
materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the
vanaprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the
platform of sannyasa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life.
Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone
liberated. Indeed, although many men take sannyasa to become liberated, because of their imperfections
they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.
Jnanis, yogis and karmis devoid of devotional service are called offenders. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
says, mayavadi krsne aparadhi: one who thinks that everything is maya instead of thinking that everything
is Krsna is called an aparadhi, or offender. Although the Mayavadis, impersonalists, are offenders at the
lotus feet of Krsna, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self.
They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life
is. If such a person becomes narayana-parayana, a devotee of Lord Narayana, he is better than a jivanmukta,
one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence.
There are two kinds of jnanis. One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal
realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is
said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sthula-tusavaghatinah). The other class of jnanis,
whose jnana is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds--those who are devoted to the so-called false form
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the actual spiritual form. The Mayavadi devotees worship Narayana or Visnu with
the idea that Visnu has accepted a form of maya and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The
pure devotee, however, never thinks that Visnu has accepted a body of maya; instead, he knows perfectly
well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in
knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32):
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
"O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure.
Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are
sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet." Evidence of
this same point is also given in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), wherein the Lord says:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be." When rascals (mudhas) see that Krsna acts exactly like a human
being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the param bhavam, His
transcendental form and activities. Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gita (9.12) as follows:
moghasa mogha-karmano
mogha-jnana vicetasah
raksasim asurim caiva
prakrtim mohinim sritah
"Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded
condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all
defeated." Such persons do not know that Krsna's body is not material. There is no distinction between
Krsna's body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Krsna as a human being, they deride Him.
They cannot imagine how a person like Krsna could be the origin of everything (govindam adi-purusam
tam aham bhajami). Such persons are described as moghasah, baffled in their hopes. Whatever they desire
for the future will be baffled. Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as
moghasah because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.
Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated,
because this is not the result of devotional service. However, they are also given a chance to engage in
devotional service and be purified. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted."
Unless the dirt within the core of one's heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee.
Therefore the word sudurlabhah ("very rarely found") is used in this verse. Not only among hundreds and
thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found. Therefore
the words kotisv api are used herein. Srila Madhvacarya gives the following quotations from the Tantra
Bhagavata:
nava-kotyas tu devanam
rsayah sapta-kotayah
narayanayanah sarve
ye kecit tat-parayanah
"There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called narayanayana, devotees
of Lord Narayana. Among them, only a few are called narayana-parayana."
narayanayana deva
rsy-adyas tat-parayanah
brahmadyah kecanaiva syuh
siddho yogya-sukham labhan
The difference between the siddhas and narayana-parayanas is that direct devotees are called narayanaparayanas
whereas those who perform various types of mystic yoga are called siddhas.
