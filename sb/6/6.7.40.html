<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, O personified three worlds, father of the three worlds! O strength of the three worlds, in the
form of the Vamana incarnation! O three-eyed form of Nrsimhadeva! O most beautiful person within the
three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the
Danavas, is but an expansion of Your energy. O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in
Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful. You
appear as Lord Vamanadeva, Lord Rama and Lord Krsna. You appear sometimes as an animal like Lord
Boar, sometimes a mixed incarnation like Lord Nrsimhadeva and Lord Hayagriva, and sometimes an
aquatic like Lord Fish and Lord Tortoise. Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the
demons and Danavas. We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You
so desire, to kill the great demon Vrtrasura.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are two kinds of devotees, known as sakama and akama. Pure devotees are akama, whereas
devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called sakama because they still want
to enjoy material opulence. Because of their pious activities, the sakama devotees are promoted to the
higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources. The sakama
devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and Raksasas, but the Lord is so kind that He always
saves them by appearing as an incarnation. The Lord's incarnations are so powerful that Lord Vamanadeva
covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step. The Lord is
called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three
steps.
The difference between sakama and akama devotees is that when sakama devotees, like the demigods,
fall into difficulty, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas akama devotees,
even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits. Even if an akama devotee is
suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences. He
never disturbs the Lord. Sakama devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty,
but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the
Lord. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer their prayers and service more
enthusiastically. In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home,
back to Godhead, without a doubt. Sakama devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they
desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead. It is to be noted
herein that Lord Visnu, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees. Srila
Madhvacarya says: vividham bhava-patratvat sarve visnor vibhutayah. Krsna is the original Personality of
Godhead (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Visnu.
