<h2>Text</h2>
sri-visnuduta ucuh
yuyam vai dharma-rajasya
yadi nirdesa-karinah
bruta dharmasya nas tattvam
yac cadharmasya laksanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-visnudutah ucuh--the blessed messengers of Lord Visnu spoke; yuyam--all of you; vai--indeed;
dharma-rajasya--of King Yamaraja, who knows the religious principles; yadi--if; nirdesa-karinah--order
carriers; bruta--just speak; dharmasya--of religious principles; nah--unto us; tattvam--the truth; yat--that
which; ca--also; adharmasya--of impious activities; laksanam--symptoms.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The blessed messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, said: If you are actually servants of Yamaraja,
you must explain to us the meaning of religious principles and the symptoms of irreligion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This inquiry by the Visnudutas to the Yamadutas is most important. A servant must know the
instructions of his master. The servants of Yamaraja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore
the Visnudutas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious
principles. A Vaisnava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the
instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." Therefore
surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion. Those who have
surrendered to the principles of material nature instead of to Krsna are all impious, regardless of their
material position. Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to Krsna, and therefore
they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge. As Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." One who has not
surrendered to Krsna does not know the true principle of religion; otherwise he would have surrendered.
The question posed by the Visnudutas was very suitable. One who represents someone else must fully
know that person's mission. The devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement must therefore be fully
aware of the mission of Krsna and Lord Caitanya; otherwise they will be considered foolish. All devotees,
especially preachers, must know the philosophy of Krsna consciousness so as not to be embarrassed and
insulted when they preach.
