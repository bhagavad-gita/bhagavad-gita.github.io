<h2>Text</h2>
iti vyavasita rajan
haryasva eka-cetasah
prayayus tam parikramya
panthanam anivartanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; vyavasitah--being fully convinced by the instructions of Narada Muni; rajan--O King;
haryasvah--the sons of Prajapati Daksa; eka-cetasah--all being of the same opinion; prayayuh--left; tam--
Narada Muni; parikramya--circumambulating; panthanam--on the path; anivartanam--which does not
bring one back again to this material world.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after hearing the instructions of Narada, the Haryasvas,
the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were firmly convinced. They all believed in his instructions and reached the
same conclusion. Having accepted him as their spiritual master, they circumambulated that great sage and
followed the path by which one never returns to this world.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this verse we can understand the meaning of initiation and the duties of a disciple and spiritual
master. The spiritual master never instructs his disciple, "Take a mantra from me, pay me some money,
and by practicing this yoga system you will become very expert in materialistic life." This is not the duty
of a spiritual master. Rather, the spiritual master teaches the disciple how to give up materialistic life, and
the disciple's duty is to assimilate his instructions and ultimately follow the path back home, back to
Godhead, from whence no one returns to this material world.
After hearing the instructions of Narada Muni, the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, decided not
to be entangled in materialistic life by begetting hundreds of children and having to take care of them.
This would have been unnecessarily entangling. The Haryasvas did not consider pious and impious
activities. Their materialistic father had instructed them to increase the population, but because of the
words of Narada Muni, they could not heed that instruction. Narada Muni, as their spiritual master, gave
them the sastric instructions that they should give up this material world, and as bona fide disciples they
followed his instructions. One should not endeavor to wander to different planetary systems within this
universe, for even if one goes to the topmost planetary system, Brahmaloka, one must return again (ksine
punye martya-lokam visanti). The endeavors of karmis are a useless waste of time. One should endeavor
to return home, back to Godhead. This is the perfection of life. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein
repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth
again."
