<h2>Text</h2>
sri-visnuduta ucuh
aho kastam dharma-drsam
adharmah sprsate sabham
yatradandyesv apapesu
dando yair dhriyate vrtha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-visnudutah ucuh--the Visnudutas said; aho--alas; kastam--how painful it is; dharma-drsam--of
persons interested in maintaining religion; adharmah--irreligion; sprsate--is affecting; sabham--the
assembly; yatra--wherein; adandyesu--upon persons not to be punished; apapesu--who are sinless;
dandah--punishment; yaih--by whom; dhriyate--is being allotted; vrtha--unnecessarily.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Visnudutas said: Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where
religion should be maintained. Indeed, those in charge of maintaining the religious principles are
needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Visnudutas accused the Yamadutas of violating the religious principles by attempting to drag
Ajamila to Yamaraja for punishment. Yamaraja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious. However,
if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamaraja is contaminated. This principle
applies not only in the assembly of Yamaraja, but throughout human society also.
In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king's court or the
government. Unfortunately, in this yuga, Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the
government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not. It is said that in the Kali-yuga if
one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice. Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that
magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments. Sometimes religious men who preach the Krsna
consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and
courts. The Visnudutas, who are Vaisnavas, lamented for these very regrettable facts. Because of their
spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vaisnavas go out to preach according to the standard method
of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vaisnavas who have
dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts
on false charges of disturbing the peace.
