Gosvami; yatha--so that; eva--indeed; narakan--all the hellish conditions into which the impious are put;
narah--human beings; nana--varieties of; ugra--terrible; yatanan--conditions of suffering; na iyat--may not

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O greatly fortunate and opulent Sukadeva Gosvami, now kindly tell me how human beings may be
saved from having to enter hellish conditions in which they suffer terrible pains.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Canto, Sukadeva Gosvami has explained that people who
commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer. Now Maharaja Pariksit, being a devotee,
is concerned with how this can be stopped. A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; in other words, he has no
personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble. Prahlada Maharaja said, "My Lord, I
have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter
a trance of ecstasy. I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who
are busy with maya-sukha, temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You."
This is the problem faced by a Vaisnava. Because a Vaisnava fully takes shelter of the Supreme personality
of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen,
conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the
next. Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from Sukadeva Gosvami how humanity can
be saved from gliding down to hell. Sukadeva Gosvami had already explained how people enter hellish
life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it. Intelligent men must take advantage of
these instructions. Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking Krsna consciousness, and therefore
people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one. To
convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of
material enjoyment. Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them. Maharaja Pariksit is
the representative of one who can save them.
