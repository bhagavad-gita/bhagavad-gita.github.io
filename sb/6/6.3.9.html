<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
annam caranam acara
hy apadah pada-carinam
ahasta hasta-yuktanam
dvi-padam ca catus-padah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
annam--food; caranam--of those that move on wings; acarah--the nonmoving (fruits and flowers); hi--
indeed; apadah--the living entities without legs, like the grass; pada-carinam--of the animals who move on
legs, like the cows and buffalo; ahastah--animals without hands; hasta-yuktanam--of the animals with
hands, like the tigers; dvi-padam--of human beings, who have two legs; ca--and; catuh-padah--the fourlegged
animals like the deer.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By nature's arrangement, fruits and flowers are considered the food of insects and birds; grass and other
legless living entities are meant to be the food of four-legged animals like cows and buffalo; animals that
cannot use their front legs as hands are meant to be the food of animals like tigers, which have claws; and
four-legged animals like deer and goats, as well as food grains, are meant to be the food of human beings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By nature's law, or the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one kind of living entity is
eatable by other living entities. As mentioned herein, dvi-padam ca catus-padah: the four-legged animals
(catus-padah), as well as food grains, are eatables for human beings (dvi-padam). These four-legged
animals are those such as deer and goats, not cows, which are meant to be protected. Generally the men of
the higher classes of society--the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas--do not eat meat. Sometimes ksatriyas
go to the forest to kill animals like deer because they have to learn the art of killing, and sometimes they
eat the animals also. Sudras, too, eat animals such as goats. Cows, however, are never meant to be killed
or eaten by human beings. In every sastra, cow killing is vehemently condemned. Indeed, one who kills a
cow must suffer for as many years as there are hairs on the body of a cow. Manu-samhita says, pravrttir
esa bhutanam nivrttis tu maha-phala: we have many tendencies in this material world, but in human life
one is meant to learn how to curb those tendencies. Those who desire to eat meat may satisfy the
demands of their tongues by eating lower animals, but they should never kill cows, who are actually
accepted as the mothers of human society because they supply milk. The sastra especially recommends,
krsi-go-raksya: the vaisya section of humanity should arrange for the food of the entire society through
agricultural activities and should give full protection to the cows, which are the most useful animals
because they supply milk to human society.
