<h2>Text</h2>
ko 'tikramo 'nuvartantyah
svabhavam iha yositah
dhin mam batabudham svarthe
yad aham tv ajitendriyah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kah--what; atikramah--offense; anuvartantyah--following; sva-bhavam--her nature; iha--here; yositah--of
the woman; dhik--condemnation; mam--unto me; bata--alas; abudham--not conversant; sva-arthe--in
what is good for me; yat--because; aham--I; tu--indeed; ajita-indriyah--unable to control my senses.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This woman, my wife, has adopted a means that follows her nature, and therefore she is not to be
blamed. But I am a man. Therefore, all condemnation upon me! I am not at all conversant with what is
good for me, since I could not control my senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world. She induces her husband to enjoy this
world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called jihva, udara and upastha. A woman is
expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating. When one eats
nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong. Especially
when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly
becomes sexually inclined. It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual
progress but for gliding down to hell. Thus Kasyapa Muni considered his situation and lamented. In other
words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband. A
husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life. Kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan
iha (Bhag. 7.6.1). During the time of brahmacarya, or student life, a brahmacari should be taught to be
expert in bhagavata-dharma, devotional service. Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her
husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable.
However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense
gratification is not at all good. It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kaliyuga,
dam-patye 'bhirucir hetuh: the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual
power. Therefore householder life in this Kali-yuga is extremely dangerous unless both the wife and
husband take to Krsna consciousness.
