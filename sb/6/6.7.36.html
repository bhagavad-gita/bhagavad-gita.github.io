<h2>Text</h2>

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

and the collecting of grains left in the wholesale marketplace; tena--by that means; iha--here; nirvartita--
accomplishing; sadhu--of the exalted devotees; sat-kriyah--all the pious activities; katham--how;
vigarhyam--reproachable; nu--indeed; karomi--I shall execute; adhisvarah--O great governors of the
planetary systems; paurodhasam--the duty of priesthood; hrsyati--is pleased; yena--by which; durmatih--
one who is less intelligent.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O exalted governors of various planets, the true brahmana, who has no material possessions, maintains
himself by the profession of accepting silonchana. In other words, he picks up grains left in the field and
on the ground in the wholesale marketplace. By this means, householder brahmanas who actually abide
by the principles of austerity and penance maintain themselves and their families and perform all
necessary pious activities. A brahmana who desires to achieve happiness by gaining wealth through
professional priesthood must certainly have a very low mind. How shall I accept such priesthood?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A first-class brahmana does not accept any rewards from his disciples or yajamanas. Practicing
austerities and penances, he instead goes to the agricultural field and collects food grains left by the
agriculturalists to be collected by brahmanas. Similarly, such brahmanas go to marketplaces where grains
are purchased and sold wholesale, and there they collect grains left by the merchants. In this way, such
exalted brahmanas maintain their bodies and families. Such priests never demand anything from their
disciples to live in opulence, imitating ksatriyas or vaisyas. In other words, a pure brahmana voluntarily
accepts a life of poverty and lives in complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord. Not very many years
ago, a brahmana in Krsnanagara, near Navadvipa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, Vraja
Krsnacandra. The brahmana refused to accept the help. He said that since he was very happy in his
householder life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind leaves, there was
no question of taking help from the Zamindar. The conclusion is that although a brahmana may receive
much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal
benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
