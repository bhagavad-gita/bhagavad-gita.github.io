<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Prajapati Daksa, you have performed extreme austerities for the welfare and growth of the
world. My desire also is that everyone within this world be happy. I am therefore very pleased with you
because you are endeavoring to fulfill My desire for the welfare of the entire world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of
Karanodakasayi Visnu, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their
various species to resume their activities. Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living
entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material
nature? Here the Lord says to Daksa, "You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire."
The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected. All the living
entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain
within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again. There is a
chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of
this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death
again and again. This is the law of nature. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (15.7)
the Lord says:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entity's struggle for
existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature. Unless a living entity surrenders to
Krsna, he must continue this life of struggle.
The Krsna consciousness movement is not a fad. It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the
welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of Krsna consciousness. If
one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the
upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets. As confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 20.118),
kabhu svarge uthaya, kabhu narake dubaya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and
sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it. This is the life of the conditioned soul.
Prajapati Daksa is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a
chance for liberation. Liberation means surrender to Krsna. If one begets children with the purpose of
training them to surrender to Krsna, fatherhood is very good. Similarly, when the spiritual master trains
the conditioned souls to become Krsna conscious, his position is successful. If one gives the conditioned
souls a chance to become Krsna conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (prito 'ham). Following the examples of the previous
acaryas, all the members of the Krsna consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned
souls by inducing them to become Krsna conscious and giving them all facilities to do so. Such activities
constitute real welfare work. By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread Krsna
consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself confirms in
Bhagavad-gita (18.68-69):
ya idam paramam guhyam
mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati
bhaktim mayi param krtva
mam evaisyaty asamsayah
na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah
bhavita na ca me tasmad
anyah priyataro bhuvi
"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the
end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there
ever be one more dear."
