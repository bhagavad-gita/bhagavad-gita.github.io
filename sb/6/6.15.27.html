<h2>Text</h2>
sri-rudra uvaca
drstavaty asi susroni
harer adbhuta-karmanah
mahatmyam bhrtya-bhrtyanam
nihsprhanam mahatmanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-rudrah uvaca--Lord Siva said; drstavati asi--have you seen; su-sroni--O beautiful Parvati; hareh--of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adbhuta-karmanah--whose acts are wonderful; mahatmyam--the
greatness; bhrtya-bhrtyanam--of the servants of the servants; nihsprhanam--who are without ambitions
for sense gratification; mahatmanam--great souls.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva said: My dear beautiful Parvati, have you seen the greatness of the Vaisnavas? Being servants
of the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, they are great souls and are not interested in
any kind of material happiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva, the husband of Parvati, told his wife, "My dear Parvati, you are very beautiful in your bodily
features. Certainly you are glorious. But I do not think that you can compete with the beauty and glory of
devotees who have become servants of the servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Of course,
Lord Siva smiled when he joked with his wife in that way, for others cannot speak like that. "The
Supreme Lord," Siva continued, "is always exalted in His activities, and here is another example of His
wonderful influence upon King Citraketu, His devotee. Just see, although you cursed the King, he was not
at all afraid or sorry. Rather, he offered respect to you, called you mother and accepted your curse,
thinking himself faulty. He did not say anything in retaliation. This is the excellence of a devotee. By
mildly tolerating your curse, he has certainly excelled the glory of your beauty and your power to curse
him. I can impartially judge that this devotee, Citraketu, has defeated you and your excellence simply by
becoming a pure devotee of the Lord." As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, taror api sahisnuna. Just
like a tree, a devotee can tolerate all kinds of curses and reversals in life. This is the excellence of a
devotee. Indirectly, Lord Siva forbade Parvati to commit the mistake of cursing a devotee like Citraketu.
He indicated that although she was powerful, the King, without showing any power, had excelled her
power by his tolerance.
