TRANSLATION
Although Visvarupa was the son of the daughter of their eternal enemies the demons, the demigods
accepted him as their priest in accordance with the order of Brahma when they were abandoned by their
spiritual master, Brhaspati, whom they had disrespected.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Sixth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Progeny of the Daughters of Daksa."
Chapter Seven
Indra Offends His Spiritual Master, Brhaspati.
As related in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual
master, Brhaspati. Brhaspati therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest. However, at the request
of the demigods, Visvarupa, the son of the brahmana Tvasta, became their priest.
Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife Sacidevi and being praised
by various demigods like the Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the
demigods, entered the assembly. Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did
not respect Brhaspati, who thus became aware of Indra's pride in his material opulence and immediately
disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson. Indra became most repentant, understanding that
because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master. He left the palace to beg pardon
from his spiritual master, but could not find Brhaspati anywhere.
Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master. Indra lost all his opulence and was
conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra's throne. King
Indra, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahma. Understanding the situation,
Lord Brahma chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master. Following Lord Brahma's
orders, the demigods accepted Visvarupa, who was a brahmana and the son of Tvasta, as their priest.
Then they performed yajnas under the priesthood of Visvarupa and were able to conquer the demons.
