<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Alas, O Providence, O Creator, You are certainly inexperienced in creation, for during the lifetime of a
father You have caused the death of his son, thus acting in opposition to Your creative laws. If You are
determined to contradict these laws, You are certainly the enemy of living entities and are never merciful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the way a conditioned soul condemns the supreme creator when he meets reverses. Sometimes
he accuses the Supreme Personality of Godhead of being crooked because some people are happy and
some are not. Here the Queen blames supreme providence for her son's death. Following the creative
laws, a father should die first and then his son. If the creative laws are changed according to the whims of
providence, then providence certainly should not be considered merciful, but must be considered inimical
to the created being. Actually it is not the creator, but the conditioned soul who is inexperienced. He does
not know how the subtle laws of fruitive activity work, and without knowledge of these laws of nature, he
ignorantly criticizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
