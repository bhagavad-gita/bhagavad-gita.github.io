<h2>Text</h2>
prajanam pitaro ye ca
sastarah sadhavah samah
yadi syat tesu vaisamyam
kam yanti saranam prajah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prajanam--of the citizens; pitarah--protectors, guardians (kings or government servants); ye--they who;
ca--and; sastarah--give instructions concerning law and order; sadhavah--endowed with all good qualities;
samah--equal to everyone; yadi--if; syat--there is; tesu--among them; vaisamyam--partiality; kam--what;
yanti--will go to; saranam--shelter; prajah--the citizens.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and
protector of the citizens because of affection and love. He should give the citizens good advice and
instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone. Yamaraja does this, for
he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps. However, if such persons
become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the
citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching
them the proper goal of life. The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one's self and
one's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life.
The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a
gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship
with God. This principle was followed by kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Maharaja Pariksit, Lord
Ramacandra, Maharaja Ambarisa and Prahlada Maharaja. The leaders of the government must be very
honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer. Unfortunately, in the name of
democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the
government. Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and
dragged down from his post by the citizens. This is only one case, but there are many others. Because of
the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement, people should be Krsna conscious and should not
vote for anyone who is not Krsna conscious. Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state.
When a Vaisnava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries
his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare Krsna movement.
