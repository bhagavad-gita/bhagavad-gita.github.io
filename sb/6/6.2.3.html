TRANSLATION
My dear lord, you have described the dynasties and characteristics of King Priyavrata and King
Uttanapada. The Supreme Personality of Godhead created this material world with various universes,
planetary systems, planets and stars, with varied lands, seas, oceans, mountains, rivers, gardens and trees,
all with different characteristics. These are divided among this planet earth, the luminaries in the sky and
the lower planetary systems. You have very clearly described these planets and the living entities who live
on them.
PURPORT
Here the words yathedam asrjad vibhuh clearly indicate that the Supreme, the great, almighty
Personality of Godhead, created this entire material world with its different varieties of planets, stars and
so forth. Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot
explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty
power behind them. Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time. In Bhagavad-gita (10.8), the Lord
says, aham sarvasya prabhavo: "I am the origin of everything." Mattah sarvam pravartate: "whatever exists
in the creation emanates from Me." Iti matva bhajante mam budha bhava-samanvitah: "When one fully
understands that I create everything by My omnipotence, one becomes firmly situated in devotional
service and fully surrenders at My lotus feet." Unfortunately, the unintelligent cannot immediately
understand Krsna's supremacy. Nonetheless, if they associate with devotees and read authorized books,
they may gradually come to the proper understanding, although this may take many, many births. As
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.19):
bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be
the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." Vasudeva, Krsna, is the creator of
everything, and His energy is displayed in various ways. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5), a
combination of the material energy (bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh) and the spiritual energy, the living entity,
exists in every creation. Therefore the same principle, the combination of the supreme spirit and the
material elements, is the cause of the cosmic manifestation.
