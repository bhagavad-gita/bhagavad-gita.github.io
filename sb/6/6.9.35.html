<h2>Translation</h2>
These are our inquiries. The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus
receives the fruits of his actions. Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this
material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results
of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here
only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual
potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely
paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees.
These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth. When the Lord comes to punish the
demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them
relief, He also bestows His favor. Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls.
When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts
impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which
He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable. The Lord is apapa-viddham; He is never
contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities. When Krsna was present on this earth, He
killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received sarupya; in other words, they returned to their
original spiritual bodies. One who does not know the Lord's position says that God is unkind to him but
merciful to others. Actually the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu na me dvesyo
'sti na priyah: "I am equal to everyone. No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend." But He also says,
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te tesu capy aham: "If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders
unto Me, I give him special attention."
