<h2>Text</h2>
jiva uvaca

karmabhir bhramyamanasya
deva-tiryan-nr-yonisu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jivah uvaca--the living entity said; kasmin--in which; janmani--birth; ami--all those; mahyam--to me;
pitarah--fathers; matarah--mothers; abhavan--were; karmabhih--by the results of fruitive action;
bhramyamanasya--who am wandering; deva-tiryak--of the demigods and the lower animals; nr--and of the
human species; yonisu--in the wombs.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By the mystic power of Narada Muni, the living entity reentered his dead body for a short time and
spoke in reply to Narada Muni's request. He said: According to the results of my fruitive activities, I, the
living being, transmigrate from one body to another, sometimes going to the species of the demigods,
sometimes to the species of lower animals, sometimes among the vegetables, and sometimes to the human
species. Therefore, in which birth were these my mother and father? No one is actually my mother and
father. How can I accept these two people as my parents?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here it is made clear that the living being enters a material body that is like a machine created by the
five gross elements of material nature (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the three subtle elements (mind,
intelligence and ego). As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, there are two separate identities, called the inferior
and superior natures, which both belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to the results
of a living entity's fruitive actions, he is forced to enter the material elements in different types of bodies.
This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Maharaja Citraketu and Queen
Krtadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen.
Actually, however, he was not their son. The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to
enter various bodies. The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his
material father and mother. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through
different bodies. The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its
so-called creators. Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Maharaja Citraketu and his wife were his
father and mother.
