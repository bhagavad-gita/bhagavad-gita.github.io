<h2>Text</h2>
rupaudarya-vayo-janmavidyaisvarya-
sriyadibhih
sampannasya gunaih sarvais
cinta bandhya-pater abhut
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rupa--with beauty; audarya--magnanimity; vayah--youth; janma--aristocratic birth; vidya--education;
aisvarya--opulence; sriya-adibhih--wealth and so on; sampannasya--endowed; gunaih--with good qualities;
sarvaih--all; cinta--anxiety; bandhya-pateh--of Citraketu, the husband of so many sterile wives; abhut--
there was.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Citraketu, the husband of these millions of wives, was endowed with a beautiful form, magnanimity and
youth. He was born in a high family, he had a complete education, and he was wealthy and opulent.
Nevertheless, in spite of being endowed with all these assets, he was full of anxiety because he did not
have a son.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that the King first married one wife, but she could not bear a child. Then he married a
second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children. In spite of the material
assets of janmaisvarya-sruta-sri--birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and
beauty--he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son. Certainly
his grief was natural. Grhastha life does not mean having a wife and no children. Canakya Pandita says,
putra-hinam grham sunyam: if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert. The King was
certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times.
Ksatriyas especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so. Nonetheless, he had
no issue.
