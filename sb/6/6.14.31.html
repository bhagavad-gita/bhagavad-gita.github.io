<h2>Translation</h2>
As soon as Maharaja Citraketu saw the Supreme Lord, he was cleansed of all material contamination and
situated in his original Krsna consciousness, being completely purified. He became silent and grave, and
because of love for the Lord, tears fell from his eyes, and his hairs stood on end. With great devotion and
love, he offered his respectful obeisances unto the original Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word tad-darsana-dhvasta-samasta-kilbisah is very important in this verse. If one regularly sees the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple, one will gradually be disinfected of all material desires
simply by visiting the temple and seeing the Deity. When one is freed from all the results of sinful
activities, one will be purified, and with a healthy mind, completely cleansed, he will increasingly make
progress in Krsna consciousness.
