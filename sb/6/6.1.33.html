<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kasya--whose servants; va--or; kutah--from where; ayatah--have you come; kasmat--what is the reason;
asya--(the taking away) of this Ajamila; nisedhatha--are you forbidding; kim--whether; devah--demigods;
upadevah--sub-demigods; yah--who; yuyam--all of you; kim--whether; siddha-sat-tamah--the best of the
perfect beings, the pure devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear sirs, whose servants are you, where have you come from, and why are you forbidding us to touch
the body of Ajamila? Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the
best of devotees?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The most significant word used in this verse is siddha-sattamah, which means "the best of the perfect."
In Bhagavad-gita (7.3) it is said, manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye: out of millions of persons,
one may try to become siddha, perfect--or, in other words, self-realized. A self-realized person knows that
he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aham brahmasmi). At the present moment practically everyone is
unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha.
When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the
devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sat-tama. One is then eligible to live in the
Vaikuntha planets or Krsnaloka. The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee.
Since the Yamadutas are servants of Yamaraja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a
siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within
this material world. The Yamadutas therefore inquired why the Visnudutas were present where a sinful
man was going to die.
It should also be noted that Ajamila was not yet dead, for the Yamadutas were trying to snatch the soul
from his heart. They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Ajamila was not yet dead. This will
be revealed in later verses. Ajamila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in
progress between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas. The conclusion of the argument was to be a
decision regarding who would claim the soul of Ajamila.
