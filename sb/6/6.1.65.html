<h2>Text</h2>
vipram sva-bharyam apraudham
kule mahati lambhitam
visasarjacirat papah
svairinyapanga-viddha-dhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vipram--the daughter of a brahmana; sva-bharyam--his wife; apraudham--not very old (youthful); kule--
from a family; mahati--very respectable; lambhitam--married; visasarja--he gave up; acirat--very soon;
papah--being sinful; svairinya--of the prostitute; apanga-viddha-dhih--his intelligence pierced by the
lustful glance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because his intelligence was pierced by the lustful glance of the prostitute, the victimized brahmana
Ajamila engaged in sinful acts in her association. He even gave up the company of his very beautiful
young wife, who came from a very respectable brahmana family.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Customarily everyone is eligible to inherit his father's property, and Ajamila also inherited the money of
his father. But what did he do with the money? Instead of engaging the money in the service of Krsna, he
engaged it in the service of a prostitute. Therefore he was condemned and was punishable by Yamaraja.
How did this happen? He was victimized by the dangerous lustful glance of a prostitute.
