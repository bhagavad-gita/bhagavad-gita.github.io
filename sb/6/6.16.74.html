<h2>Text</h2>
aradhanam bhagavata
ihamana nirasisah
ye tu necchanty api param
te svartha-kusalah smrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aradhanam--the worship; bhagavatah--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ihamanah--being
interested in; nirasisah--without material desires; ye--those who; tu--indeed; na icchanti--do not desire;
api--even; param--liberation; te--they; sva-artha--in their own interest; kusalah--expert; smrtah--are
considered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although those who are interested only in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not
desire anything material from the Lord and do not even want liberation, Lord Krsna fulfills all their
desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja saw Lord Visnu, he declined to take any benedictions from Him, for he was
fully satisfied by seeing the Lord. Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that because Dhruva Maharaja, in the
beginning, had desired a kingdom greater than his father's, he was promoted to Dhruvaloka, the best
planet in the universe. Therefore in the sastra it is said:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"A person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of material desires, free from material desires,
or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead." (Bhag.
2.3.10) One should engage in full devotional service. Then, even though he has no desires, whatever
desires he previously had can all be fulfilled simply by his worship of the Lord. The actual devotee does
not desire even liberation (anyabhilasita-sunyam). The Lord, however, fulfills the desire of the devotee by
awarding him opulence that will never be destroyed. A karmi's opulence is destroyed, but the opulence of
a devotee is never destroyed. A devotee becomes more and more opulent as he increases his devotional
service to the Lord.
