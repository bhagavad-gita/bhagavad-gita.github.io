<h2>Translation</h2>
There are two ways to meet a glorious death, and both are very rare. One is to die after performing
mystic yoga, especially bhakti-yoga, by which one can control the mind and living force and die absorbed
in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The second is to die on the battlefield, leading the
army and never showing one's back. These two kinds of death are recommended in the sastra as glorious.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Sixth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Battle Between the Demigods and Vrtrasura."
Chapter Eleven
The Transcendental Qualities of Vrtrasura
This chapter describes Vrtrasura's great qualities. When the prominent commanders of the demons fled,
not hearing Vrtrasura's advice. Vrtrasura condemned them all as cowards. Speaking very bravely, he stood
alone to face the demigods. When the demigods saw Vrtrasura's attitude, they were so afraid that they
practically fainted, and Vrtrasura began trampling them down. Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of
the demigods, threw his club at Vrtrasura, but Vrtrasura was such a great hero that he easily caught the
club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra's elephant. Struck by the blow of Vrtrasura, the elephant
was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.
King Indra had first accepted Visvarupa as his priest and thereafter killed him. Reminding Indra of his
heinous activities, Vrtrasura said, "If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu,
and depends on Lord Visnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably
available. Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds. The Supreme Lord is so kind
that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional
service. Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord. I wish always to chant the
glories of the Lord and engage in His service. Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make
friendships with the devotees of the Lord. I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems,
even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world.
I have no need for such things."
