<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who fully surrender at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always think of
His lotus feet are accepted and recognized by the Lord as His own personal assistants or servants. The
Lord never bestows upon such servants the brilliant opulences of the upper, lower and middle planetary
systems of this material world. When one possesses material opulence in any of these three divisions of
the universe, his possessions naturally increase his enmity, anxiety, mental agitation, pride and
belligerence. Thus one goes through much endeavor to increase and maintain his possessions, and he
suffers great unhappiness when he loses them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says:
ye yatha mam prapadyante
tams tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah
"As devotees surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O
son of Prtha." Both Indra and Vrtrasura were certainly devotees of the Lord, although Indra took
instructions from Visnu to kill Vrtrasura. The Lord was actually more favorable to Vrtrasura because after
being killed by Indra's thunderbolt, Vrtrasura would go back to Godhead, whereas the victorious Indra
would rot in this material world. Because both of them were devotees, the Lord awarded them the
respective benedictions they wanted. Vrtrasura never wanted material possessions, for he knew very well
the nature of such possessions. To accumulate material possessions, one must labor very hard, and when
he gets them he creates many enemies because this material world is always full of rivalry. If one becomes
rich, his friends or relatives are envious. For ekanta-bhaktas, unalloyed devotees, Krsna therefore never
provides material possessions. A devotee sometimes needs some material possessions for preaching, but
the possessions of a preacher are not like those of a karmi. A karmi's possessions are achieved as a result
of karma, but those of a devotee are arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to facilitate his
devotional activities. Because a devotee never uses material possessions for any purpose other than the
service of the Lord, the possessions of a devotee are not to be compared to those of a karmi.
