sri-rajovaca
kathito vamsa-vistaro
bhavata soma-suryayoh
rajnam cobhaya-vamsyanam
caritam paramadbhutam
sri-raja uvaca--King Pariksit said; kathitah--has already been described; vamsa-vistarah--a broad description of
the dynasties; bhavata--by Your Lordship; soma-suryayoh--of the moon-god and the sun-god; rajnam--of the kings;
ca--and; ubhaya--both; vamsyanam--of the members of the dynasties; caritam--the character; parama--exalted;
adbhutam--and wonderful.
King Pariksit said: My dear lord, you have elaborately described the dynasties of both the moon-god and the sungod,
with the exalted and wonderful character of their kings.
At the end of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, Sukadeva Gosvami summarized the activities of Krsna.
He spoke of how Krsna had personally appeared to reduce the burden on the earth, how He had manifested His
pastimes as a householder, and how, soon after His birth, He had transferred Himself to His Vrajabhumi-lila.
Pariksit Maharaja, being naturally a devotee of Krsna, wanted to hear more about Lord Krsna. Therefore, to
encourage Sukadeva Gosvami to continue speaking about Krsna and give further details, he thanked Sukadeva
Gosvami for having described the activities of Krsna in brief. Sukadeva Gosvami had said:
jato gatah pitr-grhad vrajam edhitartho
hatva ripun suta-satani krtorudarah
utpadya tesu purusah kratubhih samije
atmanam atma-nigamam prathayan janesu
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-purusottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva
but immediately left His father's home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving relationships with His
confidential devotees. In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterward He returned to Dvaraka, where
according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds
of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life." (Bhag.
9.24.66)
The Yadu dynasty belonged to the family descending from Soma, the moon-god. Although the planetary systems
are so arranged that the sun comes first, before the moon, Pariksit Maharaja gave more respect to the dynasty of the
moon-god, the soma-vamsa, because in the Yadava dynasty, descending from the moon, Krsna had appeared. There
are two different ksatriya families of the royal order, one descending from the king of the moon planet and the
other descending from the king of the sun. Whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He generally
appears in a ksatriya family because He comes to establish religious principles and the life of righteousness.
According to the Vedic system, the ksatriya family is the protector of the human race. When the Supreme
Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord Ramacandra, He appeared in the surya-vamsa, the family descending
from the sun-god, and when He appeared as Lord Krsna, He did so in the Yadu dynasty, or yadu-vamsa, whose
descent was from the moon-god. In the Ninth Canto, Twenty-fourth Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, there is a
long list of the kings of the yadu-vamsa. All the kings in both the soma-vamsa and surya-vamsa were great and
powerful, and Maharaja Pariksit praised them very highly (rajnam cobhaya-vamsyanam caritam paramadbhutam).
Nonetheless, he wanted to hear more about the soma-vamsa because that was the dynasty in which Krsna had
appeared.
The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described in Brahma-samhita as the abode of
cintamani: cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksa-laksavrtesu surabhir abhipalayantam. The Vrndavana-dhama
on this earth is a replica of that same abode. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.20), in the spiritual sky there is another,
eternal nature, transcendental to manifested and unmanifested matter. The manifested world can be seen in the
form of many stars and planets such as the sun and moon, but beyond this is the unmanifested, which is
imperceptible to those who are embodied. And beyond this unmanifested matter is the spiritual kingdom, which is
described in Bhagavad-gita as supreme and eternal. That kingdom is never annihilated. Although material nature is
subject to repeated creation and annihilation, that spiritual nature remains as it is eternally. In the Tenth Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam, that spiritual nature, the spiritual world, is described as Vrndavana, Goloka Vrndavana or
Vraja-dhama. The elaborate description of the above-mentioned sloka from the Ninth Canto--jato gatah pitrgrhad--
will be found here, in the Tenth Canto.

yadoh--of Yadu or the Yadu dynasty; ca--also; dharma-silasya--who were strictly attached to religious principles;
nitaram--highly qualified; muni-sattama--O best of all munis, king of the munis (Sukadeva Gosvami); tatra--in that
dynasty; amsena--with His plenary expansion Baladeva; avatirnasya--who appeared as an incarnation; visnoh--of
Lord Visnu; viryani--the glorious activities; samsa--kindly describe; nah--unto us.
O best of munis, you have also described the descendants of Yadu, who were very pious and strictly adherent to
religious principles. Now, if you will, kindly describe the wonderful, glorious activities of Lord Visnu, or Krsna,
who appeared in that Yadu dynasty with Baladeva, His plenary expansion.
The Brahma-samhita (5.1) explains that Krsna is the origin of the visnu-tattva.
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the
origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes."
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"The Brahmas, the heads of the innumerable universes, live only for the duration of one breath of Maha-Visnu. I
worship Govinda, the original Lord, of whom Maha-Visnu is but a portion of a plenary portion." (Brahma-samhita
5.48)
Govinda, Krsna, is the original Personality of Godhead. Krsnas tu bhagavan svayam. Even Lord Maha-Visnu, who
by His breathing creates many millions upon millions of universes, is Lord Krsna's kala-visesa, or plenary portion
of a plenary portion. Maha-Visnu is a plenary expansion of Sankarsana, who is a plenary expansion of Narayana.
Narayana is a plenary expansion of the catur-vyuha, and the catur-vyuha are plenary expansions of Baladeva, the
first manifestation of Krsna. Therefore when Krsna appeared with Baladeva, all the visnu-tattvas appeared with
Him.
Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva Gosvami to describe Krsna and His glorious activities. Another meaning
may be derived from this verse as follows, Although Sukadeva Gosvami was the greatest muni, he could describe
Krsna only partially (amsena), for no one can describe Krsna fully. It is said that Anantadeva has thousands of
heads, but although He tries to describe Krsna with thousands of tongues, His descriptions are still incomplete.

avatirya yador vamse

avatirya--after descending; yadoh vamse--in the dynasty of Yadu; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
bhuta-bhavanah--who is the cause of the cosmic manifestation; krtavan--executed; yani--whatever (activities);
visva-atma--the Supersoul of the entire universe; tani--all of those (activities); nah--unto us; vada--kindly say;
vistarat--elaborately.
The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, the cause of the cosmic manifestation, appeared
in the dynasty of Yadu. Please tell me elaborately about His glorious activities and character, from the beginning to
the end of His life.
In this verse the words krtavan yani indicate that all the different activities Krsna performed while present on
earth are beneficial to human society. If religionists, philosophers and people in general simply hear the activities
of Krsna, they will be liberated. We have described several times that there are two kinds of krsna-katha,
represented by Bhagavad-gita, spoken personally by Krsna about Himself, and Srimad-Bhagavatam, spoken by
Sukadeva Gosvami about the glories of Krsna. Anyone who becomes even slightly interested in krsna-katha is
liberated. Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet (Bhag. 12.3.51). Simply by chanting or repeating
krsna-katha, one is liberated from the contamination of Kali-yuga. Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised, yare
dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa (Cc. Madhya 7.128). This is the mission of Krsna consciousness: to hear about
Krsna and thus be liberated from material bondage.

nivrtta-tarsair upagiyamanad

nivrtta--released from; tarsaih--lust or material activities; upagiyamanat--which is described or sung; bhavaausadhat--
which is the right medicine for the material disease; srotra--the process of aural reception; manah--the
subject matter of thought for the mind; abhiramat--from the pleasing vibrations from such glorification; kah--who;
uttamasloka--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; guna-anuvadat--from describing such activities; puman--a
person; virajyeta--can keep himself aloof; vina--except; pasu-ghnat--either a butcher or one who is killing his own
personal existence.
Glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is performed in the parampara system; that is, it is conveyed
from spiritual master to disciple. Such glorification is relished by those no longer interested in the false, temporary
glorification of this cosmic manifestation. Descriptions of the Lord are the right medicine for the conditioned soul
undergoing repeated birth and death. Therefore, who will cease hearing such glorification of the Lord except a
butcher or one who is killing his own self?
In India it is the practice among the general populace to hear about Krsna, either from Bhagavad-gita or from
Srimad-Bhagavatam, in order to gain relief from the disease of repeated birth and death. Although India is now
fallen, when there is a message that someone will speak about Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam, thousands of
people still gather to hear. This verse indicates, however, that such recitation of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam must be done by persons completely freed from material desires (nivrtta-tarsaih). Everyone within this
material world, beginning from Brahma down to the insignificant ant, is full of material desires for sense
enjoyment, and everyone is busy in sense gratification, but when thus engaged one cannot fully understand the
value of krsna-katha, either in the form of Bhagavad-gita or in Srimad-Bhagavatam.
If we hear the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from liberated persons, this hearing will certainly
free us from the bondage of material activities, but hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam spoken by a professional reciter
cannot actually help us achieve liberation. Krsna-katha is very simple. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that Krsna is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As He Himself explains, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: "O
Arjuna, there is no truth superior to Me." (Bg. 7.7) Simply by understanding this fact--that Krsna is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead--one can become a liberated person. But, especially in this age, because people are
interested in hearing Bhagavad-gita from unscrupulous persons who depart from the simple presentation of
Bhagavad-gita and distort it for their personal satisfaction, they fail to derive the real benefit. There are big scholars,
politicians, philosophers and scientists who speak on Bhagavad-gita in their own polluted way, and people in
general hear from them, being uninterested in hearing the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from a
devotee. A devotee is one who has no other motive for reciting Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam than to serve
the Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore advised us to hear the glories of the Lord from a realized person
(bhagavata paro diya bhagavata sthane). Unless one is personally a realized soul in the science of Krsna
consciousness, a neophyte should not approach him to hear about the Lord, for this is strictly forbidden by Srila
Sanatana Gosvami, who quotes from the padma purana:
avaisnava-mukhodgirnam
putam hari-kathamrtam
sravanam naiva kartavyam
sarpocchistam yatha payah
One should avoid hearing from a person not situated in Vaisnava behavior. A Vaisnava is nivrtta-trsna; that is, he
has no material purpose, for his only purpose is to preach Krsna consciousness. So-called scholars, philosophers
and politicians exploit the importance of Bhagavad-gita by distorting its meaning for their own purposes. Therefore
this verse warns that krsna-katha should be recited by a person who is nivrtta-trsna. Sukadeva Gosvami epitomizes
the proper reciter for Srimad-Bhagavatam, and Pariksit Maharaja, who purposefully left his kingdom and family
prior to meeting death, epitomizes the person fit to hear it. A qualified reciter of Srimad-Bhagavatam gives the right
medicine (bhavausadhi) for the conditioned souls. The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore trying to train
qualified preachers to recite Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita throughout the entire world, so that people in
general in all parts of the world may take advantage of this movement and thus be relieved of the threefold miseries
of material existence.
The instructions of Bhagavad-gita and the descriptions of Srimad-Bhagavatam are so pleasing that almost anyone
suffering from the threefold miseries of material existence will desire to hear the glories of the Lord from these
books and thus benefit on the path of liberation. Two classes of men, however, will never be interested in hearing
the message of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam--those who are determined to commit suicide and those
determined to kill cows and other animals for the satisfaction of their own tongues. Although such persons may
make a show of hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam at a Bhagavata-saptaha, this is but another creation of the karmis, who
cannot derive any benefit from such a performance. The word pasu-ghnat is important in this connection. pasughna
means "butcher." Persons fond of performing ritualistic ceremonies for elevation to the higher planetary
systems must offer sacrifices (yajnas) by killing animals. Lord Buddhadeva therefore rejected the authority of the
Vedas because his mission was to stop animal sacrifices, which are recommended in Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.
nindasi yajna-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam
sa-daya-hrdaya darsita-pasu-ghatam
kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagadisa hare
(Gita-govinda)
Even though animal sacrifices are sanctioned in Vedic ceremonies, men who kill animals for such ceremonies are
considered butchers. Butchers cannot be interested in Krsna consciousness, for they are already materially allured.
Their only interest lies in developing comforts for the temporary body.
bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam
tayapahrta-cetasam
vyavasayatmika buddhih
samadhau na vidhiyate
"In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered
by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place." (Bg.
2.44) Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says:
manusya-janama paiya, radha-krsna na bhajiya,
janiya suniya visa khainu
Anyone who is not Krsna conscious and who therefore does not engage in the service of the Lord is also pasughna,
for he is willingly drinking poison. Such a person cannot be interested in krsna-katha because he still has a
desire for material sense gratification; he is not nivrtta-trsna. As it is said, traivargikas te purusa vimukha harimedhasah.
Those interested in trivarga--that is, in dharma, artha and kama--are religious for the sake of achieving a
material position with which to gain better facilities for sense gratification. Such persons are killing themselves by
willingly keeping themselves in the cycle of birth and death. They cannot be interested in Krsna consciousness.
For krsna-katha, topics about Krsna consciousness, there must be a speaker and a hearer, both of whom can be
interested in Krsna consciousness if they are no longer interested in material topics. One can actually see how this
attitude automatically develops in persons who are Krsna conscious. Although the devotees of the Krsna
consciousness movement are quite young men, they no longer read materialistic newspapers, magazines and so on,
for they are no longer interested in such topics (nivrtta-tarsaih). They completely give up the bodily understanding
of life. For topics concerning Uttamasloka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master speaks, and
the disciple hears with attention. Unless both of them are free from material desires, they cannot be interested in
topics of Krsna consciousness. The spiritual master and disciple do not need to understand anything more than
Krsna because simply by understanding Krsna and talking about Krsna, one becomes a perfectly learned person
(yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati). The Lord sits within everyone's heart, and by the grace of the Lord
the devotee receives instructions directly from the Lord Himself, who says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas,
I am to be known; indeed, I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas." Krsna consciousness
is so exalted that one who is perfectly situated in Krsna consciousness, under the direction of the spiritual master,
is fully satisfied by reading krsna-katha as found in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and similar Vedic
literatures. Since merely talking about Krsna is so pleasing, we can simply imagine how pleasing it is to render
service to Krsna.
When discourses on krsna-katha take place between a liberated spiritual master and his disciple, others also
sometimes take advantage of hearing these topics and also benefit. These topics are the medicine to stop the
repetition of birth and death. The cycle of repeated birth and death, by which one takes on different bodies again
and again, is called bhava or bhava-roga. If anyone, willingly or unwillingly, hears krsna-katha, his bhava-roga, the
disease of birth and death, will certainly stop. Therefore krsna-katha is called bhavausadha, the remedy to stop the
repetition of birth and death. Karmis, or persons attached to material sense enjoyment, generally cannot give up
their material desires, but krsna-katha is such a potent medicine that if one is induced to hear krsna-kirtana, he
will certainly be freed from this disease. A practical example is Dhruva Maharaja, who at the end of his tapasya was
fully satisfied. When the Lord wanted to give Dhruva a benediction, Dhruva refused it. Svamin krtartho'smi varam
na yace. "My dear Lord," he said, "I am fully satisfied. I do not ask for any benediction for material sense
gratification." We actually see that even young boys and girls in the Krsna consciousness movement have given up
their long practice of bad habits like illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Because Krsna
consciousness is so potent that it gives them full satisfaction, they are no longer interested in material sense
gratification.

Taking the boat of Krsna's lotus feet, my grandfather Arjuna and others crossed the ocean of the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra, in which such commanders as Bhismadeva resembled great fish that could very easily have swallowed
them. By the mercy of Lord Krsna, my grandfathers crossed this ocean, which was very difficult to cross, as easily
as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf. Because my mother surrendered unto Lord Krsna's lotus feet, the Lord,
Sudarsana-cakra in hand, entered her womb and saved my body, the body of the last remaining descendant of the
Kurus and the Pandavas, which was almost destroyed by the fiery weapon of Asvatthama. Lord Sri Krsna,
appearing within and outside of all materially embodied living beings by His own potency in the forms of eternal
time--that is, as Paramatma and as virat-rupa--gave liberation to everyone, either as cruel death or as life. Kindly
enlighten me by describing His transcendental characteristics.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.58):
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation
and is famous as Murari, or the enemy of the Mura demon, the ocean of the material world is like the water
contained in a calf's hoofprint. His goal is param padam, or Vaikuntha, the place where there are no material
miseries, not the place where there is danger at every step."
One who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna is immediately protected by the Lord. As the Lord promises
in Bhagavad-gita (18.66), aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah: "I shall deliver you from all sinful
reactions. Do not fear." By taking shelter of Lord Krsna, one comes under the safest protection. Thus when the
Pandavas took shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna, all of them were on the safe side of the Battlefield of Kuruksetra.
Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, felt obliged to think of Krsna in the last days of his life. This is the ideal result of
Krsna consciousness: ante narayana-smrtih. If at the time of death one can remember Krsna, one's life is successful.
Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, because of his many obligations to Krsna, intelligently decided to think of Krsna
constantly during the last days of his life. Krsna had saved the Pandavas, Maharaja Pariksit's grandfathers, on the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra, and Krsna had saved Maharaja Pariksit himself when he was attacked by the brahmastra
of Asvatthama. Krsna acted as the friend and worshipable Deity of the Pandava family. Moreover, apart from Lord
Krsna's personal contact with the Pandavas, Krsna is the Supersoul of all living entities, and He gives everyone
liberation, even if one is not a pure devotee. Kamsa, for example, was not at all a devotee, yet Krsna, after killing
him, gave him salvation. Krsna consciousness is beneficial to everyone, whether one is a pure devotee or a
nondevotee. This is the glory of Krsna consciousness. Considering this, who will not take shelter at the lotus feet of
Krsna. Krsna is described in this verse as maya-manusya because He descends exactly like a human being. He is not
obliged to come here, like karmis, or ordinary living beings; rather, He appears by His own internal energy
(sambhavamy atma-mayaya) just to show favor to the fallen conditioned souls. Krsna is always situated in His
original position as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, and anyone who renders service to Him is also situated in his original,
spiritual identity (svarupena vyavasthitih). This is the highest perfection of human life.

My dear Sukadeva Gosvami, you have already explained that Sankarsana, who belongs to the second quadruple,
appeared as the son of Rohini named Balarama. If Balarama was not transferred from one body to another, how is it
possible that He was first in the womb of Devaki and then in the womb of Rohini? Kindly explain this to me.
Here is a question particularly directed at understanding Balarama, who is Sankarsana Himself. Balarama is well
known as the son of Rohini, yet it is also known that He was the son of Devaki. Pariksit Maharaja wanted to
understand the mystery of Balarama's being the son of both Devaki and Rohini.

Why did Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, leave the house of His father, Vasudeva, and transfer
Himself to the house of Nanda in Vrndavana? Where did the Lord, the master of the Yadu dynasty, live with His
relatives in Vrndavana?
These are inquiries about the itinerary of Krsna. Just after His birth in the house of Vasudeva in Mathura, Krsna
transferred Himself to Gokula, on the other side of the Yamuna, and after some days He moved with His father,
mother and other relatives to Nanda-grama, Vrndavana. Maharaja Pariksit was very much eager to hear about
Krsna's activities in Vrndavana. This entire canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam is full of activities performed in Vrndavana
and Dvaraka. The first forty chapters describe Krsna's Vrndavana affairs, and the next fifty describe Krsna's
activities in Dvaraka. Maharaja Pariksit, to fulfill his desire to hear about Krsna, requested Sukadeva Gosvami to
describe these activities in full detail.

One's maternal uncle, the brother of one's mother, is on the level of one's father. When a maternal uncle has no
son, his nephew legally inherits his property. Therefore, why did Krsna directly kill Kamsa, the brother of His

Because of my vow on the verge of death, I have given up even drinking water, yet because I am drinking the
nectar of topics about Krsna, which is flowing from the lotus mouth of Your Lordship, my hunger and thirst, which
are extremely difficult to bear, cannot hinder me.
To prepare to meet death in seven days, Maharaja Pariksit gave up all food and drink. As a human being, he was
certainly both hungry and thirsty, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami might have wanted to stop narrating the
transcendental topics of Krsna; but despite his fast, Maharaja Pariksit was not at all fatigued. "The hunger and
thirst from my fast do not disturb me," he said. "Once when I felt very thirsty, I went to the asrama of Samika Muni
to drink water, but the muni did not supply it. I therefore wrapped a dead snake over his shoulder, and that is why
I was cursed by the brahmana boy. Now, however, I am quite fit. I am not at all disturbed by my hunger and
thirst." This indicates that although on the material platform there are disturbances from hunger and thirst, on the
spiritual platform there is no such thing as fatigue.
The entire world is suffering because of spiritual thirst. Every living being is Brahman, or spirit soul, and needs
spiritual food to satisfy his hunger and thirst. Unfortunately, however, the world is completely unaware of the
nectar of krsna-katha. The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore a boon to philosophers, religionists and
people in general. There is certainly a charming attraction in Krsna and krsna-katha. Therefore the Absolute Truth
is called Krsna, the most attractive.
The word amrta is also an important reference to the moon, and the word ambuja means "lotus." The pleasing
moonshine and pleasing fragrance of the lotus combined to bring pleasure to everyone hearing krsna-katha from
the mouth of Sukadeva Gosvami. As it is said:
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho 'bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
"Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish
conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed. Their inclinations toward Krsna are never
aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both." (Bhag. 7.5.30) At
the present moment, all of human society is engaged in the business of chewing the chewed (punah punas carvitacarvananam).
People are prepared to undergo mrtyu-samsara-vartmani, taking birth in one form, dying, accepting
another form and dying again. To stop this repetition of birth and death, krsna-katha, or Krsna consciousness, is
absolutely necessary. But unless one hears krsna-katha from a realized soul like Sukadeva Gosvami, one cannot
relish the nectar of krsna-katha, which puts an end to all material fatigue, and enjoy the blissful life of
transcendental existence. In relation to the Krsna consciousness movement, we actually see that those who have
tasted the nectar of krsna-katha lose all material desires, whereas those who cannot understand Krsna or krsnakatha
regard the Krsna conscious life as "brainwashing" and "mind control." While the devotees enjoy spiritual
bliss, the nondevotees are surprised that the devotees have forgotten material hankerings.

Suta Gosvami said: O son of Bhrgu [Saunaka Rsi], after Sukadeva Gosvami, the most respectable devotee, the son
of Vyasadeva, heard the pious questions of Maharaja Pariksit, he thanked the King with great respect. Then he
began to discourse on topics concerning Krsna, which are the remedy for all sufferings in this age of Kali.
In this verse the words krsna-caritam kali-kalmasa-ghnam indicate that the activities of Lord Krsna are certainly
the greatest panacea for all miseries, especially in this age of Kali. It is said that in Kali-yuga people have only short
lives, and they have no culture of spiritual consciousness. If anyone is at all interested in spiritual culture, he is
misled by many bogus svamis and yogis who do not refer to krsna-katha. Therefore most people are unfortunate
and disturbed by many calamities. Srila Vyasadeva prepared Srimad-Bhagavatam at the request of Narada Muni in
order to give relief to the suffering people of this age (kali-kalmasa-ghnam). The Krsna consciousness movement is
seriously engaged in enlightening people through the pleasing topics of Srimad-Bhagavatam. All over the world, the
message of Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita is being accepted in all spheres of life, especially in advanced,
educated circles.
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami is described in this verse as bhagavata-pradhanah, whereas Maharaja Pariksit is described
as visnu-ratam. Both words bear the same meaning; that is, Maharaja Pariksit was a great devotee of Krsna, and
Sukadeva Gosvami was also a great saintly person and a great devotee of Krsna. Combined together to present
krsna-katha, they give great relief to suffering humanity.

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Your Majesty, best of all saintly kings, because you are greatly attracted to topics
of Vasudeva, it is certain that your intelligence is firmly fixed in spiritual understanding, which is the only true goal
for humanity. Because that attraction is unceasing, it is certainly sublime.
Krsna-katha is compulsory for the rajarsi, or executive head of government. This is also mentioned in Bhagavadgita
(imam rajarsayo viduh). Unfortunately, however, in this age the governmental power is gradually being
captured by third-class and fourth-class men who have no spiritual understanding, and society is therefore very
quickly becoming degraded. Krsna-katha must be understood by the executive heads of government, for otherwise
how will people be happy and gain relief from the pangs of materialistic life? One who has fixed his mind in Krsna
consciousness should be understood to have very sharp intelligence in regard to the value of life. Maharaja Pariksit
was rajarsi-sattama, the best of all saintly kings, and Sukadeva Gosvami was muni-sattama, the best of munis. Both
of them were elevated because of their common interest in krsna-katha. The exalted position of the speaker and the
audience will be explained very nicely in the next verse. Krsna-katha is so enlivening that Maharaja Pariksit forgot
everything material, even his personal comfort in relation to food and drink. This is an example of how the Krsna
consciousness movement should spread all over the world to bring both the speaker and the audience to the
transcendental platform and back home, back to Godhead.

The Ganges, emanating from the toe of Lord Visnu, purifies the three worlds, the upper, middle and lower

Krsna, three varieties of men are purified: the speaker or preacher, he who inquires, and the people in general who
listen.
It is said, tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam (Bhag. 11.3.21). Those interested in understanding
transcendental subject matters as the goal of life must approach the bona fide spiritual master. Tasmad gurum
prapadyeta. One must surrender to such a guru, who can give right information about Krsna. Herein, Maharaja
Pariksit has surrendered to the right personality, Sukadeva Gosvami, for enlightenment in vasudeva-katha.
Vasudeva is the original Personality of Godhead, who has unlimited spiritual activities. Srimad-Bhagavatam is a
record of such activities, and Bhagavad-gita is the record of Vasudeva speaking personally. Therefore, since the
Krsna consciousness movement is full of vasudeva-katha, anyone who hears, anyone who joins the movement and
anyone who preaches will be purified.

Once when mother earth was overburdened by hundreds of thousands of military phalanxes of various conceited
demons dressed like kings, she approached Lord Brahma for relief.
When the world is overburdened by unnecessary military arrangements and when various demoniac kings are
the executive heads of state, this burden causes the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I appear Myself." When the residents of this earth become atheistic and godless, they
descend to the status of animals like dogs and hogs, and thus their only business is to bark among themselves. This
is dharmasya glani, deviation from the goal of life. Human life is meant for attaining the highest perfection of Krsna
consciousness, but when people are godless and the presidents or kings are unnecessarily puffed up with military
power, their business is to fight and increase the military strength of their different states. Nowadays, therefore, it
appears that every state is busy manufacturing atomic weapons to prepare for a third world war. Such preparations
are certainly unnecessary; they reflect the false pride of the heads of state. The real business of a chief executive is
to see to the happiness of the mass of people by training them in Krsna consciousness in different divisions of life.
Catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg. 4.13). A leader should train the people as brahmanas,
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras and engage them in various occupational duties, thus helping them progress toward
Krsna consciousness. Instead, however, rogues and thieves in the guise of protectors arrange for a voting system,
and in the name of democracy they come to power by hook or crook and exploit the citizens. Even long, long ago,
asuras, persons devoid of God consciousness, became the heads of state, and now this is happening again. The
various states of the world are preoccupied with arranging for military strength. Sometimes they spend sixty-five
percent of the government's revenue for this purpose. But why should people's hard-earned money be spent in this
way? Because of the present world situation, Krsna has descended in the form of the Krsna consciousness
movement. This is quite natural, for without the Krsna consciousness movement the world cannot be peaceful and
happy.

After reaching the shore of the ocean of milk, the demigods worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord
Visnu, the master of the whole universe, the supreme God of all gods, who provides for everyone and diminishes
everyone's suffering. With great attention, they worshiped Lord Visnu, who lies on the ocean of milk, by reciting
the Vedic mantras known as the Purusa-sukta.
The demigods, such as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, King Indra, Candra and Surya, are all subordinate to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Aside from the demigods, even in human society there are many influential
personalities supervising various businesses or establishments. Lord Visnu, however, is the God of gods
(paramesvara). He is parama-purusa, the Supreme Being, Paramatma. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.1),
isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah: "Krsna, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an
eternal, blissful, spiritual body." No one is equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
therefore He is described here by many words: jagannatha, deva-deva, vrsakapi and purusa. The supremacy of Lord
Visnu is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.12) in this statement by Arjuna:
param brahma param dhama
pavitram paramam bhavan
purusam sasvatam divyam
adi-devam ajam vibhum
"You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal
divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading
beauty." Krsna is adi-purusa, the original Personality of Godhead (govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami).
Visnu is a plenary expansion of Lord Krsna, and all the visnu-tattvas are paramesvara, deva-deva.

While in trance, Lord Brahma heard the words of Lord Visnu vibrating in the sky. Thus he told the demigods: O
demigods, hear from me the order of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Supreme Person, and execute it attentively without
delay.
It appears that the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be heard in trance by competent persons.
Modern science gives us telephones, by which one can hear sound vibrations from a distant place. Similarly,
although other persons cannot hear the words of Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma is able to hear the Lord's words within
himself. This is confirmed in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.1): tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye. Adikavi
is Lord Brahma. In the beginning of the creation, Lord Brahma received the instructions of Vedic knowledge
from Lord Visnu through the medium of the heart (hrda). The same principle is confirmed herewith. While
Brahma was in trance, he was able to hear the words of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and he carried the Lord's message to
the demigods. Similarly, in the beginning, Brahma first received the Vedic knowledge from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through the core of the heart. In both instances the same process was used in transmitting
the message to Lord Brahma. In other words, although Lord Visnu was invisible even to Lord Brahma, Lord
Brahma could hear Lord Visnu's words through the heart. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is invisible even to
Lord Brahma, yet He descends on this earth and becomes visible to people in general. This is certainly an act of His
causeless mercy, but fools and nondevotees think that Krsna is an ordinary historical person. Because they think
that the Lord is an ordinary person like them, they are described as mudha (avajananti mam mudhah). The
causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is neglected by such demoniac persons, who cannot
understand the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and who therefore misinterpret them.

Lord Brahma informed the demigods: Before we submitted our petition to the Lord, He was already aware of the
distress on earth. Consequently, for as long as the Lord moves on earth to diminish its burden by His own potency
in the form of time, all of you demigods should appear through plenary portions as sons and grandsons in the
family of the Yadus.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.39):
ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan
nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu
krsnah svayam samabhavat paramah puman yo
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is always situated in various incarnations such as
Rama, Nrsimha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original personality of Godhead, known as
Krsna, and who incarnates personally also."
In this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam we find the words puraiva pumsavadhrto dhara jvarah. The word pumsa
refers to Krsna, who was already aware of how the whole world was suffering because of the increase of demons.
Without reference to the supreme power of the Personality of Godhead, demons assert themselves to be
independent kings and presidents, and thus they create a disturbance by increasing their military power. When
such disturbances are very prominent, Krsna appears. At present also, various demoniac states all over the world
are increasing their military power in many ways, and the whole situation has become distressful. Therefore Krsna
has appeared by His name, in the Hare Krsna movement, which will certainly diminish the burden of the world.
Philosophers, religionists, and people in general must take to this movement very seriously, for man-made plans
and devices will not help bring peace on earth. The transcendental sound Hare Krsna is not different from the
person Krsna.
nama cintamanih krsnas

There is no difference between the sound Hare Krsna and Krsna the person.

parah--who is transcendental; janisyate--will appear; tat-priya-artham--and for His satisfaction; sambhavantu--

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who has full potency, will personally appear as the son of
Vasudeva. Therefore all the wives of the demigods should also appear in order to satisfy Him.
In Bhagavad-gita (4.9) the Lord says, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: after giving up the material
body, the devotee of the Lord returns home, back to Godhead. This means that the devotee is first transferred to
the particular universe where the Lord is at that time staying to exhibit His pastimes. There are innumerable
universes, and the Lord is appearing in one of these universes at every moment. Therefore His pastimes are called
nitya-lila, eternal pastimes. The Lord's appearance as a child in the house of Devaki takes place continuously in one
universe after another. Therefore, the devotee is first transferred to that particular universe where the pastimes of
the Lord are current. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, even if a devotee does not complete the course of devotional
service, he enjoys the happiness of the heavenly planets, where the most pious people dwell, and then takes birth
in the house of a suci or sriman, a pious brahmana or a wealthy vaisya (sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto
'bhijayate). Thus a pure devotee, even if unable to execute devotional service completely, is transferred to the
upper planetary system, where pious people reside. From there, if his devotional service is complete, such a
devotee is transferred to the place where the Lord's pastimes are going on. Herein it is said, sambhavantu surastriyah.
Sura-stri, the women of the heavenly planets, were thus ordered to appear in the Yadu dynasty in
Vrndavana to enrich the pastimes of Lord Krsna. These sura-stri, when further trained to live with Krsna, would be
transferred to the original Goloka Vrndavana. During Lord Krsna's pastimes within this world, the sura-stri were to
appear in different ways in different families to give pleasure to the Lord, just so that they would be fully trained
before going to the eternal Goloka Vrndavana. With the association of Lord Krsna, either at Dvaraka-puri,
Mathura-puri or Vrndavana, they would certainly return home, back to Godhead. Among the sura-stri, the women
of the heavenly planets, there are many devotees, such as the mother of the Upendra incarnation of Krsna. It was
such devoted women who were called for in this connection.

Sri Baladeva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. He is equal in supremacy to the Supreme Godhead,
yet wherever Krsna appears, Sri Baladeva appears as His brother, sometimes elder and sometimes younger. When
Krsna appears, all His plenary expansions and other incarnations appear with Him. This is elaborately explained in
Caitanya-caritamrta. This time, Baladeva would appear before Krsna as Krsna's elder brother.

visnor maya bhagavati

visnoh maya--the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu; bhagavati--as good as Bhagavan and
therefore known as Bhagavati; yaya--by whom; sammohitam--captivated; jagat--all the worlds, both material and
spiritual; adista--being ordered; prabhuna--by the master; amsena--with her different potential factors; karyaarthe--
for executing business; sambhavisyati--would also appear.
The potency of the Lord, known as visnu-maya, who is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will also
appear with Lord Krsna. This potency, acting in different capacities, captivates all the worlds, both material and
spiritual. At the request of her master, she will appear with her different potencies in order to execute the work of
the Lord.
Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8). In the Vedas it is said that the potencies of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead are called by different names, such as yogamaya and mahamaya. Ultimately,
however, the Lord's potency is one, exactly as electric potency is one although it can act both to cool and to heat.
The Lord's potency acts in both the spiritual and material worlds. In the spiritual world the Lord's potency works
as yogamaya, and in the material world the same potency works as mahamaya, exactly as electricity works in both a
heater and a cooler. In the material world, this potency, working as mahamaya, acts upon the conditioned souls to
deprive them more and more of devotional service. It is said, yaya sammohito jiva atmanam tri-gunatmakam. In the
material world the conditioned soul thinks of himself as a product of tri-guna, the three modes of material nature.
This is the bodily conception of life. Because of associating with the three gunas of the material potency, everyone
identifies himself with his body. Someone is thinking he is a brahmana, someone a ksatriya, and someone a vaisya
or sudra. Actually, however, one is neither a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya nor a sudra; one is part and parcel of
the Supreme Lord (mamaivamsah), but because of being covered by the material energy, mahamaya, one identifies
himself in these different ways. When the conditioned soul becomes liberated, however, he thinks himself an
eternal servant of Krsna. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa.' When he comes to that position, the same
potency, acting as yogamaya, increasingly helps him become purified and devote his energy to the service of the
Lord.
In either case, whether the soul is conditioned or liberated, the Lord is supreme. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(9.10), mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: it is by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that
the material energy, mahamaya, works upon the conditioned soul.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the
doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27) Within conditioned life, no one has
freedom, but because one is bewildered, being subject to the rule of mahamaya, one foolishly thinks himself
independent (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate). But when the conditioned soul becomes liberated by
executing devotional service, he is given a greater and greater chance to relish a relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in different transcendental statuses, such as dasya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vatsalya-rasa and
madhurya-rasa.
Thus the Lord's potency, visnu-maya, has two features--avaranika and unmukha. When the Lord appeared, His
potency came with Him and acted in different ways. She acted as yogamaya with Yasoda, Devaki and other intimate
relations of the Lord, and she acted in a different way with Kamsa, Salva and other asuras. By the order of Lord
Krsna, His potency yogamaya came with Him and exhibited different activities according to the time and
circumstances. Karyarthe sambhavisyati. Yogamaya acted differently to execute different purposes desired by the
Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.13), mahatmanas tu mam partha daivim prakrtim asritah. The mahatmas,
who fully surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, are directed by yogamaya, whereas the duratmas, those who are
devoid of devotional service, are directed by mahamaya.

connected, living eternally; harih--the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Since that time, the city of Mathura had been the capital of all the kings of the Yadu dynasty. The city and district
of Mathura are very intimately connected with Krsna, for Lord Krsna lives there eternally.
It is understood that Mathura City is the transcendental abode of Lord Krsna; it is not an ordinary material city,
for it is eternally connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vrndavana is within the jurisdiction of
Mathura, and it still continues to exist. Because Mathura and Vrndavana are intimately connected with Krsna
eternally, it is said that Lord Krsna never leaves Vrndavana (vrndavanam parityajya padam ekam na gacchati). At
present, the place known as Vrndavana, in the district of Mathura, continues its position as a transcendental place,
and certainly anyone who goes there becomes transcendentally purified. Navadvipa-dhama is also intimately
connected with Vrajabhumi. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says:
sri gauda-mandala-bhumi, yeba jane cintamani,
ta'ra haya vrajabhume vasa
"Vrajabhumi" refers to Mathura-Vrndavana, and Gauda-mandala-bhumi includes Navadvipa. These two places
are nondifferent. Therefore, anyone living in Navadvipa-dhama, knowing Krsna and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
be the same personality, lives in Vrajabhumi, Mathura-Vrndavana. The Lord has made it convenient for the
conditioned soul to live in Mathura, Vrndavana and Navadvipa and thus be directly connected with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Simply by living in these places, one can immediately come in contact with the Lord.
There are many devotees who vow never to leave Vrndavana and Mathura. This is undoubtedly a good vow, but if
one leaves Vrndavana, Mathura or Navadvipa-dhama for the service of the Lord, he is not disconnected from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. At any rate, we must understand the transcendental importance of Mathura-
Vrndavana and Navadvipa-dhama. Anyone who executes devotional service in these places certainly goes back
home, back to Godhead, after giving up his body. Thus the words mathura bhagavan yatra nityam sannihito harih
are particularly important. A devotee should fully utilize this instruction to the best of his ability. Whenever the
Supreme Lord personally appears, He appears in Mathura because of His intimate connection with this place.
Therefore although Mathura and Vrndavana are situated on this planet earth, they are transcendental abodes of the
Lord.

Devaki's father, King Devaka, was very much affectionate to his daughter. Therefore, while she and her husband
were leaving home, he gave her a dowry of four hundred elephants nicely decorated with golden garlands. He also
gave ten thousand horses, eighteen hundred chariots, and two hundred very beautiful young maidservants, fully
decorated with ornaments.
The system of giving a dowry to one's daughter has existed in Vedic civilization for a very long time. Even today,
following the same system, a father who has money will give his daughter an opulent dowry. A daughter would
never inherit the property of her father, and therefore an affectionate father, during the marriage of his daughter,
would give her as much as possible. A dowry, therefore, is never illegal according to the Vedic system. Here, of
course, the gift offered as a dowry by Devaka to Devaki was not ordinary. Because Devaka was a king, he gave a
dowry quite suitable to his royal position. Even an ordinary man, especially a high-class brahmana, ksatriya or
vaisya, is supposed to give his daughter a liberal dowry. Immediately after the marriage, the daughter goes to her
husband's house, and it is also a custom for the brother of the bride to accompany his sister and brother-in-law to
exhibit affection for her. This system was followed by Kamsa. These are all old customs in the society of
varnasrama-dharma, which is now wrongly designated as Hindu. These long-standing customs are nicely described
here.

While Kamsa, controlling the reins of the horses, was driving the chariot along the way, an unembodied voice
addressed him, "You foolish rascal, the eighth child of the woman you are carrying will kill you!"
The omen spoke of astamo garbhah, referring to the eighth pregnancy, but did not clearly say whether the child
was to be a son or a daughter. Even if Kamsa were to see that the eighth child of Devaki was a daughter, he should
have no doubt that the eighth child was to kill him. According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word garbha means
"embryo" and also arbhaka, or "child." Kamsa was affectionate toward his sister, and therefore he had become the
chariot driver to carry her and his brother-in-law to their home. The demigods, however, did not want Kamsa to be
affectionate toward Devaki, and therefore, from an unseen position, they encouraged Kamsa to offend her.
Moreover, the six sons of Marici had been cursed to take birth from the womb of Devaki, and upon being killed by
Kamsa they would be delivered. When Devaki understood that Kamsa would be killed by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who would appear from her womb, she felt great joy. The word vahase is also significant because it
indicates that the ominous vibration condemned Kamsa for acting just like a beast of burden by carrying his
enemy's mother.

Kamsa was driving the chariot and controlling the reins with his left hand, but as soon as he heard the omen that
his sister's eighth child would kill him, he gave up the reins, caught hold of his sister's hair, and with his right hand
took up a sword to kill her. Before, he had been so affectionate that he was acting as his sister's chariot driver, but
as soon as he heard that his self-interest or his life was at risk, he forgot all affection for her and immediately
became a great enemy. This is the nature of demons. No one should trust a demon, despite any amount of
affection. Aside from this, a king, a politician or a woman cannot be trusted, since they can do anything
abominable for their personal interest. Canakya Pandita therefore says, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu

According to Vedic principles, a brahmana, an old man, a woman, a child or a cow cannot be killed under any
circumstances. Vasudeva stressed that Devaki was not only a woman but a member of Kamsa s family. Because she
was now married to Vasudeva, she was para-stri, another man's wife, and if such a woman were killed, not only
would Kamsa be implicated in sinful activities, but his reputation as king of the Bhoja dynasty would be damaged.
Thus Vasudeva tried in many ways to convince Kamsa in order to stop him from killing Devaki.

O great hero, one who takes birth is sure to die, for death is born with the body. One may die today or after
hundreds of years, but death is sure for every living entity.
Vasudeva wanted to impress upon Kamsa that although Kamsa feared dying and therefore wanted to kill even a
woman, he could not avoid death. Death is sure. Why then should Kamsa do something that would be detrimental
to his reputation and that of his family? As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.27):
jatasya hi dhruvo mrtyur
dhruvam janma mrtasya ca
tasmad apariharye 'rthe
na tvam socitum arhasi
"For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain. Therefore, in the
unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament." One should not fear death. Rather, one should
prepare oneself for the next birth. One should utilize one's time in this human form to end the process of birth and
death. It is not that to save oneself from death one should entangle oneself in sinful activities. This is not good.

dehe--when the body; pancatvam apanne--turns into five elements; dehi--the proprietor of the body, the living
being; karma-anugah--following the reactions of his own fruitive activities; avasah--spontaneously, automatically;
deha-antaram--another body (made of material elements); anuprapya--receiving as a result; praktanam--the former;

When the present body turns to dust and is again reduced to five elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--the
proprietor of the body, the living being, automatically receives another body of material elements according to his
fruitive activities. When the next body is obtained, he gives up the present body.
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, which presents the beginning of spiritual understanding.
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly
passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." (Bg. 2.13) A person
or an animal is not the material body; rather, the material body is the covering of the living being. Bhagavad-gita
compares the body to a dress and elaborately explains how one changes dresses one after another. The same Vedic
knowledge is confirmed here. The living being, the soul, is constantly changing bodies one after another. Even in
the present life, the body changes from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youth, and from youth to old age;
similarly, when the body is too old to continue, the living being gives up this body and, by the laws of nature,
automatically gets another body according to his fruitive activities, desires and ambitions. The laws of nature
control this sequence, and therefore as long as the living entity is under the control of the external, material energy,
the process of bodily change takes place automatically, according to one's fruitive activities. Vasudeva therefore
wanted to impress upon Kamsa that if he committed this sinful act of killing a woman, in his next life he would
certainly get a material body still more conditioned to the sufferings of material existence. Thus Vasudeva advised
Kamsa not to commit sinful activities.
One who commits sinful activities because of ignorance, tamo-guna, obtains a lower body. Karanam guna-sango
'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). There are hundreds and thousands of different species of life. Why are
there higher and lower bodies? One receives these bodies according to the contaminations of material nature. If in
this life one is contaminated by the mode of ignorance and sinful activities (duskrti), in the next life, by the laws of
nature, one will certainly get a body full of suffering. The laws of nature are not subservient to the whimsical
desires of the conditioned soul. Our endeavor, therefore, should be to associate always with sattva-guna and not
indulge in rajo-guna or tamo-guna (rajas-tamo-bhavah). Lusty desires and greed keep the living entity perpetually
in ignorance and prevent him from being elevated to the platform of sattva-guna or suddha-sattva-guna. One is
advised to be situated in suddha-sattva-guna, devotional service, for thus one is immune to the reactions of the
three modes of material nature.

Just as a person traveling on the road rests one foot on the ground and then lifts the other, or as a worm on a
vegetable transfers itself to one leaf and then gives up the previous one, the conditioned soul takes shelter of
another body and then gives up the one he had before.
This is the process of the soul's transmigration from one body to another. At the time of death, according to his
mental condition, the living being is carried by the subtle body, consisting of mind, intelligence and ego, to another
gross body. When higher authorities have decided what kind of gross body the living entity will have, he is forced
to enter such a body, and thus he automatically gives up his previous body. Dull-minded persons who do not have
the intelligence to understand this process of transmigration take for granted that when the gross body is finished,
one's life is finished forever. Such persons have no brains with which to understand the process of transmigration.
At the present moment there is great opposition to the Hare Krsna movement, which is being called a
"brainwashing" movement. But actually the so-called scientists, philosophers and other leaders in the Western
countries have no brains at all. The Hare Krsna movement is trying to elevate such foolish persons by enlightening
their intelligence so that they will take advantage of the human body. Unfortunately, because of gross ignorance,
they regard the Hare Krsna movement as a brainwashing movement. They do not know that without God
consciousness one is forced to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Because of their devilish brains,
they will next be forced to accept an abominable life and practically never be able to liberate themselves from the
conditional life of material existence. How this transmigration of the soul takes place is very clearly explained in
this verse.

svapne--in a dream; yatha--as; pasyati--one sees; deham--the kind of body; idrsam--similarly; manorathena--by
mental speculation; abhinivista--is fully absorbed; cetanah--he whose consciousness; drsta--by whatever has been

speak of; hi--indeed; apasmrtih--experiencing forgetfulness of the present body.
Having experienced a situation by seeing or hearing about it, one contemplates and speculates about that
situation, and thus one surrenders to it, not considering his present body. Similarly, by mental adjustments one
dreams at night of living under different circumstances, in different bodies, and forgets his actual position. Under
this same process, one gives up his present body and accepts another [tatha dehantara-praptih].
Transmigration of the soul is very clearly explained in this verse. One sometimes forgets his present body and
thinks of his childhood body, a body of the past, and of how one was playing, jumping, talking and so on. When
the material body is no long workable, it becomes dust: "For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." But
when the body again mixes with the five material elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--the mind continues to
work. The mind is the subtle substance in which the body is created, as we actually experience in our dreams and
also when we are awake in contemplation. One must understand that the process of mental speculation develops a
new type of body that does not actually exist. If one can understand the nature of the mind (manorathena) and its
thinking, feeling and willing, one can very easily understand how from the mind different types of bodies develop.
The Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, offers a process of transcendental activities wherein the mind is
fully absorbed in affairs pertaining to Krsna. The presence of the soul is perceived by consciousness, and one must
purify his consciousness from material to spiritual, or, in other words, to Krsna consciousness. That which is
spiritual is eternal, and that which is material is temporary. Without Krsna consciousness, one's consciousness is
always absorbed in temporary things. For everyone, therefore, Krsna recommends in Bhagavad-gita (9.34), manmana
bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru. One should always be absorbed in thought of Krsna, one
should become His devotee, one should always engage in His service and worship Him as the supreme great, and
one should always offer Him obeisances. In the material world one is always a servant of a greater person, and in
the spiritual world our constitutional position is to serve the Supreme, the greatest, param brahma. This is the
instruction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa' (Cc. Madhya 20.108).
To act in Krsna consciousness is the perfection of life and the highest perfection of yoga. As Lord Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is
most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."
The condition of the mind, which flickers between sankalpa and vikalpa, accepting something and rejecting it, is
very important in transferring the soul to another material body at the time of death.
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail." (Bg. 8.6)
Therefore one must train the mind in the system of bhakti-yoga, as did Maharaja Ambarisa, who kept himself
always in Krsna consciousness. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. One must fix the mind at the lotus feet of
Krsna twenty-four hours a day. If the mind is fixed upon Krsna's lotus feet, the activities of the other senses will be
engaged in Krsna's service. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate: to serve Hrsikesa, the master of the senses,
with purified senses is called bhakti. Those who constantly engage in devotional service are situated in a
transcendental state, above the material modes of nature. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the
modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." One must learn the secret of success from the
Vedic literatures, especially when the cream of Vedic knowledge is presented by Bhagavad-gita as it is.
Because the mind is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the word apasmrtih is
significant. Forgetfulness of one's own identity is called apasmrtih. This apasmrtih can be controlled by the
Supreme Lord, for the Lord says, mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "From Me come remembrance, knowledge
and forgetfulness." Instead of allowing one to forget one's real position, Krsna can revive one's original identity at
the time of one's death, even though the mind may be flickering. Although the mind may work imperfectly at the
time of death, Krsna gives a devotee shelter at His lotus feet. Therefore when a devotee gives up his body, the mind
does not take him to another material body (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti); rather, Krsna takes the
devotee to that place where He is engaged in His pastimes (mam eti), as we have already discussed in previous
verses. One's consciousness, therefore, must always be absorbed in Krsna, and then one's life will be successful.
Otherwise the mind will carry the soul to another material body. The soul will be placed in the semen of a father
and discharged into the womb of a mother. The semen and ovum create a particular type of body according to the
form of the father and mother, and when the body is mature, the soul emerges in that body and begins a new life.
This is the process of transmigration of the soul from one body to another (tatha dehantara-praptih).
Unfortunately, those who are less intelligent think that when the body disappears, everything is finished. The
entire world is being misled by such fools and rascals. But as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.20), na hanyate hanyamane
sarire. The soul does not die when the body is destroyed. Rather, the soul takes on another body.

yatah yatah--from one place to another or from one position to another; dhavati--speculates; daiva-coditam--
impelled by accident or deliberation; manah--the mind; vikara-atmakam--changing from one type of thinking,
feeling and willing to another; apa--at the end, he obtains (a mentality); pancasu--at the time of death (when the

body; asau--he; prapadyamanah--being surrendered (to such a condition); saha--with; tena--a similar body; jayate--
takes birth.
At the time of death, according to the thinking, feeling and willing of the mind, which is involved in fruitive
activities, one receives a particular body. In other words, the body develops according to the activities of the mind.
Changes of body are due to the flickering of the mind, for otherwise the soul could remain in its original, spiritual
body.
One can very easily understand that the mind is constantly flickering, changing in the quality of its thinking,
feeling and willing. This is explained by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (6.34):
cancalam hi manah krsna
pramathi balavad drdham
tasyaham nigraham manye
vayor iva suduskaram
The mind is cancala, flickering, and it changes very strongly. Therefore Arjuna admitted that controlling the
mind is not at all possible; this would be as difficult as controlling the wind. For example, if one were in a boat
moving according to the wind on a river or the sea, and the wind were uncontrollable, the tilting boat would be
very much disturbed and extremely difficult to control. It might even capsize. Therefore, in the bhava-samudra, the
ocean of mental speculation and transmigration to different types of bodies, one must first control the mind.
By regulative practice one can control the mind, and this is the purpose of the yoga system (abhyasa-yogayuktena).
But there is a chance of failure with the yoga system, especially in this age of Kali, because the yoga
system uses artificial means. If the mind is engaged in bhakti-yoga, however, by the grace of Krsna one can very
easily control it. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva
kevalam. One should chant the holy name of the Lord constantly, for the holy name of the Lord is nondifferent
from Hari, the Supreme Person.
By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra constantly, one can fix the mind on the lotus feet of Krsna (sa vai manah
krsna-padaravindayoh) and in this way achieve the perfection of yoga. Otherwise, the flickering mind will hover on
the platform of mental speculation for sense enjoyment, and one will have to transmigrate from one type of body to
another because the mind is trained only in relation to the material elements, or, in other words, to sense
gratification, which is false. Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag. 7.9.43). Rascals (vimudhan), being
controlled by mental speculation, make huge arrangements by which to enjoy life temporarily, but they must give
up the body at the time of death, when everything is taken away by Krsna's external energy (mrtyuh sarva-haras
caham). At that time, whatever one has created in this life is lost, and one must automatically accept a new body by
the force of material nature. In this life one may have constructed a very tall skyscraper, but in the next life,
because of one's mentality, one may have to accept a body like that of a cat, a dog, a tree or perhaps a demigod.
Thus the body is offered by the laws of material nature. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu (Bg.
13.22). The spirit soul takes birth in higher and lower species of life only because of his association with the three
qualities of material nature.
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion
live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds." (Bg. 14.18)
In conclusion, the Krsna consciousness movement offers the topmost welfare activity for human society. The
saner section of human society must therefore take this movement very seriously for the benefit of all humanity. To
save oneself from the repetition of birth and death, one must purify his consciousness. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must be freed from all designations--"I am American," "I am Indian," "I am this," "I
am that"--and come to the platform of understanding that Krsna is the original master and we are His eternal
servants. When the senses are purified and engaged in Krsna's service, one achieves the highest perfection.
Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. The Krsna consciousness movement is a movement of bhakti-yoga.
Vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga. By following the principles of this movement, one becomes disassociated from
material mental concoctions and is established on the original platform of the eternal relationship between the
living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead as servant and master. This, in summary, is the purpose of
the Krsna consciousness movement.

world, manifested by the modes of nature; raga-anugatah--according to his attachment; vimuhyati--becomes
bewildered by identification.
When the luminaries in the sky, such as the moon, the sun and the stars, are reflected in liquids like oil or water,
they appear to be of different shapes--sometimes round, sometimes long, and so on--because of the movements of
the wind. Similarly, when the living entity, the soul, is absorbed in materialistic thoughts, he accepts various
manifestations as his own identity because of ignorance. In other words, one is bewildered by mental concoctions
because of agitation from the material modes of nature.
This verse gives a very good example by which to understand the different positions of the eternal spiritual soul
in the material world and how the soul takes on different bodies (dehantara-praptih). The moon is stationary and is
one, but when it is reflected in water or oil, it appears to take different shapes because of the movements of the
wind. Similarly, the soul is the eternal servant of Krsna, the Supreme personality of Godhead, but when put into
the material modes of nature, it takes different bodies, sometimes as a demigod, sometimes a man, a dog, a tree and
so on. By the influence of maya, the illusory potency of the Supreme personality of Godhead, the living entity
thinks that he is this person, that person, American, Indian, cat, dog, tree or whatever. This is called maya. When
one is freed from this bewilderment and understands that the soul does not belong to any shape of this material
world, one is situated on the spiritual platform (brahma-bhuta).
This realization is sometimes explained as nirakara, or formlessness. This formlessness, however, does not mean
that the soul has no form. The soul has form, but the external, agitating form he has acquired because of material
contamination is false. Similarly, God is also described as nirakara, which means that God has no material form but
is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. The living entity is part and parcel of the supreme sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, but his
material forms are temporary, or illusory. Both the living entity and the Supreme Lord have original, spiritual forms
(sac-cid-ananda-vigraha), but the Lord, the Supreme, does not change His form. The Lord appears as He is,
whereas the living entity appears because material nature forces him to accept different forms. When the living
entity receives these different forms, he identifies with them, and not with his original, spiritual form. As soon as
the living entity returns to his original, spiritual form and understanding, he immediately surrenders to the
supreme form, the Personality of Godhead. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.19). Bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate. When the living entity, after many, many births in different forms, returns to his
original form of Krsna consciousness, he immediately surrenders unto the lotus feet of the supreme form, Krsna.
This is liberation. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He
never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains
pure devotional service unto Me." Surrender unto the supreme form is the result of bhakti. This bhakti, or
understanding of one's own position, is the complete liberation. As long as one is under an impersonal
understanding of the Absolute Truth, he is not in pure knowledge, but must still struggle for pure knowledge.
Kleso 'dhikataras tesam avyaktasakta-cetasam (Bg. 12.5). Although one may be spiritually advanced, if one is
attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth one must still work very hard, as indicated by the words
kleso 'dhikatarah, which mean "greater suffering." A devotee, however, easily attains his original position as a
spiritual form and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form.
Krsna Himself explains the forms of the living entities in the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, where He clearly
says to Arjuna that He, Arjuna and all other living entities, who were previously in their original forms, are separate
individual identities. They were individuals in the past, they are now situated in individuality, and in the future
they will all continue to maintain their individual forms. The only difference is that the conditioned living entity
appears in various material forms, whereas Krsna appears in His original, spiritual form. Unfortunately, those who
are not advanced in spiritual knowledge think that Krsna is like one of them and that His form is like their material
forms. Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg. 9.11). Krsna is never puffed up by material knowledge
and is therefore called acyuta, whereas the living entities fall down and are agitated by material nature. This is the
difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entities.
In this connection it is to be noted that Vasudeva, who was situated in a transcendental position, advised Kamsa
not to commit further sinful activities. Kamsa, a representative of the demons, was always ready to kill Krsna, or
God, whereas Vasudeva represents a transcendentally situated person to whom Krsna is born (Vasudeva is the son
of Vasudeva). Vasudeva wanted his brother-in-law Kamsa to refrain from the sinful act of killing his sister, since
the result of being agitated by material nature would be that Kamsa would have to accept a body in which to suffer
again and again. Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.4), Rsabhadeva also says:
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
As long as the living entity is entangled in the fruitive activities of so-called happiness and distress, he will receive
a particular type of body in which to endure the three kinds of suffering due to material nature (tri-tapa-yantrana).
An intelligent person, therefore, must free himself from the influence of the three modes of material nature and
revive his original, spiritual body by engaging in the service of the Supreme Person, Krsna. As long as one is
materially attached, one must accept the process of birth, death, old age and disease. One is therefore advised that
an intelligent person, instead of being entangled in so-called good and bad fruitive activities, should engage his life
in advancing in Krsna consciousness so that instead of accepting another material body (tyaktva deham punar
janma naiti), he will return home, back to Godhead.

Instead of being inimical toward other living entities, one should act piously by engaging in the service of the
Supreme Lord, thus avoiding a fearful situation both in this life and in the next. In this regard, the following moral
instruction by the great politician Canakya Pandita is very meaningful:
tyaja durjana-samsargam
bhaja sadhu-samagamam
kuru punyam aho ratram
smara nityam anityatam
One should give up the company of devils, demons and nondevotees and should always associate with devotees
and saintly persons. One should always act piously, thinking that this life is temporary, and not be attached to
temporary happiness and distress. The Krsna consciousness movement is teaching all of human society this
principle of becoming Krsna conscious and thus solving the problems of life forever (tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna).

of the Raksasas. Therefore he could be neither pacified nor terrified by the good instructions given by Vasudeva. He
did not care about the results of sinful activities, either in this life or in the next.

When Vasudeva saw that Kamsa was determined to kill his sister Devaki, he thought to himself very deeply.
Considering the imminent danger of death, he thought of another plan to stop Kamsa.
Although Vasudeva saw the imminent danger that his wife Devaki would be killed, he was convinced of his
welfare because at his birth the demigods had played drums and kettledrums. He therefore attempted another way
to save Devaki.

As long as he has intelligence and bodily strength, an intelligent person must try to avoid death. This is the duty
of every embodied person. But if death cannot be avoided in spite of one's endeavors, a person facing death
commits no offense.
It is natural for a person facing untimely death to try his best to save himself. This is one's duty. Although death
is sure, everyone should try to avoid it and not meet death without opposition because every living soul is by
nature eternal. Because death is a punishment imposed in the condemned life of material existence, the Vedic
culture is based on avoiding death (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti). Everyone should try to avoid death and
rebirth by cultivating spiritual life and should not submit to death without struggling to survive. One who is not
trying to stop death is not an intelligent human being. Because Devaki was face to face with imminent death, it was
Vasudeva's duty to save her, as he was trying his best to do. He therefore considered another way to approach
Kamsa so that Devaki would be saved.

Vasudeva considered: By delivering all my sons to Kamsa, who is death personified, I shall save the life of Devaki.
Perhaps Kamsa will die before my sons take birth, or, since he is already destined to die at the hands of my son,
one of my sons may kill him. For the time being, let me promise to hand over my sons so that Kamsa will give up
this immediate threat, and if in due course of time Kamsa dies, I shall have nothing to fear.
Vasudeva wanted to save the life of Devaki by promising to deliver his sons to Kamsa. "In the future," he
thought, "Kamsa may die, or I may not beget any sons. Even if a son is born and I deliver him to Kamsa, Kamsa
may die at his hands, for by providence anything could happen. It is very difficult to understand how things are
managed by providence." Thus Vasudeva decided that he would promise to deliver his sons to the hands of Kamsa
in order to save Devaki from the imminent danger of death.

Similarly, when a living being accepts one kind of body and leaves aside another, there is no other reason than
unseen destiny.
When there is a fire in a village, the fire sometimes jumps over one house and burns another. Similarly, when
there is a forest fire, the fire sometimes jumps over one tree and catches another. Why this happens, no one can
say. One may set forth some imaginary reason why the nearest tree or house did not catch fire whereas a tree or
house in a distant place did, but actually the reason is destiny. This reason also applies to the transmigration of the
soul, by which a prime minister in one life may become a dog in the next. The work of unseen destiny cannot be
ascertained by practical experimental knowledge, and therefore one must be satisfied by reasoning that everything
is done by supreme providence.

sorrow; vihasan--smiling externally; idam abravit--and spoke as follows.
Vasudeva's mind was full of anxiety because his wife was facing danger, but in order to please the cruel,
shameless and sinful Kamsa, he externally smiled and spoke to him as follows.
Sometimes one must act duplicitously in a dangerous position, as Vasudeva did to save his wife. The material
world is complicated, and to execute one's duties, one cannot avoid adopting such diplomacy. Vasudeva did
everything possible to save his wife for the sake of begetting Krsna. This indicates that one may act duplicitously
for the purpose of saving Krsna and His interests. According to the arrangement already foretold, Krsna was to
appear through Vasudeva and Devaki to kill Kamsa. Vasudeva, therefore, had to do everything to save the situation.
Although all the events were prearranged by Krsna, a devotee must try his best to serve the purpose of Krsna. Krsna
Himself is all-powerful, but it is not that a devotee should therefore sit idly and leave everything to Him. This
instruction is also found in Bhagavad-gita. Although Krsna was doing everything for Arjuna, Arjuna never sat down
idly as a nonviolent gentleman. Rather, he tried his best to fight the battle and be victorious.

the sons from whom your fear has arisen, I shall deliver them all unto your hands.
Kamsa feared Devaki's existence because after her eighth pregnancy she would give birth to a son who would kill
him. Vasudeva, therefore, to assure his brother-in-law the utmost safety, promised to bring him all the sons. He
would not wait for the eighth son, but from the very beginning would deliver to the hands of Kamsa all the sons to
which Devaki would give birth. This was the most liberal proposition offered by Vasudeva to Kamsa.

Although Kamsa was a sinful demon, he believed that Vasudeva would never deviate from his word. The
character of a pure devotee like Vasudeva is such that even so great a demon as Kamsa firmly believed in his words
and was satisfied. Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah (Bhag. 5.18.12). All good
attributes are present in a devotee, so much so that even Kamsa believed in Vasudeva's words without a doubt.

Each year thereafter, in due course of time, Devaki, the mother of God and all the demigods, gave birth to a child.
Thus she bore eight sons, one after another, and a daughter named Subhadra.
The spiritual master is sometimes glorified as sarva-devamayo guruh (Bhag. 11.7.27). By the grace of the guru,
the spiritual master, one can understand the different kinds of devas. The word deva refers to God, the Supreme
personality of Godhead, who is the original source of all the demigods, who are also called devas. In Bhagavad-gita
(10.2) the Lord says, aham adir hi devanam: "I am the source of all the devas." The Supreme Lord, Visnu, the
Original person, expands in different forms. Tad aiksata bahu syam (Chandogya Upanisad 6.2.3). He alone has
expanded into many. Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam (Brahma-samhita 5.33). There are different grades
of forms, known as svamsa and vibhinnamsa. The svamsa expansions, or visnu-tattva, are the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, whereas the vibhinnamsa are jiva-tattva, who are part and parcel of the Lord (mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah). If we accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him, all the parts
and expansions of the Lord are automatically worshiped. Sarvarhanam acyutejya (Bhag. 4.31.14). Krsna is known
as Acyuta (senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta). By worshiping Acyuta, Krsna, one automatically
worships all the demigods. There is no need of separately worshiping either the visnu-tattva or jiva-tattva. If one
concentrates upon Krsna, one worships everyone. Therefore, because mother Devaki gave birth to Krsna, she is
described here as sarva-devata.

Vasudeva was very much disturbed by fear of becoming a liar by breaking his promise. Thus with great pain he

In the Vedic system, as soon as a child is born, especially a male child, the father calls for learned brahmanas, and
according to the description of the child's horoscope, the child is immediately given a name. This ceremony is
called nama-karana. There are ten different samskaras, or reformatory methods, adopted in the system of
varnasrama-dharma, and the name-giving ceremony is one of them. Although Vasudeva's first son was to be
delivered into the hands of Kamsa, the nama-karana ceremony was performed, and thus the child was named
Kirtiman. Such names are given immediately after birth.

lotus feet?
Since the eighth son of Devaki was to kill Kamsa, one might ask what the need was for Vasudeva to deliver the
first-born child. The answer is that Vasudeva had promised Kamsa that he would deliver all the children born of
Devaki. Kamsa, being an asura, did not believe that the eighth child would kill him; he took it for granted that he
might be killed by any of the children of Devaki. Vasudeva, therefore, to save Devaki, promised to give Kamsa
every child, whether male or female. From another point of view, Vasudeva and Devaki were very pleased when
they understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, would come as their eighth son. Vasudeva, a
pure devotee of the Lord, was eager to see Krsna appear as his child from the eighth pregnancy of Devaki.
Therefore he wanted to deliver all the children quickly so that the eighth turn would come and Krsna would
appear. He begot one child every year so that Krsna's turn to appear would come as soon as possible.

My dear King Pariksit, when Kamsa saw that Vasudeva, being situated in truthfulness, was completely equipoised
in giving him the child, he was very happy. Therefore, with a smiling face, he spoke as follows.
The word samatvam is very significant in this verse. Samatvam refers to one who is always equipoised, unaffected
by either happiness or distress. Vasudeva was so steadily equipoised that he did not seem in the least agitated when
delivering his first-born child into the hands of Kamsa to be killed. In Bhagavad-gita (2.56) it is said, duhkhesv
anudvigna-manah sukhesu vigata-sprhah. In the material world, one should not be very eager to be happy, nor
should one be very much disturbed by material distress. Lord Krsna advised Arjuna:
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course,
are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O
scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." (Bg. 2.14) The self-realized soul is
never disturbed by so-called distress or happiness, and this is especially true of an exalted devotee like Vasudeva,
who showed this by his practical example. Vasudeva was not at all disturbed when delivering his first child to
Kamsa to be killed.

The inhabitants of Vrndavana, headed by Nanda Maharaja and including his associate cowherd men and their
wives, were none but denizens of the heavenly planets, O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the descendants of Bharata, and
so too were the descendants of the Vrsni dynasty, headed by Vasudeva, and Devaki and the other women of the
dynasty of Yadu. The friends, relatives and well-wishers of both Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva and even those who
externally appeared to be followers of Kamsa were all demigods.
As previously discussed, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, informed Lord Brahma that Lord Krsna
would personally descend to mitigate the suffering on the earth. The Lord ordered all the denizens of the heavenly
planets to take birth in different families of the Yadu and Vrsni dynasties and in Vrndavana. Now this verse informs
us that all the family and friends of the Yadu dynasty, the Vrsni dynasty, Nanda Maharaja and the gopas descended
from the heavenly planets to see the pastimes of the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), the Lord's pastimes
consist of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam--saving the devotees and killing the demons. To
demonstrate these activities, the Lord called for devotees from different parts of the universe.
There are many devotees who are elevated to the higher planetary systems.
prapya punya-krtam lokan
usitva sasvatih samah
sucinam srimatam gehe
yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate
"The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born
into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy." (Bg. 6.41) Some devotees, having failed to
complete the process of devotional service, are promoted to the heavenly planets, to which the pious are elevated,
and after enjoying there they may be directly promoted to the place where the Lord's pastimes are going on. When
Lord Krsna was to appear, the denizens of the heavenly planets were invited to see the pastimes of the Lord, and
thus it is stated here that the members of the Yadu and Vrsni dynasties and the inhabitants of Vrndavana were
demigods or almost as good as demigods. Even those who externally helped the activities of Kamsa belonged to the
higher planetary systems. The imprisonment and release of Vasudeva and the killing of various demons were all
manifestations of the pastimes of the Lord, and because the devotees would be pleased to see these activities
personally, they were all invited to take birth as friends and relatives of these families. As confirmed in the prayers
of Kunti (Bhag. 1.8.19), nato natya-dharo yatha. The Lord was to play the part of a demon-killer, and a friend, son
and brother to His devotees, and thus these devotees were all summoned.

Once the great saint Narada approached Kamsa and informed him of how the demoniac persons who were a great
burden on the earth were going to be killed. Thus Kamsa was placed into great fear and doubt.
It has already been discussed that mother earth implored Lord Brahma to give her relief from the distress created
by the burdensome demons and that Lord Brahma informed her that Lord Krsna Himself was going to appear.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
Whenever there is a burden created by the demons and whenever the innocent devotees are distressed by
demoniac rulers, the Lord appears in due course of time to kill the demons with the assistance of His real
representatives, who are technically called demigods. In the Upanisads it is stated that the demigods are different
parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is the duty of the parts of the body to serve the whole, it is the
duty of Krsna's devotees to serve Krsna as He wants. Krsna's business is to kill the demons, and therefore this
should be a devotee's business also. Because the people of Kali-yuga are fallen, however, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
out of kindness for them, did not bring any weapon to kill them. Rather, by spreading Krsna consciousness, love of
Krsna, He wanted to kill their nefarious, demoniac activities. This is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness
movement. Unless the demoniac activities on the surface of the world are diminished or vanquished, no one can be
happy. The program for the conditioned soul is fully described in Bhagavad-gita, and one simply has to follow
these instructions to become happy. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore prescribed:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
Let people chant the Hare Krsna mantra constantly. Then their demoniac tendencies will be killed, and they will
become first-class devotees, happy in this life and in the next.

another; ahan--killed; putram--the sons; tayoh--of Vasudeva and Devaki; ajana-sankaya--with the doubt that they

After the departure of the great saint Narada, Kamsa thought that all the members of the Yadu dynasty were
demigods and that any of the children born from the womb of Devaki might be Visnu. Fearing his death, Kamsa
arrested Vasudeva and Devaki and chained them with iron shackles. Suspecting each of the children to be Visnu,
Kamsa killed them one after another because of the prophecy that Visnu would kill him.
Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his notes on this verse, has mentioned how Narada Muni gave Kamsa this information.
This incident is described in the Hari-vamsa. Narada Muni went to see Kamsa by providence, and Kamsa received
him very well. Narada, therefore, informed him that any one of the sons of Devaki might be Visnu. Because Visnu
was to kill him, Kamsa should not spare any of Devaki's children, Narada Muni advised. Narada's intention was
that Kamsa, by killing the children, would increase his sinful activities so that Krsna would soon appear to kill him.
Upon receiving the instructions of Narada Muni, Kamsa killed all the children of Devaki one after another.
The word ajana-sankaya indicates that Lord Visnu never takes birth (ajana) and that He therefore appeared as
Krsna, taking birth just like a human being (manusim tanum asritam). Kamsa attempted to kill all the babies born
of Devaki and Vasudeva, although he knew that if Visnu were born, He would not be killed. Actually it came to
pass that when Visnu appeared as Krsna, Kamsa could not kill Him; rather, as foretold, it was He who killed
Kamsa. One should know in truth how Krsna, who takes His birth transcendentally, acts to kill the demons but is
never killed. When one perfectly understands Krsna in this way, through the medium of sastra, one becomes
immortal. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body,
take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."

Kings greedy for sense gratification on this earth almost always kill their enemies indiscriminately. To satisfy
their own whims, they may kill anyone, even their mothers, fathers, brothers or friends.
We have seen in the history of India that Aurangzeb killed his brother and nephews and imprisoned his father to
fulfill political ambitions. There have been many similar instances, and Kamsa was the same type of king. Kamsa
did not hesitate to kill his nephews and imprison his sister and his father. For demons to do such things is not
astonishing. Nonetheless, although Kamsa was a demon, he was aware that Lord Visnu cannot be killed, and thus
he attained salvation. Even partial understanding of the activities of Lord Visnu makes one eligible for salvation.
Kamsa knew a little about Krsna--that He could not be killed--and therefore he attained salvation although he
thought of Visnu, Krsna, as an enemy. What then is to be said of one who knows Krsna perfectly from the
descriptions of sastras like Bhagavad-gita? It is therefore the duty of everyone to read Bhagavad-gita and
understand Krsna perfectly. This will make one's life successful.

ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR THIS CHAPTER
Regarding transmigration of the soul, Srila Madhvacarya gives the following notes. When one is awake, whatever
one sees or hears is impressed upon the mind, which later works in dreams to show one different experiences,
although in dreams one appears to accept a different body. For example, when one is awake one does business and
talks with customers, and similarly in dreams one meets various customers, talks about business and gives
quotations. Madhvacarya says, therefore, that dreams take place according to what one sees, hears and remembers.
When one reawakens, of course, one forgets the body of the dream. This forgetfulness is called apasmrti. Thus we
are changing bodies because we are sometimes dreaming, sometimes awake and sometimes forgetful. Forgetfulness
of our previously created body is called death, and our work in the present body is called life. After death, one
cannot remember the activities of one's previous body, whether imaginary or factual.
The agitated mind is compared to agitated water reflecting the sun and the moon. Actually the sun and moon
reflected on the water do not exist there; nonetheless, they are reflected according to the movements of the water.
Similarly, when our minds are agitated, we wander in different material atmospheres and receive different types of
bodies. This is described in Bhagavad-gita as guna-sanga. Karanam guna-sango 'sya. Madhvacarya says, gunanubaddhah
san. And Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva (Cc. Madhya
19.151). The living entity rotates up and down throughout the universe, sometimes in the upper planetary system,
sometimes in the middle and lower planetary systems, sometimes as a man, sometimes a god, a dog, a tree and so
on. This is all due to the agitation of the mind. The mind must therefore be steadily fixed. As it is said, sa vai
manah krsna-padaravindayoh. One should fix one's mind at the lotus feet of Krsna, and then one will become free
from agitation. This is the instruction of the Garuda Purana, and in the Naradiya purana the same process is
described. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, yanti deva-vrata devan. The agitated mind goes to different planetary systems
because it is attached to different kinds of demigods, but one does not go to the abode of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead by worshiping the demigods, for this is not supported by any Vedic literature. Man is the architect of
his own fortune. In this human life one has the facility with which to understand one's real situation, and one can
decide whether to wander around the universe forever or return home, back to Godhead. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).
There is no such thing as chance. When a tree is burning in a forest fire and although the nearest tree is spared a
distant tree catches fire, this may appear to be chance. Similarly, one may seem to get different types of bodies by
chance, but actually one receives these bodies because of the mind. The mind flickers between accepting and
rejecting, and according to the acceptance and rejection of the mind, we receive different types of bodies, although
we superficially seem to obtain these bodies by chance. Even if we accept the theory of chance, the immediate
cause for the change of body is the agitation of the mind.
Notes on amsa. This chapter describes that Krsna appeared amsena, with His parts and parcels or His partial
manifestation. In this connection, Sridhara Svami says that Krsna is one hundred percent Bhagavan (krsnas tu
bhagavan svayam). Because of our imperfections, however, we cannot appreciate Krsna in fullness, and therefore
whatever Krsna exhibited when present on earth was but a partial manifestation of His opulence. Again, Krsna
appeared with His plenary expansion Baladeva. Krsna, however, is full; there is no question of His appearing
partially. In the Vaisnava-tosani, Srila Sanatana Gosvami says that to accept that Krsna was partially manifested
would contradict the statement krsnas tu bhagavan svayam. Srila Jiva Gosvami says that the word amsena means
that Krsna appeared with all His plenary expansions. The words amsena visnoh do not mean that Krsna is a partial
representative of Visnu. Rather, Krsna appeared in fullness, and He manifests Himself partially in the
Vaikunthalokas. In other words, Lord Visnu is a partial representation of Krsna; Krsna is not a partial
representation of Visnu. In the Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila, Chapter Four, this subject matter is explained very
clearly. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also notes that no one can describe Krsna in fullness. Whatever
descriptions we find in Srimad-Bhagavatam are partial explanations of Krsna. In conclusion, therefore, the word
amsena indicates that Lord Visnu is a partial representation of Krsna, not that Krsna is a partial representation of
Visnu.
Srila Sanatana Gosvami's Vaisnava-tosani has explained the word dharma-silasya. The exact meaning of dharmasila
is "an unadulterated devotee." Real dharma consists of full surrender to Krsna (sarva-dharman parityajya mam
ekam saranam vraja). One who has fully surrendered to Krsna is actually religious. One such religious person was
Maharaja Pariksit. Anyone who accepts the principle of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, giving up all other
systems of religion, is actually dharma-sila, perfectly religious.
The word nivrtta-tarsaih refers to one who no longer has any material desires (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam). One
may have many material desires because of contamination in this material world, but when one is completely free
from all material desires, he is called nivrtta-trsna, which indicates that he no longer has any thirst for material
enjoyment. Svamin krtartho 'smi varam na yace (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya). Materialistic persons want some material
profit from executing devotional service, but this is not the purpose of service. The perfection of devotional service
lies in complete surrender unto the lotus feet of Krsna, with no material desires. One who surrenders in this way is
already liberated. Jivan-muktah sa ucyate. One who is always busy serving Krsna, in whatever condition he may
live, is understood to be liberated even in this life. Such a person, who is a pure devotee, does not need to change
his body; indeed, he does not possess a material body, for his body has already been spiritualized. An iron rod kept
constantly within a fire will ultimately become fire, and whatever it touches will burn. Similarly, the pure devotee
is in the fire of spiritual existence, and therefore his body is cin-maya; that is, it is spiritual, not material, because
the pure devotee has no desire but the transcendental desire to serve the Lord. In text four the word upagiyamanat
is used: nivrtta-tarsair upagiyamanat. Who will chant the glories of the Lord unless he is a devotee? Therefore the
word nivrtta-tarsaih indicates the devotee, and no one else. These are the remarks of acaryas like Viraraghava
Acarya and Vijayadhvaja. To desire anything other than devotional service will diminish one's freedom from
material desires, but when one is free from all such desires one is called nivrtta-tarsaih.
Vina pasu-ghnat. The word pasu means "animal." An animal killer, pasu-ghna, cannot enter into Krsna
consciousness. In our Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, animal killing is completely prohibited.
Uttamasloka-gunanuvadat. The word uttamasloka means "one who is famous as the best of those who are good."
The Lord is good in all circumstances. That is His natural reputation. His goodness is unlimited, and He uses it
unlimitedly. A devotee is also sometimes described as uttamasloka, meaning that he is eager to glorify the Supreme
Personality of Godhead or the Lord's devotees. Glorifying the Lord and glorifying the Lord's devotees are the same.
Or, rather, glorifying the devotee is more important than glorifying the Lord directly. Narottama dasa Thakura
explains this fact: chadiya vaisnava-seva, nistara payeche keba. One cannot be liberated from material
contamination without sincerely serving a devotee of Krsna.
Bhavausadhat means "from the universal remedy." Chanting the holy name and glorifying the Supreme Lord are
the universal remedy for all the miseries of materialistic life. Persons who desire to be freed from this material
world are called mumuksu. Such persons can understand the miseries of materialistic life, and by glorifying the
activities of the Lord they can be released from all these miseries. The transcendental sound vibrations concerning
the Lord's name, fame, form, qualities and paraphernalia are all nondifferent from the Lord. Therefore the very
sound vibration of the Lord's glorification and name are pleasing to the ears, and by understanding the absolute
nature of the Lord's name, form and qualities the devotee becomes joyful. Even those who are not devotees,
however, enjoy the pleasing narrations of the Lord's transcendental activities. Even ordinary persons not very much
advanced in Krsna consciousness take pleasure in describing the narrations depicted in Srimad-Bhagavatam. When
a materialistic person is purified in this way, he engages in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. Because
glorification of the Lord's pastimes is very pleasing to the ear and heart of the devotee, it is simultaneously his
subject and object.
In this world there are three kinds of men: those who are liberated, those trying to be liberated, and those
entangled in sense enjoyment. Of these three, those who are already liberated chant and hear the holy name of the
Lord, knowing perfectly that to glorify the Lord is the only way to keep oneself in a transcendental position. Those
who are trying to be liberated, the second class, may regard the chanting and hearing of the Lord's holy name as a
process of liberation, and they too will feel the transcendental pleasure of this chanting. As for karmis and persons
engaged in sense gratification, they also may take pleasure in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, like His fighting on
the Battlefield of Kuruksetra and His dancing in Vrndavana with the gopis.
The word uttamasloka-gunanuvada refers to the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord, such as His
affection for mother Yasoda and His friends the cowherd boys and His loving attitude toward the gopis. The Lord's
devotees like Maharaja Yudhisthira are also described by the qualification uttamasloka-gunanuvada. The word
anuvada refers to describing the qualities of the Supreme Lord or His devotees. When these qualities are described,
other devotees are interested in hearing them. The more one is interested in hearing about these transcendental
qualities, the more one transcendentally enjoys. Everyone, therefore, including the mumuksus, the vimuktas and
the karmis, should chant and hear the glories of the Lord, and in this way everyone will benefit.
Although the sound vibration of the transcendental qualities of the Lord is equally beneficial to all, for those who
are muktas, liberated, it is especially pleasing. As described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Eighth Canto, Third Chapter,
verse twenty, because pure devotees, who no longer have any material desires, surrender fully to the lotus feet of
the Lord, they always merge in the ocean of bliss by chanting and hearing the Lord's holy name. According to this
verse, devotees like Narada and other residents of Svetadvipa are seen always engaged in chanting the holy name of
the Lord because by such chanting they are always externally and internally blissful. The mumuksus, persons
desiring to be liberated, do not depend on the pleasures of the senses; instead, they concentrate fully on becoming
liberated by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Karmis like to create something pleasing to their ears and hearts,
and although they sometimes like to chant or hear the glories of the Lord, they do not do it openly. Devotees,
however, always spontaneously hear, chant about and remember the activities of the Lord, and by this process they
are fully satisfied, even though these may seem like topics of sense gratification. Simply by hearing the
transcendental narrations of the Lord's activities, Pariksit Maharaja was liberated. He was therefore
srotramano-'bhirama; that is, he glorified the process of hearing. This process should be accepted by all living
entities.
To distinguish persons who are bereft of these transcendental pleasures, Pariksit Maharaja has used the words
virajyeta puman. The word puman refers to any person, whether man, woman or in-between. Because of the bodily
conception of life, we are subject to lamentation, but one who has no such bodily conceptions can take pleasure in
transcendental hearing and chanting. Therefore a person fully absorbed in the bodily concept of life is surely killing
himself by not making spiritual progress. Such a person is called pasu-ghna. Especially excluded from spiritual life
are the animal hunters, who are not interested in hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such hunters are
always unhappy, both in this life and in the next. It is therefore said that a hunter should neither die nor live
because for such persons both living and dying are troublesome. Animal hunters are completely different from
ordinary karmis, and thus they have been excluded from the process of hearing and chanting. Vina pasu-ghnat.
They cannot enter into the transcendental pleasure of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord.
The word maha-ratha refers to a great hero who can fight alone against eleven thousand other heroes, and the
word atiratha, as found in text five, refers to one who can fight against an unlimited number. This is mentioned in
the Mahabharata as follows:
ekadasa-sahasrani
yodhayed yas tu dhanvinam
astra-sastra-pravinas ca
maha-ratha iti smrtah
amitan yodhayed yas tu
samprokto 'tirathas tu sah
This is the description given in the Brhad-vaisnava-tosani by Srila Sanatana Gosvami.
Maya-manusyasya (10.1.17). Because of being covered by yogamaya (naham prakasah sarvasya yogamayasamavrtah),
Krsna is sometimes called maya-manusya, indicating that although He is the Supreme personality of
Godhead, He appears like an ordinary person. A misunderstanding arises because yogamaya covers the vision of
the general public. The Lord's position is actually different from that of an ordinary person, for although He
appears to act like an ordinary man, He is always transcendental. The word maya also indicates "mercy," and
sometimes it also means "knowledge." The Lord is always full of all transcendental knowledge, and therefore
although He acts like a human being, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, full of knowledge. In His original
identity, the Lord is the controller of maya (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram). Therefore the Lord may
be called maya-manusya, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing like an ordinary human being, although
He is the controller of both the material and spiritual energies. The Lord is the Supreme Person, Purusottama, but
because we are deluded by yogamaya, He appears to be an ordinary person. Ultimately, however, yogamaya induces
even a nondevotee to understand the Lord as the Supreme Person, Purusottama. In Bhagavad-gita we find two
statements given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the devotees, the Lord says:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can
come to Me." (Bg. 10.10) Thus for the willing devotee the Lord gives intelligence by which to understand Him and
return home, back to Godhead. For others, for nondevotees, the Lord says, mrtyuh sarva-haras caham: "I am allplundering,
inevitable death." A devotee like Prahlada enjoys the activities of Lord Nrsimhadeva, whereas
nondevotees like Prahlada's father, Hiranyakasipu, meet death before Lord Nrsimhadeva. The Lord therefore acts in
two ways, by sending some onto the path of repeated birth and death and sending others back home, back to
Godhead.
The word kala, meaning "black," indicates the color of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Lord Krsna
and Lord Ramacandra, who both look blackish, give liberation and transcendental bliss to Their devotees. Among
persons possessing material bodies, sometimes someone is able to subject death to his own will. For such a person,
death is almost impossible because no one wants to die. But although Bhismadeva possessed this power, Bhisma, by
the supreme will of the Lord, died very easily in the Lord's presence. There have also been many demons who had
no hope of salvation, yet Kamsa attained salvation by the supreme will of the Lord. Not to speak of Kamsa, even
Putana attained salvation and reached the level of the Lord's mother. Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, was very eager to
hear about the Lord, who has inconceivable qualities by which to give liberation to anyone. Pariksit Maharaja, at
the point of his death, was certainly interested in his liberation. When such a great and exalted personality as the
Lord behaves like an ordinary human being although possessing inconceivable qualities, His behavior is called
maya. Therefore the Lord is described as maya-manusya. This is the opinion of Srila Jiva Gosvami. Mu refers to
mukti, or salvation, and ku refers to that which is bad or very obnoxious. Thus muku refers to the Supreme
personality of Godhead, who saves one from the bad condition of material existence. The Lord is called mukunda
because He not only saves the devotee from material existence but offers him transcendental bliss in love and
service.
As for Kesava, ka means Brahma, and isa means Lord Siva. The personality of Godhead captivates both Lord
Brahma and Lord Mahadeva, or Siva, by His transcendental qualities. Therefore He is called Kesava. This opinion is
given by Sanatana Gosvami in his Vaisnava-tosani commentary.
It is said that all the demigods, accompanied by Tri-nayana, Lord Siva, went to the shore of the ocean of milk and
offered their prayers through the mantra known as purusa-sukta. From this statement it is understood that the
demigods cannot directly approach Lord Visnu, who lies on the ocean of milk, or enter His abode. This is also
clearly stated in the Mahabharata, Moksa-dharma, and the next chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, has His abode in Goloka (goloka-namni nija-dhamni tale ca tasya). From Lord Krsna come
the catur-vyuha, the quadruple expansions Sankarsana, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Vasudeva. There are
innumerable brahmandas, all of which emanate from the pores of Karanodakasayi Visnu, and in every brahmanda
there is a Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who is a partial expansion of Aniruddha. This Aniruddha is a partial expansion of
Pradyumna, who is partially represented as Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Supersoul of all living entities. These Visnu
expansions are different from Krsna, who resides in Goloka Vrndavana. When it is said that the demigods offered
prayers to the Lord by chanting the purusa-sukta, this indicates that they pleased the Lord by enunciating prayers
of bhakti.
The word vrsakapi refers to one who satisfies His devotee in every way and frees His devotee from all material
anxieties. Vrsa refers to religious performances like sacrifices. Even without the execution of sacrifices, the Lord
can still enjoy the supermost comforts of the heavenly planets. The statement that Purusottama, Jagannatha, would
appear in the house of Vasudeva distinguishes the Supreme Personality of Godhead from ordinary persons. The
statement that He personally appeared indicates that He did not send His plenary expansion. The word priyartham
indicates that the Lord appeared to please Rukmini and Radharani. Priya means "the most beloved."
In the commentary of Sri Viraraghava Acarya, the following extra verse is accepted after text twenty-three:
rsayo 'pi tad-adesat
kalpyantam pasu-rupinah
payo-dana-mukhenapi
visnum tarpayitum surah
"O demigods, even great sages, following the order of Visnu, appeared in the forms of cows and calves to please
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by delivering milk."
Ramanujacarya sometimes accepts Baladeva as a saktyavesa-avatara, but Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained that
Baladeva is an expansion of Krsna and that a part of Baladeva is Sankarsana. Although Baladeva is identical with
Sankarsana, He is the origin of Sankarsana. Therefore the word svarat has been used to indicate that Baladeva
always exists in His own independence. The word svarat also indicates that Baladeva is beyond the material
conception of existence. Maya cannot attract Him, but because He is fully independent, He can appear by His
spiritual potency wherever He likes. Maya is fully under the control of Visnu. Because the material potency and
yogamaya mingle in the Lord's appearance, they are described as ekanamsa. Sometimes ekanamsa is interpreted to
mean "without differentiation." Sankarsana and Sesa-naga are identical. As stated by Yamunadevi, "O Rama, O
great-armed master of the world, who have extended Yourself throughout the entire universe by one plenary
expansion, it is not possible to understand You fully." Therefore ekamsa refers to Sesa-naga. In other words,
Baladeva, merely by His partial expansion, sustains the entire universe.
The word karyarthe refers to one who attracted the pregnancy of Devaki and bewildered mother Yasoda. These
pastimes are very confidential. The Supreme personality of Godhead ordered yogamaya to bewilder His associates
in His pastimes and bewilder demons like Kamsa. As stated previously, yogamayam samadisat. To give service to
the Lord, yogamaya appeared along with mahamaya. Mahamaya refers to yaya sammohitam jagat, "one who
bewilders the entire material world." From this statement it is to be understood that yogamaya, in her partial
expansion, becomes mahamaya and bewilders the conditioned souls. In other words, the entire creation has two
divisions--transcendental, or spiritual, and material. Yogamaya manages the spiritual world, and by her partial
expansion as mahamaya she manages the material world. As stated in the Narada-pancaratra, mahamaya is a partial
expansion of yogamaya. The Narada-pancaratra clearly states that the Supreme Personality has one potency, which
is sometimes described as Durga. The Brahma-samhita says, chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga. Durga is not
different from yogamaya. When one understands Durga properly, he is immediately liberated, for Durga is
originally the spiritual potency, hladini-sakti, by whose mercy one can understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead very easily. Radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini-saktir asmad. The mahamaya-sakti, however, is a
covering of yogamaya, and she is therefore called the covering potency. By this covering potency, the entire
material world is bewildered (yaya sammohitam jagat). In conclusion, bewildering the conditioned souls and
liberating the devotees are both functions belonging to yogamaya. Transferring the pregnancy of Devaki and
keeping mother Yasoda in deep sleep were both done by yogamaya; mahamaya cannot act upon such devotees, for
they are always liberated. But although it is not possible for mahamaya to control liberated souls or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, she did bewilder Kamsa. The action of yogamaya in presenting herself before Kamsa was
the action of mahamaya, not yogamaya. Yogamaya cannot even see or touch such polluted persons as Kamsa. In
Candi, in the Markandeya Purana, Eleventh Chapter, Mahamaya says, "During the twenty-eighth yuga in the
period of Vaivasvata Manu, I shall take birth as the daughter of Yasoda and be known as Vindhyacala-vasini."
The distinction between the two mayas--yogamaya and maha-maya--is described as follows. Krsna's rasa-lila with
the gopis and the gopis' bewilderment in respect to their husbands, fathers-in-law and other such relatives were
arrangements of yogamaya in which mahamaya had no influence. The Bhagavatam gives sufficient evidence of this
when it clearly says, yogamayam upasritah. On the other hand, there were asuras headed by Salva and ksatriyas like
Duryodhana who were bereft of devotional service in spite of seeing Krsna's carrier Garuda and the universal form,
and who could not understand Krsna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was also bewilderment, but
this bewilderment was due to mahamaya. Therefore it is to be concluded that the maya which drags a person from
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called jadamaya, and the maya which acts on the transcendental platform is
called yogamaya. When Nanda Maharaja was taken away by Varuna, he saw Krsna's opulence, but nonetheless he
thought of Krsna as his son. Such feelings of parental love in the spiritual world are acts of yogamaya, not of
jadamaya, or mahamaya. This is the opinion of Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.
Surasenams ca. The son of Kartaviryarjuna was Surasena, and the countries he ruled were also called Surasena.
This is noted by Sanatana Gosvami in his Vaisnava-tosani commentary.
In regard to Mathura, we find this quotation:
mathyate tu jagat sarvam
brahma-jnanena yena va
tat-sara-bhutam yad yasyam
mathura sa nigadyate
When a self-realized soul acts in his transcendental position, his situation is called Mathura. In other words,
when one acts in the process of bhakti-yoga, he may live anywhere, but actually he lives in Mathura, Vrndavana.
Devotion to Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, is the essence of all knowledge, and wherever such knowledge is
manifested is called Mathura. Also, when one establishes bhakti-yoga, excluding all other methods, one's situation
is called Mathura. Yatra nityam sannihito harih: the place where Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, lives
eternally is called Mathura. The word nitya indicates eternality. The Supreme Lord is eternal, and His abode is also
eternal. Goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah. Although the Lord is always stationed in His abode, Goloka
Vrndavana, He is present everywhere in fullness. This means that when the Supreme Lord descends on the surface
of the world, His original abode is not vacant, for He can remain in His original abode and simultaneously descend
upon Mathura, Vrndavana, Ayodhya and other places. He does not need to descend, since He is already present
there; He simply manifests Himself.
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami has addressed Maharaja Pariksit as tata, or "beloved son." This is due to parental love in
the heart of Sukadeva Gosvami. Because Krsna was soon coming as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, out of parental
affection Sukadeva Gosvami addressed Maharaja Pariksit as tata, "my dear son."
In the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word garbha is explained: garbho bhrune arbhake kuksav ity adi. When Kamsa
was about to kill Devaki, Vasudeva wanted to dissuade him by the diplomacy of sama and bheda. Sama means
"pacifying." Vasudeva wanted to pacify Kamsa by indicating relations, gain, welfare, identity and glorification.
Reference to these five concerns constitutes sama, and Vasudeva's presentation of fear in two situations--in this life
and the next--is called bheda. Thus Vasudeva used both sama and bheda to pacify Kamsa. praising Kamsa's
qualifications was glorification, and praising him as a descendant of the bhoja-vamsa appealed to sambandha,
relationship. Speaking of "your sister" was an appeal to identity. Speaking about killing a woman raises questions
about fame and welfare, and arousing fear of the sinful act of killing one's sister during her marriage ceremony is an
aspect of bheda. The Bhoja dynasty refers to those who were simply interested in sense gratification and were
therefore not very aristocratic. Another meaning of bhoja is "fighting." These were indications of defamation for
Kamsa. When Vasudeva addressed Kamsa as dina-vatsala, this was excessive praise. Kamsa would accept calves as a
form of revenue from his poor constituents, and therefore he was called dina-vatsala. Vasudeva knew very well that
he could not by force rescue Devaki from the imminent danger. Devaki was actually the daughter of Kamsa's uncle,
and therefore she is described as suhrt, meaning "relative." It is stated that Kamsa refrained from killing his close
relation Devaki because if he had killed her, a great fight would have ensued among the other members of the
family. Kamsa refrained from provoking this great danger of a family fight, for it would have caused many persons
to lose their lives.
Formerly an asura named Kalanemi had six sons, named Hamsa, Suvikrama, Kratha, Damana, Ripurmardana and
Krodhahanta. They were known as the sad-garbhas, or six garbhas, and they were all equally powerful and expert
in military affairs. These sad-garbhas gave up the association of Hiranyakasipu, their grandfather, and underwent
great austerities to satisfy Lord Brahma, who, upon being satisfied, agreed to give them whatever benediction they
might desire. When asked by Lord Brahma to state what they wanted, the sad-garbhas replied, "Dear Lord Brahma,
if you want to give us a benediction, give us the blessing that we will not be killed by any demigod, maha-roga,
Yaksa, Gandharva-pati, Siddha, Carana or human being, nor by great sages who are perfect in their penances and
austerities." Brahma understood their purpose and fulfilled their desire. But when Hiranyakasipu came to know of
these events, he was very angry at his grandsons. "You have given up my association and have gone to worship
Lord Brahma," he said, "and therefore I no longer have any affection for you. You have tried to save yourselves
from the hands of the demigods, but I curse you in this way: Your father will take birth as Kamsa and kill all of you
because you will take birth as sons of Devaki." Because of this curse, the grandsons of Hiranyakasipu had to take
birth from the womb of Devaki and be killed by Kamsa, although he was previously their father. This description is
mentioned in the Hari-vamsa, Visnu-parva, Second Chapter. According to the comments of the Vaisnava-tosani,
the son of Devaki known as Kirtiman was the third incarnation. In his first incarnation he was known as Smara and
was the son of Marici, and later he became the son of Kalanemi. This is mentioned in the histories.
An additional verse in this chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam is accepted by the Madhvacarya-sampradaya,
represented by Vijayadhvaja Tirtha. The verse is as follows:
atha kamsam upagamya
narado brahma-nandanah
ekantam upasangamya
vakyam etad uvaca ha
atha--in this way; kamsam--unto Kamsa; upagamya--after going; naradah--the great sage Narada; brahmanandanah--
who is the son of Brahma; ekantam upasangamya--after going to a very solitary place; vakyam--the
following instruction; etat--this; uvaca--said; ha--in the past.
Translation: "Thereafter, Narada, the mental son of Lord Brahma, approached Kamsa and, in a very solitary place,
informed him of the following news."
The great saint Narada descended from the heavenly planets to the forest of Mathura and sent his messenger to
Kamsa. When the messenger approached Kamsa and informed him of Narada's arrival, Kamsa, the leader of the
asuras, was very happy and immediately came out of his palace to receive Narada, who was as bright as the sun, as
powerful as fire, and free from all tinges of sinful activities. Kamsa accepted Narada as his guest, offered him
respectful obeisances and gave him a golden seat, brilliant like the sun. Narada was a friend of the King of heaven,
and thus he told Kamsa, the son of Ugrasena, "My dear hero, you have satisfied me with a proper reception, and
therefore I shall tell you something secret and confidential. While I was coming here from Nandakanana through
the Caitraratha forest, I saw a great meeting of the demigods, who followed me to Sumeru Parvata. We traveled
through many holy places, and finally we saw the holy Ganges. While Lord Brahma was consulting the other
demigods at the top of Sumeru Hill, I was also present with my stringed instrument, the vina. I shall tell you
confidentially that the meeting was held just to plan to kill the asuras, headed by you. You have a younger sister
named Devaki, and it is a fact that her eighth son will kill you." (reference: Hari-vamsa, Visnu-parva 1.2-16)
No one can blame Naradaji for encouraging Kamsa to kill the sons of Devaki. The saint Narada is always a wellwisher
for human society, and he wanted the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna, to descend to this world as
soon as possible so that the society of demigods would be pleased and would see Kamsa and his friends killed by
Krsna. Kamsa would also attain salvation from his nefarious activities, and this too would very much please the
demigods and their followers. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks in this connection that Narada Muni
sometimes did things that were beneficial to the demigods and the demons simultaneously. Sri Viraraghava Acarya,
in his commentary, has included the following half-verse in this regard: asurah sarva evaita lokopadrava-karinah.
Asuras are always disturbing elements for human society.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Advent of Lord Krsna: Introduction."
Chapter Two
Prayers by the Demigods for Lord Krsna in the Womb
As described in this chapter, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead entered the womb of Devaki to kill
Kamsa, all the demigods understood that the Lord was living within Devaki's womb, and therefore in veneration
they offered Him the Garbha-stuti prayers.
Kamsa, under the protection of his father-in-law, Jarasandha, and with the help of his demoniac friends like
Pralamba, Baka, Canura, Trnavarta, Aghasura, Mustika, Bana and Bhaumasura, began oppressing the members of
the Yadu dynasty. Therefore, the members of the Yadu dynasty left their homes and sought shelter in such states as
Kuru, Pancala, Kekaya, Salva and Vidarbha. Only some of them stayed with Kamsa, as nominal friends.
After Kamsa killed the sad-garbhas, the six sons of Devaki, one after another, Anantadeva entered Devaki's womb
and was transferred to the womb of Rohini by the manipulation of Yogamaya, who was following the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord Himself, who was soon to appear as the eighth son of Devaki, ordered
Yogamaya to take birth from the womb of Yasodadevi. Because Krsna and His potency, Yogamaya, appeared
simultaneously as brother and sister, the world is full of Vaisnavas and saktas, and there is certainly some rivalry
between them. Vaisnavas worship the Supreme Lord, whereas saktas, according to their desires, worship Yogamaya
in forms like Durga, Bhadrakali and Candika. Following the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Yogamaya transferred Baladeva, Sankarsana, the seventh child of Devaki, from the womb of Devaki to the womb of
Rohini. Because Sankarsana appears in order to increase love of Krsna, He is known as Baladeva. One may take
auspicious strength from Him to become a devotee of the Lord, and therefore He is also known as Balabhadra.
After Yogamaya transferred the seventh child of Devaki to the womb of Rohini, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead appeared within the heart of Vasudeva and transferred Himself into the heart of Devaki. Because the Lord
was present in her heart, Devaki, as her pregnancy continued, appeared effulgent. Upon seeing this effulgence,
Kamsa was full of anxiety, but he could not harm Devaki because of their family relationship. Thus he began
indirectly thinking of Krsna and became fully Krsna conscious.
Meanwhile, because of the Lord's presence within the womb of Devaki, all the demigods came to offer the Lord
their prayers. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, they said, is eternally the Absolute Truth. The spiritual soul is
more important than the gross body, and the Supersoul, Paramatma, is still more important than the soul. The
Supreme Godhead is absolutely independent, and His incarnations are transcendental. The prayers of the demigods
glorify and exalt devotees and explain the fate of persons who superficially consider themselves liberated from the
conditions of material nature. A devotee is always safe. When a devotee fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the
Lord, he is completely liberated from the fear of material existence. By explaining why the Supreme Personality of
Godhead descends, the prayers of the demigods clearly confirm the Lord's statement in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself."

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Under the protection of Magadharaja, Jarasandha, the powerful Kamsa began
persecuting the kings of the Yadu dynasty. In this he had the cooperation of demons like Pralamba, Baka, Canura,
Trnavarta, Aghasura, Mustika, Arista, Dvivida, Putana, Kesi, Dhenuka, Banasura, Narakasura and many other
demoniac kings on the surface of the earth.
This verse supports the following statement given by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita (4.7-8):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam

"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to
reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium."
The Lord's purpose in maintaining this material world is to give everyone a chance to go back home, back to
Godhead, but kings and political leaders unfortunately try to hinder the purpose of the Lord, and therefore the
Lord appears, either personally or with His plenary portions, to set things right. It is therefore said:
garbham sancarya rohinyam
devakya yogamayaya
tasyah kuksim gatah krsno
dvitiyo vibudhaih stutah
"Krsna appeared in the womb of Devaki after transferring Baladeva to the womb of Rohini by the power of
Yogamaya." Yadubhih sa vyarudhyata. The kings of the Yadu dynasty were all devotees, but there were many
powerful demons, such as Salva, who began to persecute them. At that time, Jarasandha, who was Kamsa's fatherin-
law, was extremely powerful, and therefore Kamsa took advantage of his protection and the help of the demons
in persecuting the kings of the Yadu dynasty. The demons naturally appeared more powerful than the demigods,
but ultimately, because of help received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons were defeated and
the demigods triumphant.

Some of their relatives, however, began to follow Kamsa's principles and act in his service. After Kamsa, the son
of Ugrasena, killed the six sons of Devaki, a plenary portion of Krsna entered her womb as her seventh child,
arousing her pleasure and her lamentation. That plenary portion is celebrated by great sages as Ananta, who
belongs to Krsna's second quadruple expansion.
Some of the chief devotees, such as Akrura, stayed with Kamsa to satisfy him. This they did for various purposes.
They all expected the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear as the eighth child as soon as Devaki's other
children were killed by Kamsa, and they were eagerly awaiting His appearance. By remaining in Kamsa's
association, they would be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead take birth and display His childhood
pastimes, and Akrura would later go to Vrndavana to bring Krsna and Balarama to Mathura. The word paryupasate
is significant because it indicates that some devotees wanted to stay near Kamsa in order to see all these pastimes of
the Lord. The six children killed by Kamsa had formerly been sons of Marici, but because of having been cursed by
a brahmana, they were obliged to take birth as grandsons of Hiranyakasipu. Kamsa had taken birth as Kalanemi,
and now he was obliged to kill his own sons. This was a mystery. As soon as the sons of Devaki were killed, they
would return to their original place. The devotees wanted to see this also. Generally speaking, no one kills his own
nephews, but Kamsa was so cruel that he did so without hesitation. Ananta, Sankarsana, belongs to the second
catur-vyuha, or quadruple expansion. This is the opinion of experienced commentators.

viditva--understanding the position of the Yadus and His other devotees; kamsa-jam--because of Kamsa; bhayam--

To protect the Yadus, His personal devotees, from Kamsa's attack, the Personality of Godhead, Visvatma, the
Supreme Soul of everyone, ordered Yogamaya as follows.
The words bhagavan api visvatma viditva kamsajam bhayam are commented upon by Srila Sanatana Gosvami.
Bhagavan svayam is Krsna (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). He is Visvatma, the original Supersoul of everyone,
because his plenary portion expands as the Supersoul. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (13.3): ksetra jnam capi
mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata. Lord Krsna is the ksetra jna, or Supersoul, of all living entities. He is the
original source of all expansions of the Personality of Godhead. There are hundreds and thousands of plenary
expansions of Visnu, such as Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Vasudeva, but here in this material world,
the Visvatma, the Supersoul for all living entities, is Ksirodakasayi Visnu. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61),
isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese'rjuna tisthati: "The Supreme Lord is situated in the heart of all living entities, O
Arjuna." Krsna is actually Visvatma by His plenary expansion as visnu-tattva, yet because of His affection for His
devotees, He acts as Supersoul to give them directions (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam
apohanam ca).
The affairs of the Supersoul pertain to Ksirodakasayi Visnu, but Krsna took compassion on Devaki, His devotee,
because He understood her fear of Kamsa's persecution. A pure devotee is always fearful of material existence. No
one knows what will happen next, for one may have to change his body at any moment (tatha dehantara-praptih).
Knowing this fact, a pure devotee acts in such a way that he will not have his life spoiled by being obliged to accept
another body and undergo the tribulations of material existence. This is bhayam, or fear. Bhayam
dvitiyabhinivesatah syat (Bhag. 11.2.37). This fear is due to material existence. Properly speaking, everyone should
always be alert and fearful of material existence, but although everyone is prone to be affected by the ignorance of
material existence, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is always alert to the protection of His devotees.
Krsna is so kind and affectionate toward His devotees that He helps them by giving them the intelligence by which
to exist in this material world without forgetting Him even for a moment. The Lord says:
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajnana-jam tamah
nasayamy atma-bhavastho
jnana-dipena bhasvata
"Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the
darkness born of ignorance." (Bg. 10.11)
The word yoga means "link." Any system of yoga is an attempt to reconnect our broken relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are different types of yoga, of which bhakti-yoga is the best. In other yoga
systems, one must undergo various processes before attaining perfection, but bhakti-yoga is direct. The Lord says
in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is
most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." For the bhakti-yogi, a human body is guaranteed
in his next existence, as stated by Lord Krsna (sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate). Yogamaya is the
spiritual potency of the Lord. Out of affection for His devotees, the Lord always stays in spiritual touch with them,
although otherwise His maya potency is so strong that she bewilders even exalted demigods like Brahma. Therefore
the Lord's potency is called yogamaya. Since the Lord is Visvatma, He immediately ordered Yogamaya to give
protection to Devaki.

Maharaja. Other wives of Vasudeva are also living there incognito because of fear of Kamsa. Please go there.
Nanda-gokula, the residence of King Nanda, was itself very beautiful, and when Yogamaya was ordered to go

the ability to create such an atmosphere, the Lord ordered her to go to Nanda-gokula.

devakyah--of Devaki; jathare--within the womb; garbham--the embryo; sesa-akhyam--known as Sesa, the plenary
expansion of Krsna; dhama--the plenary expansion; mamakam--of Me; tat--Him; sannikrsya--attracting; rohinyah--
of Rohini; udare--within the womb; sannivesaya--transfer without difficulty.
Within the womb of Devaki is My partial plenary expansion known as Sankarsana or Sesa. Without difficulty,
transfer Him into the womb of Rohini.
The first plenary expansion of Krsna is Baladeva, also known as Sesa. The Sesa incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead supports the entire universe, and the eternal mother of this incarnation is mother Rohini.
"Because I am going into the womb of Devaki," the Lord told Yogamaya, "the Sesa incarnation has already gone
there and made suitable arrangements so that I may live there. Now He should enter the womb of Rohini, His
eternal mother."
In this connection, one may ask how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated
transcendentally, could enter the womb of Devaki, which had previously been entered by the six asuras, the sadgarbhas.
Does this mean that the Sad-garbhasuras were equal to the transcendental body of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead? The following answer is given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.
The entire creation, as well as its individual parts, is an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore, even though the Lord enters the material world, He does not do so. This is explained by the
Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.4-5):
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
na ca mat-sthani bhutani
pasya me yogam aisvaram
bhuta-bhrn na ca bhuta-stho
mamatma bhuta-bhavanah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer
of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, My Self is the very source of creation." Sarvam khalv idam
brahma. Everything is an expansion of Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet everything is not the
Supreme Godhead, and He is not everywhere. Everything rests upon Him and yet does not rest upon Him. This can
be explained only through the acintya-bhedabheda philosophy. Such truths cannot be understood, however, unless
one is a pure devotee, for the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi
tattvatah: "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." Even though the Lord
cannot be understood by ordinary persons, this principle should be understood from the statement of the sastras.
A pure devotee is always transcendentally situated because of executing nine different processes of bhakti-yoga
(sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam).
Thus situated in devotional service, a devotee, although in the material world, is not in the material world. Yet a
devotee always fears, "Because I am associated with the material world, so many contaminations affect me."
Therefore he is always alert in fear, which gradually diminishes his material association.
Symbolically, mother Devaki's constant fear of Kamsa was purifying her. A pure devotee should always fear
material association, and in this way all the asuras of material association will be killed, as the sad-garbhasuras
were killed by Kamsa. It is said that from the mind, Marici appears. In other words, Marici is an incarnation of the
mind. Marici has six sons: Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and Matsarya (lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness
and envy). The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in pure devotional service. This is confirmed in the
Vedas: bhaktir evainam darsayati. Only bhakti can bring one in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared from the womb of Devaki, and therefore Devaki symbolically
represents bhakti, and Kamsa symbolically represents material fear. When a pure devotee always fears material
association, his real position of bhakti is manifested, and he naturally becomes uninterested in material enjoyment.
When the six sons of Marici are killed by such fear and one is freed from material contamination, within the womb
of bhakti the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears. Thus the seventh pregnancy of Devaki signifies the
appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After the six sons Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada and
Matsarya are killed, the Sesa incarnation creates a suitable situation for the appearance of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In other words, when one awakens his natural Krsna consciousness, Lord Krsna appears. This is the
explanation given by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.

appear as the daughter of mother Yasoda, the queen of Maharaja Nanda.
The word amsa-bhagena is important in this verse. In Bhagavad-gita (10.42) the Lord says:
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and
support this entire universe." Everything is situated as a part of the Supreme Lord's potency. In regard to Lord
Krsna's appearance in the womb of Devaki, Brahma played a part also because on the bank of the milk ocean he
requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. A part was also played by Baladeva, the first expansion of
Godhead. Similarly, Yogamaya, who appeared as the daughter of mother Yasoda, also played a part. Thus jivatattva,
visnu-tattva and sakti-tattva are all integrated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when Krsna
appears, He appears with all His integrated parts. As explained in previous verses, Yogamaya was requested to
attract Sankarsana, Baladeva, from the womb of Devaki to the womb of Rohini, and this was a very heavy task for
her. Yogamaya naturally could not see how it was possible for her to attract Sankarsana. Therefore Krsna addressed
her as subhe, auspicious, and said, "Be blessed. Take power from Me, and you will be able to do it." By the grace of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, anyone can do anything, for the Lord is present in everything, all things
being His parts and parcels (amsa-bhagena) and increasing or decreasing by His supreme will. Balarama was only
fifteen days older than Krsna. By the blessings of Krsna, Yogamaya became the daughter of mother Yasoda, but by
the supreme will she was not able to enjoy the parental love of her father and mother. Krsna, however, although
not actually born from the womb of mother Yasoda, enjoyed the parental love of mother Yasoda and Nanda. By the
blessings of Krsna, Yogamaya was able to achieve the reputation of being the daughter of mother Yasoda, who also
became famous by the blessings of Krsna. Yasoda means "one who gives fame."

sarva-kama-vara-pradam
arcisyanti--will worship; manusyah--human society; tvam--unto you; sarva-kama-vara-isvarim--because you are
the best of the demigods who can fulfill all material desires; dhupa--by incense; upahara--by presentations;
balibhih--by different types of worship through sacrifice; sarva-kama--of all material desires; vara--the blessings;
pradam--one who can bestow.
By sacrifices of animals, ordinary human beings will worship you gorgeously, with various paraphernalia, because
you are supreme in fulfilling the material desires of everyone.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah: "Those whose minds are
distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods." Therefore the word manusya, meaning "human being,"
here refers to one who does not know the actual goal of life. Such a person wants to enjoy the material world by
taking birth in a highly elevated family with the benefits of education, beauty and immense wealth, which in this
material world are desirable. One who has forgotten the real aim of life may worship goddess Durga, maya-sakti,
under various names, for different purposes, and in different places. As there are many holy places for the worship
of Krsna, there are also many holy places in India for the worship of Durgadevi, or Mayadevi, who took birth as the
daughter of Yasoda. After cheating Kamsa, Mayadevi dispersed herself to various places, especially in Vindhyacala,
to accept regular worship from ordinary men. A human being should actually be interested in understanding atmatattva,
the truth of atma, the spirit soul, and Paramatma, the supreme soul. Those who are interested in atma-tattva
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati). However, as
explained in the next verse of this chapter, those who cannot understand atma-tattva (apasyatam atma-tattvam)
worship Yogamaya in her different features. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.2) says:
srotavyadini rajendra
nrnam santi sahasrasah
apasyatam atma-tattvam
grhesu grha-medhinam
"Those persons who are materially engrossed, being blind to the knowledge of ultimate truth, have many subject
matters for hearing in human society, O Emperor." Those who are interested in remaining in this material world
and are not interested in spiritual salvation have many duties, but for one who is interested in spiritual salvation,
the only duty is to surrender fully unto Krsna (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). Such a person
is not interested in material enjoyment.

name Sarada; iti--thus; ambika--the name Ambika; iti--also; ca--and.
Lord Krsna blessed Mayadevi by saying: In different places on the surface of the earth, people will give you
different names, such as Durga, Bhadrakali, Vijaya, Vaisnavi, Kumuda, Candika, Krsna, Madhavi, Kanyaka, Maya,
Narayani, Isani, Sarada and Ambika.
Because Krsna and His energy appeared simultaneously, people have generally formed two groups--the saktas and
the Vaisnavas--and sometimes there is rivalry between them. Essentially, those who are interested in material
enjoyment are saktas, and those interested in spiritual salvation and attaining the spiritual kingdom are Vaisnavas.
Because people are generally interested in material enjoyment, they are interested in worshiping Mayadevi, the
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaisnavas, however, are suddha-saktas, or pure bhaktas, because
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra indicates worship of the Supreme Lord's energy, Hara. A Vaisnava prays to the energy
of the Lord for the opportunity to serve the Lord along with His spiritual energy. Thus Vaisnavas all worship such
Deities as Radha-Krsna, Sita-Rama, Laksmi-Narayana and Rukmini-Dvarakadhisa, whereas durga-saktas worship
the material energy under different names.
The names by which Mayadevi is known in different places have been listed by Vallabhacarya as follows. In
Varanasi she is known as Durga, in Avanti she is known as Bhadrakali, in Orissa she is known as Vijaya, and in
Kulahapura she is known as Vaisnavi or Mahalaksmi. (The representatives of Mahalaksmi and Ambika are present
in Bombay.) In the country known as Kamarupa she is known as Candika, in Northern India as Sarada, and in
Cape Comorin as Kanyaka. Thus she is distributed according to various names in various places.
Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirthapada, in his pada-ratnavali-tika, has explained the meanings of the different
representations. Maya is known as Durga because she is approached with great difficulty, as Bhadra because she is
auspicious, and as Kali because she is deep blue. Because she is the most powerful energy, she is known as Vijaya;
because she is one of the different energies of Visnu, she is known as Vaisnavi; and because she enjoys in this
material world and gives facilities for material enjoyment, she is known as Kumuda. Because she is very severe to
her enemies, the asuras, she is known as Candika, and because she gives all sorts of material facilities, she is called
Krsna. In this way the material energy is differently named and situated in different places on the surface of the
globe.

The son of Rohini will also be celebrated as Sankarsana because of being sent from the womb of Devaki to the
womb of Rohini. He will be called Rama because of His ability to please all the inhabitants of Gokula, and He will
be known as Balabhadra because of His extensive physical strength.
These are some of the reasons why Balarama is known as Sankarsana, Balarama or sometimes Rama. In the mahamantra--
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--people
sometimes object when Rama is accepted as Balarama. But although devotees of Lord Rama may object, they
should know that there is no difference between Balarama and Lord Rama. Here Srimad-Bhagavatam clearly states
that Balarama is also known as Rama (rameti). Therefore, it is not artificial for us to speak of Lord Balarama as Lord
Rama. Jayadeva Gosvami also speaks of three Ramas: Parasurama, Raghupati Rama and Balarama. All of them are
Ramas.

sandista--having been ordered; evam--thus; bhagavata--by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tatha iti--so be it;
om--affirmation by the mantra om; iti--thus; tat-vacah--His words; pratigrhya--accepting the order; parikramya--
after circumambulating Him; gam--to the surface of the globe; gata--she immediately went; tat--the order, as given
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tatha--just so; akarot--executed.
Thus instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yogamaya immediately agreed. With the Vedic mantra
om, she confirmed that she would do what He asked. Thus having accepted the order of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, she circumambulated Him and started for the place on earth known as Nanda-gokula. There she did
everything just as she had been told.
After receiving the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yogamaya twice confirmed her acceptance by
saying, "Yes, sir, I shall do as You order," and then saying om. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that
om signifies Vedic confirmation. Thus Yogamaya very faithfully received the Lord's order as a Vedic injunction. It
is a fact that whatever is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a Vedic injunction that no one should
neglect. In Vedic injunctions there are no mistakes, illusions, cheating or imperfection. Unless one understands the
authority of the Vedic version, there is no purpose in quoting sastra. No one should violate the Vedic injunctions.
Rather, one should strictly execute the orders given in the Vedas. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (16.24):
tasmac chastram pramanam te
karyakarya-vyavasthitau
jnatva sastra-vidhanoktam
karma kartum iharhasi
"One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such
rules and regulations, one should act so that one may gradually be elevated."

garbhe pranite devakya

garbhe--when the embryo; pranite--was carried from the womb; devakyah--of Devaki; rohinim--to the womb of
Rohini; yoga-nidraya--by the spiritual energy called Yogamaya; aho--alas; visramsitah--is lost; garbhah--the embryo;
iti--thus; paurah--all the inhabitants of the house; vicukrusuh--lamented.
When the child of Devaki was attracted and transferred into the womb of Rohini by Yogamaya, Devaki seemed to
have a miscarriage. Thus all the inhabitants of the palace loudly lamented, "Alas, Devaki has lost her child!"
"All the inhabitants of the palace" includes Kamsa. When everyone lamented, Kamsa joined in compassion,
thinking that perhaps because of drugs or some other external means, Devaki had undergone this abortion. The
real story of what happened after Yogamaya attracted the child of Devaki into the womb of Rohini in the seventh
month of Rohini's pregnancy is described as follows in the Hari-vamsa. At midnight, while Rohini was deeply
sleeping, she experienced, as if in a dream, that she had undergone a miscarriage. After some time, when she
awoke, she saw that this had indeed happened, and she was in great anxiety. But Yogamaya then informed her, "O
auspicious lady, your child is now being replaced. I am attracting a child from the womb of Devaki, and therefore
your child will be known as Sankarsana."
The word yoga-nidra is significant. When one is spiritually reconnected through self-realization, one regards his
material life as having been like a dream. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.69):
ya nisa sarva-bhutanam
tasyam jagarti samyami
yasyam jagrati bhutani
sa nisa pasyato muneh
"What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all
beings is night for the introspective sage." The stage of self-realization is called yoga-nidra. All material activities
appear to be a dream when one is spiritually awakened. Thus yoga-nidra may be explained to be Yogamaya.

bhagavan api visvatma
bhaktanam abhayankarah
avivesamsa-bhagena
mana anakadundubheh
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; api--also; visvatma--the Supersoul of all living entities;
bhaktanam--of His devotees; abhayam-karah--always killing the causes of fear; avivesa--entered; amsa-bhagena--
with all of His potential opulences (Sad-aisvarya-purna); manah--in the mind; anakadundubheh--of Vasudeva.
Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul of all living entities and who vanquishes all the
fear of His devotees, entered the mind of Vasudeva in full opulence.
The word visvatma refers to one who is situated in everyone's heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna
tisthati). Another meaning of visvatma is "the only lovable object for everyone." Because of forgetfulness of this
object, people are suffering in this material world, but if one fortunately revives his old consciousness of loving
Krsna and connects with Visvatma, one becomes perfect. The Lord is described in the Third Canto (3.2.15) as
follows: paravareso mahad-amsa-yukto hy ajo 'pi jato bhagavan. Although unborn, the Lord, the master of
everything, appears like a born child by entering the mind of a devotee. The Lord is already there within the mind,
and consequently it is not astonishing for Him to appear as if born from a devotee's body. The word avivesa
signifies that the Lord appeared within the mind of Vasudeva. There was no need for a discharge of semen. That is
the opinion of Sripada Sridhara Svami and Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. In the Vaisnava-tosani, Srila
Sanatana Gosvami says that consciousness was awakened within the mind of Vasudeva. Srila Viraraghava Acarya
also says that Vasudeva was one of the demigods and that within his mind the Supreme Personality of Godhead
appeared as an awakening of consciousness.

sah--he (Vasudeva); bibhrat--carried; paurusam--pertaining to the Supreme Person; dhama--the spiritual
effulgence; bhrajamanah--illuminating; yatha--as; ravih--the sunshine; durasadah--very difficult even to look at,
difficult to understand by sensory perception; ati-durdharsah--approachable with great difficulty; bhutanam--of all
living entities; sambabhuva--so he became; ha--positively.
While carrying the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of his heart, Vasudeva bore the
Lord's transcendentally illuminating effulgence, and thus he became as bright as the sun. He was therefore very
difficult to see or approach through sensory perception. Indeed, he was unapproachable and unperceivable even for
such formidable men as Kamsa, and not only for Kamsa but for all living entities.
The word dhama is significant. Dhama refers to the place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides. In
the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.1) it is said, dhamna svena sada nirasta-kuhakam satyam param dhimahi.
In the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no influence of material energy (dhamna svena sada
nirasta-kuhakam). Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present by His name, form, qualities or
paraphernalia immediately becomes a dhama. For example, we speak of Vrndavana-dhama, Dvaraka-dhama and
Mathura-dhama because in these places the name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia of the Supreme Godhead are
always present. Similarly, if one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to do something, the core of
his heart becomes a dhama, and thus he becomes so extraordinarily powerful that not only his enemies but also
people in general are astonished to observe his activities. Because he is unapproachable, his enemies are simply
struck with wonder, as explained here by the words durasado 'tidurdharsah.
The words paurusam dhama have been explained by various acaryas. Sri Viraraghava Acarya says that these
words refer to the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vijayadhvaja says that they signify visnutejas,
and Sukadeva says bhagavat-svarupa. The Vaisnava-tosani says that these words indicate the influence of the
Supreme Lord's effulgence, and Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that they signify the appearance of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

tato jagan-mangalam acyutamsam

dadhara sarvatmakam atma-bhutam
kastha yathananda-karam manastah
tatah--thereafter; jagat-mangalam--auspiciousness for all living entities in all the universes of the creation; acyutaamsam--
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never bereft of the six opulences, all of which are present in
all His plenary expansions; samahitam--fully transferred; sura-sutena--by Vasudeva, the son of Surasena; devi--
Devaki-devi; dadhara--carried; sarva-atmakam--the Supreme Soul of everyone; atma-bhutam--the cause of all
causes; kastha--the east; yatha--just as; ananda-karam--the blissful (moon); manastah--being placed within the
mind.
Thereafter, accompanied by plenary expansions, the fully opulent Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is allauspicious
for the entire universe, was transferred from the mind of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaki. Devaki,
having thus been initiated by Vasudeva, became beautiful by carrying Lord Krsna, the original consciousness for
everyone, the cause of all causes, within the core of her heart, just as the east becomes beautiful by carrying the
rising moon.
As indicated here by the word manastah, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was transferred from the core of
Vasudeva's mind or heart to the core of the heart of Devaki. We should note carefully that the Lord was transferred
to Devaki not by the ordinary way for a human being, but by diksa, initiation. Thus the importance of initiation is
mentioned here. Unless one is initiated by the right person, who always carries within his heart the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one cannot acquire the power to carry the Supreme Godhead within the core of one's own
heart.
The word acyutamsam is used because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Sad-aisvarya-purna, full in the
opulences of wealth, strength, fame, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. The Supreme Godhead is never
separated from His personal opulences. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.39), ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena
tisthan: the Lord is always situated with all His plenary expansions, such as Rama, Nrsimha and Varaha. Therefore
the word acyutamsam is specifically used here, signifying that the Lord is always present with His plenary
expansions and opulences. There is no need to think of the Lord artificially as yogis do. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena
manasa pasyanti yam yoginah (Bhag. 12.13.1). Yogis meditate upon the Supreme person within the mind. For a
devotee, however, the Lord is present, and His presence need only be awakened through initiation by a bona fide
spiritual master. The Lord did not need to live within the womb of Devaki, for His presence within the core of her
heart was sufficient to carry Him. One is here forbidden to think that Krsna was begotten by Vasudeva within the
womb of Devaki and that she carried the child within her womb.
When Vasudeva was sustaining the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, he appeared
just like the glowing sun, whose shining rays are always unbearable and scorching to the common man. The form
of the Lord situated in the pure, unalloyed heart of Vasudeva is not different from the original form of Krsna. The
appearance of the form of Krsna anywhere, and specifically within the heart, is called dhama. Dhama refers not
only to Krsna's form, but to His name, His form, His quality and His paraphernalia. Everything becomes manifest
simultaneously.
Thus the eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full potencies was transferred from the mind
of Vasudeva to the mind of Devaki, exactly as the setting sun's rays are transferred to the full moon rising in the
east.
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered the body of Devaki from the body of Vasudeva. He was
beyond the conditions of the ordinary living entity. When Krsna is there, it is to be understood that all His plenary
expansions, such as Narayana, and incarnations like Lord Nrsimha and Varaha, are with Him, and they are not
subject to the conditions of material existence. In this way, Devaki became the residence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is one without a second and the cause of all creation. Devaki became the residence of
the Absolute Truth, but because she was within the house of Kamsa, she looked just like a suppressed fire, or like
misused education. When fire is covered by the walls of a pot or is kept in a jug, the illuminating rays of the fire
cannot be very much appreciated. Similarly, misused knowledge, which does not benefit the people in general, is
not very much appreciated. So Devaki was kept within the prison walls of Kamsa's palace, and no one could see her
transcendental beauty, which resulted from her conceiving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Commenting upon this verse, Sri Viraraghava Acarya writes, vasudeva-devaki jatharayor hrdayayor bhagavatah
sambandhah. The Supreme Lord's entrance into the womb of Devaki from the heart of Vasudeva was a heart-toheart
relationship.

one who possesses knowledge but cannot distribute it; yatha--or just as; sati--so being.
Devaki then kept within herself the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the foundation of
the entire cosmos, but because she was under arrest in the house of Kamsa, she was like the flames of a fire covered
by the walls of a pot, or like a person who has knowledge but cannot distribute it to the world for the benefit of
human society.
In this verse the word jnana-khala is most significant. Knowledge is meant for distribution. Although there is
already much scientific knowledge, whenever scientists or philosophers awaken to a particular type of knowledge,
they try to distribute it throughout the world, for otherwise the knowledge gradually dries up and no one benefits
from it. India has the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, but unfortunately, for some reason or other, this sublime
knowledge of the science of God was not distributed throughout the world, although it is meant for all of human
society. Therefore Krsna Himself appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and ordered all Indians to take up the cause
of distributing the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita throughout the entire world.
yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa
amara ajnaya guru hana tara' ei desa
"Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Sri Krsna as they are given in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land." (Cc. Madhya 7.128)
Although India has the sublime knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, Indians have not done their proper duty of
distributing it. Now, therefore, the Krsna consciousness movement has been set up to distribute this knowledge as
it is, without distortion. Although previously there were attempts to distribute the knowledge of Bhagavad-gita,
these attempts involved distortion and compromise with mundane knowledge. But now the Krsna consciousness
movement, without mundane compromises, is distributing Bhagavad-gita as it is, and people are deriving the
benefits of awakening to Krsna consciousness and becoming devotees of Lord Krsna. Therefore the proper
distribution of knowledge has begun by which not only will the whole world benefit, but India's glory will be
magnified in human society. Kamsa tried to arrest Krsna consciousness within his house (bhojendra-gehe), with
the result that Kamsa, with all his opulences, was later vanquished. Similarly, the real knowledge of Bhagavad-gita
was being choked by unscrupulous Indian leaders, with the result that India's culture, and knowledge of the
Supreme were being lost. Now, however, because Krsna consciousness is spreading, the proper use of Bhagavadgita
is being attempted.

Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead was within her womb, Devaki illuminated the entire atmosphere in

The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." In this age, at the present moment, there are inordinate discrepancies
in the discharge of human duties. Human life is meant for God realization, but unfortunately the materialistic
civilization is stressing only the senses of the body, not understanding the living force within the body. As clearly
stated in Bhagavad-gita (dehino 'smin yatha dehe), within the body is the body's proprietor, the living force, which
is more important. But human society has become so fallen that instead of understanding the living force within
the body, people have become busy with external things. This is a discrepancy in human duties. Therefore Krsna
has taken birth or taken shelter within the womb of the Krsna consciousness movement. Men of Kamsa's class,
therefore, are very much afraid and are busy trying to stop this movement, especially in the Western countries. One
politician has remarked that the Krsna consciousness movement is spreading like an epidemic and that if not
checked immediately, within ten years it may capture governmental power. There is, of course, such potency in the
Krsna consciousness movement. As stated by authorities (Cc. Adi 17.22), kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: in
this age, Krsna has appeared in the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. The Krsna consciousness movement is spreading like
wildfire all over the world, and it will go on doing so. Men who are like Kamsa are very much afraid of the
movement's progress and acceptance by the younger generation, but as Krsna could not be killed by Kamsa, this
movement cannot be checked by men of Kamsa's class. The movement will go on increasing more and more,
provided the leaders of the movement remain firmly Krsna conscious by following the regulative principles and the
primary activities of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra regularly.

yasah sriyam hanty anukalam ayuh
kim--what; adya--now, immediately; tasmin--in this situation; karaniyam--is to be done; asu--without delay; me--
my duty; yat--because; artha-tantrah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always determined to protect
the sadhus and kill the asadhus; na--does not; vihanti--give up; vikramam--His prowess; striyah--of a woman;
svasuh--of my sister; guru-matyah--especially when she is pregnant; vadhah ayam--the killing; yasah--fame;
sriyam--opulence; hanti--will vanquish; anukalam--forever; ayuh--and the duration of life.
Kamsa thought: What is my duty now? The Supreme Lord, who knows His purpose [paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam], will not give up His prowess. Devaki is a woman, she is my sister, and moreover she is now
pregnant. If I kill her, my reputation, opulence and duration of life will certainly be vanquished.
According to Vedic principles, a woman, a brahmana, an old man, a child and a cow should never be killed. It
appears that Kamsa, although a great enemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was aware of the Vedic
culture and conscious of the fact that the soul transmigrates from one body to another and that one suffers in the
next life according to the karmas of this life. Therefore he was afraid of killing Devaki, since she was a woman, she
was his sister, and she was pregnant. A ksatriya becomes famous by performing heroic acts. But what would be
heroic about killing a woman who, while confined in his custody, was under his shelter? Therefore, he did not
want to act drastically by killing Devaki. Kamsa's enemy was within Devaki's womb, but killing an enemy in such a
nescient state would not be an exhibition of prowess. According to ksatriya rules, an enemy should be fought face
to face and with proper weapons. Then if the enemy is killed, the victor becomes famous. Kamsa very
conscientiously deliberated upon these facts and therefore refrained from killing Devaki, although he was
completely confident that his enemy had already appeared within her womb.

sa esa jivan khalu sampareto

sah--he; esah--that jealous person; jivan--while living; khalu--even; samparetah--is dead; varteta--continues to
live; yah--anyone who; atyanta--very much; nrsamsitena--by executing cruel activities; dehe--when the body; mrte--

life; tanu-maninah--of a person in the bodily concept of life; dhruvam--without a doubt.
A person who is very cruel is regarded as dead even while living, for while he is living or after his death, everyone
condemns him. And after the death of a person in the bodily concept of life, he is undoubtedly transferred to the
hell known as Andhatama.
Kamsa considered that if he killed his sister, while living he would be condemned by everyone, and after death he
would go to the darkest region of hellish life because of his cruelty. It is said that a cruel person like a butcher is
advised not to live and not to die. While living, a cruel person creates a hellish condition for his next birth, and
therefore he should not live; but he is also advised not to die, because after death he must go to the darkest region
of hell. Thus in either circumstance he is condemned. Kamsa, therefore, having good sense about the science of the
soul's transmigration, deliberately refrained from killing Devaki.
In this verse the words ganta tamo 'ndham tanu-manino dhruvam are very important and require extensive
understanding. Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his Vaisnava-tosani-tika, says: tatra tanu-maninah papina iti dehatmabuddhyaiva
papabhiniveso bhavati. One who lives in the bodily concept, thinking, "I am this body," involves
himself, by the very nature of this conception, in a life of sinful activities. Anyone living in such a conception is to
be considered a candidate for hell.
adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
(Bhag. > 7.5.30)
One who is in a bodily concept of life has no control over sense gratification. Such a person can do anything
sinful to eat, drink, be merry and enjoy a life of sense gratification, not knowing of the soul's transmigration from
one body to another. Such a person does whatever he likes, whatever he imagines, and therefore, being subject to
the laws of nature, he suffers miserably again and again in different material bodies.
yavat kriyas tavad idam mano vai
karmatmakam yena sarira-bandhah
(Bhag. 5.5.5)
In the bodily concept of life, a person is karmanubandha, or conditioned by karma, and as long as the mind is
absorbed in karma, one must accept a material body. Sarira-bandha, bondage to the material body, is a source of
misery (klesa-da).
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
Although the body is temporary, it always gives one trouble in many ways, but human civilization is now
unfortunately based on tanu-mani, the bodily concept of life, by which one thinks, "I belong to this nation," "I
belong to this group," "I belong to that group," and so on. Each of us has his own ideas, and we are becoming
increasingly involved, individually, socially, communally and nationally, in the complexities of karmanubandha,
sinful activities. For the maintenance of the body, men are killing so many other bodies and becoming implicated
in karmanubandha. Therefore Srila Jiva Gosvami says that tanu-mani, those in the bodily concept of life, are papi,
sinful persons. For such sinful persons, the ultimate destination is the darkest region of hellish life (ganta tamo
'ndham). In particular, a person who wants to maintain his body by killing animals is most sinful and cannot
understand the value of spiritual life. In Bhagavad-gita (16.19-20) the Lord says:
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
asurim yonim apanna
mudha janmani janmani
mam aprapyaiva kaunteya
tato yanty adhamam gatim
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of
material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth among the species of demoniac
life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence." A
human being is meant to understand the value of human life, which is a boon obtained after many, many births.
Therefore one must free oneself from tanu-mani, the bodily concept of life, and realize the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.

asinah--while sitting comfortably in his sitting room or on the throne; samvisan--or lying on his bed; tisthan--or
staying anywhere; bhunjanah--while eating; paryatan--while walking or moving; mahim--on the ground, going
hither and thither; cintayanah--always inimically thinking of; hrsikesam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
controller of everything; apasyat--observed; tat-mayam--consisting of Him (Krsna), and nothing more; jagat--the
entire world.
While sitting on his throne or in his sitting room, while lying on his bed, or, indeed, while situated anywhere,
and while eating, sleeping or walking, Kamsa saw only his enemy, the Supreme Lord, Hrsikesa. In other words, by
thinking of his all-pervading enemy, Kamsa became unfavorably Krsna conscious.
Srila Rupa Gosvami has described the finest pattern of devotional service as anukulyena krsnanusilanam, or
cultivating Krsna consciousness favorably. Kamsa, of course, was also Krsna conscious, but because he regarded
Krsna as his enemy, even though he was fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness, his Krsna consciousness was not
favorable for his existence. Krsna consciousness, favorably cultivated, makes one completely happy, so much so
that a Krsna conscious person does not consider kaivalya-sukham, or merging into the existence of Krsna, to be a
great gain. Kaivalyam narakayate. For a Krsna conscious person, even merging into the existence of Krsna, or
Brahman, as impersonalists aspire to do, is uncomfortable. Kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate.
Karmis hanker to be promoted to the heavenly planets, but a Krsna conscious person considers such promotion a
will-o'-the-wisp, good for nothing. Durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate. Yogis try to control
their senses and thus become happy, but a Krsna conscious person neglects the methods of yoga. He is
unconcerned with the greatest of enemies, the senses, which are compared to snakes. For a Krsna conscious person
who is cultivating Krsna consciousness favorably, the happiness conceived by the karmis, jnanis and yogis is
treated as less than a fig. Kamsa, however, because of cultivating Krsna consciousness in a different way--that is,
inimically--was uncomfortable in all the affairs of his life; whether sitting, sleeping, walking or eating, he was
always in danger. This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. A nondevotee or atheist also
cultivates God consciousness--by trying to avoid God in everything. For example, so-called scientists who want to
create life by a combination of chemicals regard the external, material elements as supreme. Such scientists do not
like the idea that life is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita (mamaivamso jivaloke
jiva-bhutah), the living entities do not arise from a combination of material elements, such as earth, water, air
and fire, but are separated portions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can understand the position of
the living entity as a separated portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by studying the nature of the living
entity one can understand the nature of the Supreme Godhead, since the living entity is a fragmental sample of the
Godhead. But because atheists are not interested in God consciousness, they try to be happy by cultivating Krsna
consciousness in various unfavorable ways.
Although Kamsa was always absorbed in thoughts of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was not
happy. A devotee, however, whether sitting on a throne or beneath a tree, is always happy. Srila Rupa Gosvami
resigned from office as a government minister to sit beneath a tree, yet he was happy. Tyaktva turnam asesamandalapati-
srenim sada tucchavat (Sad-gosvamy-astaka 4). He did not care for his comfortable position as
minister; he was happy even beneath a tree in Vrndavana, favorably serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. For a nondevotee, the world is full of problems,
whereas for a devotee the entire world is full of happiness.
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
(Caitanya-candramrta 95)
This comfortable position of a devotee can be established by the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Yasmin
sthito na duhkhena gurunapi vicalyate (Bg. 6.22). Even when a devotee is superficially put into great difficulty, he
is never disturbed.

Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, accompanied by great sages like Narada, Devala and Vyasa and by other demigods
like Indra, Candra and Varuna, invisibly approached the room of Devaki, where they all joined in offering their
respectful obeisances and prayers to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can bestow blessings upon
everyone.
Dvau bhuta-sargau loke 'smin daiva asura eva ca (Padma Purana). There are two classes of men--the daivas and
the asuras--and there is a great difference between them. Kamsa, being an asura, was always planning how to kill
the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His mother, Devaki. Thus he was also Krsna conscious. But devotees are
Krsna conscious favorably (visnu-bhaktah smrto daivah). Brahma is so powerful that he is in charge of creating an
entire universe, yet he personally came to receive the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhava, Lord Siva, is always
jubilant in chanting the holy name of the Lord. And what to speak of Narada? Narada-muni, bajaya vina, radhikaramana-
name. Narada Muni is always chanting the glories of the Lord, and his engagement is to travel all over the
universe and find a devotee or make someone a devotee. Even a hunter was made a devotee by the grace of Narada.
Srila Sanatana Gosvami, in his Tosani, says that the word narada-adibhih means that Narada and the demigods
were accompanied by other saintly persons, like Sanaka and Sanatana, all of whom came to congratulate or
welcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even though Kamsa was planning to kill Devaki, he too awaited the
arrival of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (pratiksams taj janma).

satyasya yonim nihitam ca satye
satyasya satyam rta-satya-netram
satyatmakam tvam saranam prapannah
satya-vratam--the Personality of Godhead, who never deviates from His vow
).
To honor this vow, the Lord appeared.
*; satya-param--who is the Absolute Truth (as stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, satyam param
dhimahi); tri-satyam--He is always present as the Absolute Truth, before the creation of this cosmic manifestation,
during its maintenance, and even after its annihilation; satyasya--of all relative truths, which are emanations from
the Absolute Truth, Krsna; yonim--t;he cause; nihitam--entered). Therefore He is called antaryami, the inner force.
*; ca--and; satye--in the factors that create this material world (namely, the five elements--earth, water, fire, air and
ether); satyasya--of all that is accepted as the truth; satyam--the Lord is the original truth; rta-satya-netram--He is
the origin of whatever truth is pleasing (sunetram); satya-atmakam--everything pertaining to the Lord is truth (saccid-
ananda: His body is truth, His knowledge is truth, and His pleasure is truth); tvam--unto you, O Lord;
saranam--offering our full surrender; prapannah--we are completely under Your protection.
The demigods prayed: O Lord, You never deviate from Your vow, which is always perfect because whatever You
decide is perfectly correct and cannot be stopped by anyone. Being present in the three phases of cosmic
manifestation--creation, maintenance and annihilation--You are the Supreme Truth. Indeed, unless one is
completely truthful, one cannot achieve Your favor, which therefore cannot be achieved by hypocrites. You are the
active principle, the real truth, in all the ingredients of creation, and therefore you are known as antaryami, the
inner force. You are equal to everyone, and Your instructions apply for everyone, for all time. You are the
beginning of all truth. Therefore, offering our obeisances, we surrender unto You. Kindly give us protection.
The demigods or devotees know perfectly well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true substance,
whether within this material world or in the spiritual world. Srimad-Bhagavatam begins, therefore, with the words
om namo bhagavate vasudevaya. .. satyam param dhimahi. Vasudeva, Krsna, is the param satyam, the Supreme
Truth. The Supreme Truth can be approached or understood by the supreme method, as declared by the Supreme
Truth: bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg. 18.55). Bhakti, devotional service, is the only way to
understand the Absolute Truth. For protection, therefore, the demigods surrender to the Supreme Truth, not to the
relative truth. There are persons who worship various demigods, but the Supreme Truth, Krsna, declares in
Bhagavad-gita (7.23), antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: "Men of small intelligence worship the
demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." Worship of demigods may be useful for a limited time, but
the result is antavat, perishable. This material world is impermanent, the demigods are impermanent, and the
benedictions derived from the demigods are also impermanent, whereas the living entity is eternal (nityo nityanam
cetanas cetananam). Every living entity, therefore, must search for eternal happiness, not temporary happiness. The
words satyam param dhimahi indicate that one should search for the Absolute Truth, not the relative truth.
While offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nrsimhadeva, Prahlada Maharaja said:
balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha
nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh
Generally it is understood that the protectors for a child are his parents, but this is not actually the fact. The real
protector is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas
tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam
(Bhag. 7.9.19)
If neglected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a child, despite the presence of his parents, will suffer, and a
diseased person, despite all medical help, will die. In this material world, where there is a struggle for existence,
men have invented many means for protection, but these are useless if the Supreme Personality of Godhead rejects
them. Therefore the demigods purposefully say, satyatmakam tvam saranam prapannah: "Real protection can be
obtained from You, O Lord, and therefore we surrender unto You,"
The Lord demands that one surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja), and He
further says:
sakrd eva prapanno yas
tavasmiti ca yacate
abhayam sarvada tasmai
dadamy etad vratam mama
"If one surrenders unto Me sincerely, saying, 'My Lord, from this day I am fully surrendered unto You,' I always
give him protection. That is My vow." (Ramayana, Yuddha-kanda 18.33) The demigods offered their prayers to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead because He had now appeared in the womb of His devotee Devaki to protect all
the devotees harassed by Kamsa and his lieutenants. Thus the Lord acts as satyavrata. The protection given by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to the protection given by the demigods. It is said that
Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Siva, but when Lord Ramacandra went to kill him, Lord Siva could not give
him protection.
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, accompanied by great sages like Narada and followed by many other demigods, had
now invisibly appeared in the house of Kamsa. They began to pray for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
select prayers which are very pleasing to the devotees and which award fulfillment of devotional desires. The first
words they spoke acclaimed that the Lord is true to His vow. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, Krsna descends upon
this material world just to protect the pious and destroy the impious. That is His vow. The demigods could
understand that the Lord had taken His residence within the womb of Devaki to fulfill this vow. They were very
glad that the Lord was appearing to fulfill His mission, and they addressed Him as satyam param, or the Supreme
Absolute Truth.
Everyone is searching after the truth. That is the philosophical way of life. The demigods give information that
the Supreme Absolute Truth is Krsna. One who becomes fully Krsna conscious can attain the Absolute Truth.
Krsna is the Absolute Truth. Relative truth is not truth in all the three phases of eternal time. Time is divided into
past, present and future. Krsna is Truth always, past, present and future. In the material world, everything is being
controlled by supreme time, in the course of past, present and future. But before the creation, Krsna was existing,
and when there is creation, everything is resting in Krsna, and when this creation is finished, Krsna will remain.
Therefore, He is Absolute Truth in all circumstances, If there is any truth within this material world, it emanates
from the Supreme Truth, Krsna. If there is any opulence within this material world, the cause of the opulence is
Krsna. If there is any reputation within this material world, the cause of the reputation is Krsna. If there is any
strength within this material world, the cause of such strength is Krsna. If there is any wisdom and education
within this material world, the cause of such wisdom and education is Krsna. Therefore Krsna is the source of all
relative truths.
Devotees, therefore, following in the footsteps of Lord Brahma, pray, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami,
worshiping the adi-purusa, the supreme truth, Govinda. Everything, everywhere, is performed in terms of three
principles, jnana-bala-kriya--knowledge, strength and activity. In every field, if there is not full knowledge, full
strength and full activity, an endeavor is never successful. Therefore, if one wants success in everything, one must
be backed by these three principles. In the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) there is this statement about the
Supreme Personality of Godhead:
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to do anything personally, for He has such potencies that
anything He wants done will be done perfectly well through the control of material nature (svabhaviki jnana-balakriya
ca). Similarly, those who are engaged in the service of the Lord are not meant to struggle for existence. The
devotees who are fully engaged in spreading the Krsna consciousness movement, more than ten thousand men and
women all over the world, have no steady or permanent occupation, yet we actually see that they are maintained
very opulently. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.22):
ananyas cintayanto mam
ye janah paryupasate
tesam nityabhiyuktanam
yoga-ksemam vahamy aham
"For those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form, I carry to them what they lack
and preserve what they have." The devotees have no anxiety over what will happen next, where they will stay or
what they will eat, for everything is maintained and supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has
promised, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never
perishes." (Bg. 9.31) From all angles of vision, therefore, in all circumstances, if one fully surrenders unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of one's struggling for existence. In this connection, the
commentary by Sripada Madhvacarya, who quotes from the Tantra-bhagavata, is very meaningful:
sac-chadba uttamam bruyad
anandantiti vai vadet
yetijnanam samuddistam
purnananda-drsis tatah
attrtvac ca tada danat
satyattya cocyate vibhuh
Explaining the words satyasya yonim, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that Krsna is the avatari, the
origin of all incarnations. All incarnations are the Absolute Truth, yet the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna is
the origin of all incarnations. Diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya dipayate (Brahma-samhita 5.46). There may
be many lamps, all equal in power, yet there is a first lamp, a second lamp, a third lamp and so on. Similarly, there
are many incarnations, who are compared to lamps, but the first lamp, the original Personality of Godhead, is
Krsna. Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami.
The demigods must offer worship in obedience to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but one might argue that
since the Supreme Godhead was within the womb of Devaki, He was also coming in a material body. Why then
should He be worshiped? Why should one make a distinction between an ordinary living entity and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead? These questions are answered in the following verses.

in this body we are subject to material happiness and distress, which result from karma; tri-mulah--having
three roots, the three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance), upon which the body is created; catuhrasah--
four rasas, or tastes; panca-vidhah--consisting of five senses for acquiring knowledge (the eyes, ears, nose,
tongue and touch); sat-atma--six circumstances (lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and thirst); saptatvak--
having seven coverings (skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen); asta-vitapah--eight branches (the
five gross elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--and also the mind, intelligence and ego); nava-aksah--nine
holes; dasa-chadi--ten kinds of life air, resembling the leaves of a tree; dvi-khagah--two birds (the individual soul
and the Supersoul); hi--indeed; adi-vrksah --this is the original tree or construction of the material body, whether
individual or universal.
The body [the total body and the individual body are of the same composition] may figuratively be called "the
original tree." From this tree, which fully depends on the ground of material nature, come two kinds of fruit--the
enjoyment of happiness and the suffering of distress. The cause of the tree, forming its three roots, is association
with the three modes of material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance. The fruits of bodily happiness have four
tastes--religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation--which are experienced through five
senses for acquiring knowledge in the midst of six circumstances: lamentation, illusion, old age, death, hunger and
thirst. The seven layers of bark covering the tree are skin, blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen, and the
eight branches of the tree are the five gross and three subtle elements--earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,
intelligence and false ego. The tree of the body has nine hollows--the eyes, the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the
rectum and the genitals--and ten leaves, the ten airs passing through the body. In this tree of the body there are two
birds: one is the individual soul, and the other is the Supersoul.
This material world is composed of five principal elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--all of which are
emanations from Krsna. Although materialistic scientists may accept these five primary elements as the cause of the
material manifestation, these elements in their gross and subtle states are produced by Krsna, whose marginal
potency also produces the living entities working within this material world. The Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita
clearly states that the entire cosmic manifestation is a combination of two of Krsna's energies--the superior energy
and the inferior energy. The living entities are the superior energy, and the inanimate material elements are His
inferior energy. In the dormant stage, everything rests in Krsna.
Material scientists cannot give such a thorough analysis of the material structure of the body. The analysis of the
material scientists concerns itself only with inanimate matter, but this is inadequate because the living entity is
completely separate from the material bodily structure. In Bhagavad-gita (7.5) the Lord says:
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all the
living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Although the material
elements emanate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, they are separated elements and are sustained
by the living elements.
As indicated by the word dvi-khagah, the living elements within the body resemble two birds in a tree. Kha
means "sky," and ga means "one who flies." Thus the word dvi-khagah refers to birds. In the tree of the body there
are two birds, or two living elements, and they are always different. In Bhagavad-gita (13.3), the Lord says, ksetra
jnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: "O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the
knower in all bodies." The ksetra jna, the owner of the body, is also called the khaga, the living entity. Within the
body there are two such ksetra jnas--the individual soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul is the owner of his
individual body, but the Supersoul is present within the bodies of all living entities. Such a thorough analysis and
understanding of the bodily structure cannot be obtained anywhere but in the Vedic literature.
When two birds enter a tree, one may foolishly think that the birds become one or merge with the tree, but
actually they do not. Rather, each bird keeps its individual identity. Similarly, the individual soul and the Supersoul
do not become one, nor do they merge with matter. The living entity lives close to matter, but this does not mean
that he merges or mixes with it (asango hy ayam purusah), although material scientists mistakenly see the organic
and inorganic, or animate and inanimate, to be mixed.
Vedic knowledge has been kept imprisoned or concealed, but every human being needs to understand it in truth.
The modern civilization of ignorance is simply engaged in analyzing the body, and thus people come to the
erroneous conclusion that the living force within the body is generated under certain material conditions. People
have no information of the soul, but this verse gives the perfect explanation that there are two living forces (dvikhaga):
the individual soul and the Supersoul. The Supersoul is present in every body (isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati), whereas the individual soul is situated only in his own body (dehi) and is transmigrating
from one body to another.

tvam eka evasya satah prasutis

tvam--You (O Lord); ekah--being one without a second, You are everything; eva--indeed; asya satah--of this
cosmic manifestation now visible; prasutih--the original source; tvam--Your Lordship; sannidhanam--the
conservation of all such energy when everything is annihilated; tvam--Your Lordship; anugrahah ca--and the
maintainer; tvat-mayaya--by Your illusory, external energy; samvrta-cetasah--those whose intelligence is covered by
such illusory energy; tvam--unto You; pasyanti--observe; nana--many varieties; na--not; vipascitah--learned
scholars or devotees; ye--who are.
The efficient cause of this material world, manifested with its many varieties as the original tree, is You, O Lord.
You are also the maintainer of this material world, and after annihilation You are the one in whom everything is
conserved. Those who are covered by Your external energy cannot see You behind this manifestation, but theirs is
not the vision of learned devotees.
Various demigods, beginning from Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and even Visnu, are supposed to be the creator,
maintainer and annihilator of this material world, but actually they are not. The fact is that everything is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, manifested in varieties of energy. Ekam evadvitiyam brahma. There is no second
existence. Those who are truly vipascit, learned, are those who have reached the platform of understanding and
observing the Supreme Personality of Godhead in any condition of life. premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti (Brahma-samhita 5.38). Learned devotees accept even conditions of distress as
representing the presence of the Supreme Lord. When a devotee is in distress, he sees that the Lord has appeared as
distress just to relieve or purify the devotee from the contamination of the material world. While one is within this
material world, one is in various conditions, and therefore a devotee sees a condition of distress as but another
feature of the Lord. Tat te'nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag. 10.14.8). A devotee, therefore, regards distress as a
great favor of the Lord because he understands that he is being cleansed of contamination. Tesam aham
samuddharta mrtyu-samsara-sagarat (Bg. 12.7). The appearance of distress is a negative process intended to give
the devotee relief from this material world, which is called mrtyu-samsara, or the constant repetition of birth and
death. To save a surrendered soul from repeated birth and death, the Lord purifies him of contamination by
offering him a little distress. This cannot be understood by a nondevotee, but a devotee can see this because he is
vipascit, or learned. A nondevotee, therefore, is perturbed in distress, but a devotee welcomes distress as another
feature of the Lord. Sarvam khalv idam brahma. A devotee can actually see that there is only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and no second entity. Ekam evadvitiyam. There is only the Lord, who presents Himself in
different energies.
Persons who are not in real knowledge think that Brahma is the creator, Visnu the maintainer and Siva the
annihilator and that the different demigods are intended to fulfill diverse purposes. Thus they create diverse
purposes and worship various demigods to have these purposes fulfilled (kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante
'nya-devatah). A devotee, however, knows that these various demigods are but different parts of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and that these parts need not be worshiped. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devata bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered
without true understanding." There is no need to worship the demigods, for this is avidhi, not in order. Simply by
surrendering oneself at the lotus feet of Krsna, one can completely discharge one's duties; there is no need to
worship various deities or demigods. These various divinities are observed by the mudhas, fools, who are
bewildered by the three modes of material nature (tribhir gunamayair bhavair ebhih sarvam idam jagat). Such fools
cannot understand that the real source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (mohitam nabhijanati
mam ebhyah param avyayam). Not being disturbed by the Lord's various features, one should concentrate upon
and worship the Supreme Lord (mam ekam saranam vraja). This should be the guiding principle of one's life.

incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead all function differently, but their main purpose is paritranaya

powerful original existence or which is executed by mahajanas; kurvanti--they make; govatsa-padam--like the
hoofprint of a calf; bhava-abdhim--the great ocean of nescience.
O lotus-eyed Lord, by concentrating one's meditation on Your lotus feet, which are the reservoir of all existence,
and by accepting those lotus feet as the boat by which to cross the ocean of nescience, one follows in the footsteps
of mahajanas [great saints, sages and devotees]. By this simple process, one can cross the ocean of nescience as
easily as one steps over the hoofprint of a calf.
The true mission in life is to cross the ocean of nescience, of repeated birth and death. Those in the darkness of
ignorance, however, do not know this mission. Instead, being carried away by the waves of material nature
(prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah), they are undergoing the tribulations of mrtyu-samsara-vartmani,
repeated birth and death. But persons who have achieved knowledge by the association of devotees follow the
mahajanas (mahat-krtena). Such a person always concentrates his mind upon the lotus feet of the Lord and
executes one or more of the nine varieties of devotional service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam padasevanam).
Simply by this process, one can cross the insurmountable ocean of nescience.
Devotional service is powerful in any form. Sri-visnoh sravane pariksid abhavad vaiyasakih kirtane (Bhaktirasamrta-
sindhu 1.2.265). According to this verse, Maharaja Pariksit became liberated by fully concentrating his
mind on hearing the Lord's holy name, attributes and pastimes. Similarly, Sukadeva Gosvami simply glorified the
Lord, and by speaking on the subject matters of Krsna that constitute the entire Srimad-Bhagavatam, he too was
liberated. One may also be liberated simply by sakhya, friendly behavior with the Lord. Such is the power of
devotional service, as we learn from the examples set by the Lord's many pure devotees.
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
(Bhag. 6.3.20)
We have to follow in the footsteps of such devotees, for by this one easy process one can cross the great ocean of
nescience just as one might cross a small hole created by the hoof of a calf.
Here the Lord is described as ambujaksa, or lotus-eyed. By seeing the eyes of the Lord, which are compared to
lotus flowers, one becomes so satisfied that one does not want to turn his eyes to anything else. Simply by seeing
the transcendental form of the Lord, a devotee is at once fully absorbed in the Lord in his heart. This absorption is
called samadhi. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah (Bhag. 12.13.1). A yogi is fully absorbed
in thoughts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for he has no other business than to think of the Lord always
within the heart. It is also said:
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation
and is famous as Murari, the enemy of the demon Mura, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained
in a calf's hoofprint. His goal is param padam, or Vaikuntha, the place where there are no material miseries, not the
place where there is danger at every step." (Bhag. 10.14.58) This process is recommended here by authorities like
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva (svayambhur naradah sambhuh), and therefore we must take to this process in order to
transcend nescience. This is very easy, but we must follow in the footsteps of great personalities, and then success
will be possible.
In regard to the word mahat-krtena, it is also significant that the process shown by great devotees is not only for
them but also for others. If things are made easy, this affords facility for the person who has made them easy and
also for others who follow the same principles. The process recommended in this verse for crossing the ocean of
nescience is easy not only for the devotee but also for common persons who follow the devotee (mahajano yena
gatah sa panthah).

O Lord, who resemble the shining sun, You are always ready to fulfill the desire of Your devotee, and therefore
You are known as a desire tree [vancha-kalpataru]. When acaryas completely take shelter under Your lotus feet in
order to cross the fierce ocean of nescience, they leave behind on earth the method by which they cross, and
because You are very merciful to Your other devotees, You accept this method to help them.
This statement reveals how the merciful acaryas and the merciful Supreme Personality of Godhead together help
the serious devotee who wants to return home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in His teachings to
Rupa Gosvami, said:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
One can achieve the seed of bhakti-lata, devotional service, by the mercy of guru and Krsna. The duty of the guru
is to find the means, according to the time, the circumstances and the candidate, by which one can be induced to
render devotional service, which Krsna accepts from a candidate who wants to be successful in going back home,
back to Godhead. After wandering throughout the universe, a fortunate person within this material world seeks
shelter of such a guru, or acarya, who trains the devotee in the suitable ways to render service according to the
circumstances so that the Supreme Personality of Godhead will accept the service. This makes it easier for the
candidate to reach the ultimate destination. The acarya's duty, therefore, is to find the means by which devotees
may render service according to references from sastra. Rupa Gosvami, for example, in order to help subsequent
devotees, published such devotional books as Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu. Thus it is the duty of the acarya to publish
books that will help future candidates take up the method of service and become eligible to return home, back to
Godhead, by the mercy of the Lord. In our Krsna consciousness movement, this same path is being prescribed and
followed. Thus the devotees have been advised to refrain from four sinful activities--illicit sex, intoxication, meateating
and gambling--and to chant sixteen rounds a day. These are bona fide instructions. Because in the Western
countries constant chanting is not possible, one should not artificially imitate Haridasa Thakura, but should follow
this method. Krsna will accept a devotee who strictly follows the regulative principles and the method prescribed
in the various books and literatures published by the authorities. The acarya gives the suitable method for crossing
the ocean of nescience by accepting the boat of the Lord's lotus feet, and if this method is strictly followed, the
followers will ultimately reach the destination, by the grace of the Lord. This method is called acarya-sampradaya.
It is therefore said, sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah (Padma Purana). The acarya-sampradaya is
strictly bona fide. Therefore one must accept the acarya-sampradaya; otherwise one's endeavor will be futile. Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings:
tandera carana sevi bhakta sane vasa
janame janame haya, ei abhilasa
One must worship the lotus feet of the acarya and live within the society of devotees. Then one's endeavor to
cross over nescience will surely be successful.

[Someone may say that aside from devotees, who always seek shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, there are those who
are not devotees but who have accepted different processes for attaining salvation. What happens to them? In
answer to this question, Lord Brahma and the other demigods said:] O lotus-eyed Lord, although nondevotees who
accept severe austerities and penances to achieve the highest position may think themselves liberated, their
intelligence is impure. They fall down from their position of imagined superiority because they have no regard for
Your lotus feet.
Aside from devotees, there are many others, nondevotees, known as karmis, jnanis or yogis, philanthropists,
altruists, politicians, impersonalists and voidists. There are many varieties of nondevotees who have their
respective ways of liberation, but simply because they do not know the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, although
they falsely think that they have been liberated and elevated to the highest position, they fall down. As clearly
stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.3):
asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa
aprapya mam nivartante
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani
"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to
birth and death in this material world." It doesn't matter whether one is a karmi, jnani, yogi, philanthropist,
politician or whatever; if one has no love for the lotus feet of the Lord, one falls down. That is the verdict given by
Lord brahma in this verse.
There are persons who advocate accepting any process and who say that whatever process one accepts will lead
to the same goal, but that is refuted in this verse, where such persons are referred to as vimukta-maninah,
signifying that although they think they have attained the highest perfection, in fact they have not. In the present
day, big, big politicians all over the world think that by scheming they can occupy the highest political post, that of
president or prime minister, but we actually see that even in this life such big prime ministers, presidents and other
politicians, because of being nondevotees, fall down (patanty adhah). To become president or prime minister is not
easy; one must work very hard (aruhya krcchrena) to achieve the post. And even though one may reach his goal, at
any moment one may be kicked down by material nature. In human society there have been many instances in
which great, exalted politicians have fallen from government and become lost in historical oblivion. The cause of
this is avisuddha-buddhayah: their intelligence is impure. The sastra says, na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum
(Bhag. 7.5.31). One achieves the perfection of life by becoming a devotee of Visnu, but people do not know this.
Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (12.5), kleso 'dhikataras tesam avyaktasakta-cetasam. Persons who do not
ultimately accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead and take to devotional service, but who instead are attached
to impersonalism and voidism, must undergo great labor to achieve their goals.
sreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho
klisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
(Bhag. 10.14.4)
To achieve understanding, such persons work very hard and undergo severe austerities, but their hard labor and
austerities themselves are their only achievement, for they do not actually achieve the real goal of life.
Dhruva Maharaja at first wanted to achieve the greatest material kingdom and greater material possessions than
his father, but when he was actually favored by the Lord, who appeared before him to give him the benediction he
desired, Dhruva Maharaja refused it, saying, svamin krtartho'smi varam na yace: "Now I am fully satisfied. I do not
want any material benediction." (Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya 7.28) This is the perfection of life. Yam labdhva caparam
labham manyate nadhikam tatah (Bg. 6.22). If one achieves the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet, one is fully satisfied
and does not need to ask for any material benediction.
At night, no one can see a lotus, for lotuses blossom only during the daytime. Therefore the word aravindaksa is
significant. One who is not captivated by the lotus eyes or transcendental form of the Supreme Lord is in darkness,
exactly like one who cannot see a lotus. One who has not come to the point of seeing the lotus eyes and
transcendental form of Syamasundara is a failure. premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu
vilokayanti. Those who are attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in love always see the Lord's lotus eyes
and lotus feet, whereas others cannot see the Lord's beauty and are therefore classified as anadrta-yusmadanghrayah,
or neglectful of the Lord's personal form. Those who neglect the Lord's form are surely failures on every
path in life, but if one develops even a little love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is liberated without
difficulty (svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat). Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead
recommends in Bhagavad-gita (9.34), man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru: "Simply think of
Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer some slight homage to Me." Simply by this process, one is
guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, and thus attain the highest perfection. The Lord further affirms in
Bhagavad-gita (18.54-55):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He
never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains
pure devotional service unto Me. One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.
And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of
God."

O Madhava, Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord of the goddess of fortune, if devotees completely in love with
You sometimes fall from the path of devotion, they do not fall like nondevotees, for You still protect them. Thus
they fearlessly traverse the heads of their opponents and continue to progress in devotional service.
Devotees generally do not fall down, but if circumstantially they do, the Lord, because of their strong attachment
to Him, gives them protection in all circumstances. Thus even if devotees fall down, they are still strong enough to
traverse the heads of their enemies. We have actually seen that our Krsna consciousness movement has many
opponents, such as the "deprogrammers," who instituted a strong legal case against the devotees. We thought that
this case would take a long time to settle, but because the devotees were protected by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, we unexpectedly won the case in one day. Thus a case that was expected to continue for years was
settled in a day because of the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has promised in Bhagavadgita
(9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never
perishes." In history there are many instances of devotees like Citraketu, Indradyumna and Maharaja Bharata who
circumstantially fell down but were still protected. Maharaja Bharata, for example, because of his attachment to a
deer, thought of the deer at the time of death, and therefore in his next life he became a deer (yam yam vapi smaran
bhavam tyajaty ante kalevaram). Because of protection by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, the deer
remembered his relationship with the Lord and next took birth in a good brahminical family and performed
devotional service (sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate). Similarly, Citraketu fell down and became a
demon, Vrtrasura, but he too was protected. Thus even if one falls down from the path of bhakti-yoga, one is
ultimately saved. If a devotee is strongly situated in devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has
promised to protect him (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati). But even if a devotee circumstantially
falls down, he is protected by Madhava.
The word Madhava is significant. Ma, mother Laksmi, the mother of all opulences, is always with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and if a devotee is in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all the opulences of
the Lord are ready to help him.
yatra yogesvarah krsno
yatra partho dhanur-dharah
tatra srir vijayo bhutir
dhruva nitir matir mama
(Bg. 18.78)
Wherever there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and His devotee Arjuna, Partha, there is victory,
opulence, extraordinary power and morality. The opulences of a devotee are not a result of karma-kanda-vicara. A
devotee is always protected by all of the Supreme Lord's opulences, of which no one can deprive him (tesam
nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham). Thus a devotee cannot be defeated by any opponents. A devotee,
therefore, should not deviate knowingly from the path of devotion. The adherent devotee is assured all protection
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

by ritualistic ceremonies according to the directions of the Vedas; yoga--by practice of devotion; tapah--by
austerities; samadhibhih--by becoming absorbed in transcendental existence; tava--Your; arhanam--worship; yena--
by such activities; janah--human society; samihate--offers (its obligation unto You).
O Lord, during the time of maintenance You manifest several incarnations, all with transcendental bodies,
beyond the material modes of nature. When You appear in this way, You bestow all good fortune upon the living
entities by teaching them to perform Vedic activities such as ritualistic ceremonies, mystic yoga, austerities,
penances, and ultimately samadhi, ecstatic absorption in thoughts of You. Thus You are worshiped by the Vedic
principles.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.3), yajna-dana-tapah-karma na tyajyam: the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, charity,
austerity and all such prescribed duties are never to be given up. Yajno danam tapas caiva pavanani manisinam
(18.5): even one who is very much advanced in spiritual realization must still execute the Vedic principles. Even in
the lowest stage, the karmis are advised to work for the sake of the Lord.
yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra
loko 'yam karma-bandhanah
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." (Bg.
3.9) The words yajnarthat karmanah indicate that while performing all kinds of duties, one should remember that
these duties should be performed to satisfy the Supreme Lord (sva-karmana tam abhyarcya). According to Vedic
principles, there must be divisions of human society (catur-varnyam maya srstam). There should be brahmanas,
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, and everyone should learn to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tam
abhyarcya). This is real human society, and without this system we are left with animal society.
The modern activities of human society are described in Srimad-Bhagavatam as the activities of go-khara, cows
and asses (sa eva go-kharah). Everyone is acting in a bodily concept of life involving society, friendship and love
for the improvement of economic and political conditions, and thus all activities are enacted in ignorance. The
Supreme Personality therefore comes to teach us how to act according to the Vedic principles. In this age of Kali,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and preached that in this age the Vedic
activities cannot be systematically performed because people are so fallen. He gave this recommendation from the
sastras:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There
is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore
teaching people all over the world how to chant the Hare Krsna mantra, and this has proved very much effective in
all places at all times. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in order to teach us Vedic principles intended
for understanding Him (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). We should always know that when Krsna and Lord
Caitanya appeared, They appeared in suddha-sattva bodies. One should not mistake the body of Krsna or Caitanya
Mahaprabhu to be a material body like ours, for Krsna and Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared as needed for the
benefit of the entire human society. Out of causeless mercy, the Lord appears in different ages in His original
suddha-sattva transcendental body to elevate human society to the spiritual platform upon which they can truly
benefit. Unfortunately, modern politicians and other leaders stress the bodily comforts of life (yasyatma-buddhih
kunape tri-dhatuke) and concentrate on the activities of this ism and that ism, which they describe in different
kinds of flowery language. Essentially such activities are the activities of animals (sa eva go-kharah). We should
learn how to act from Bhagavad-gita, which explains everything for human understanding. Thus we can become
happy even in this age of Kali.

O Lord, cause of all causes, if Your transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature, one could
not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by Your presence can one understand the
transcendental nature of Your Lordship, who are the controller of material nature. Your transcendental nature is
very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of Your transcendental form.
It is said, traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna. Unless one is situated in transcendence, one cannot
understand the transcendental nature of the Lord. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.29):
athapi te deva padambuja-dvayaprasada-
lesanugrhita eva hi
janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno
na canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan
Only by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can one understand Him. Those who are in the modes
of material nature, although speculating for thousands of years, cannot understand Him. The Lord has innumerable
forms (ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan), and unless these forms, such as Lord Ramacandra, Nrsimhadeva,
Krsna and Balarama, were transcendental, how could they be worshiped by devotees since time immemorial?
Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg. 18.55). Devotees who awaken their transcendental nature
in the presence of the Lord and who follow the rules and regulations of devotional service can understand Lord
Krsna, Lord Ramacandra and other incarnations, who are not of this material world but who come from the
spiritual world for the benefit of people in general. If one does not take to this process, one imagines or
manufactures some form of God according to material qualities and can never awaken a real understanding of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah signify that unless
one worships the Lord according to the regulative devotional principles, one cannot awaken the transcendental
nature. Deity worship, even in the absence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, awakens the transcendental
nature of the devotee, who thus becomes increasingly attached to the Lord's lotus feet.
The appearance of Krsna is the answer to all imaginative iconography of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Everyone imagines the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to his mode of material nature. In
the Brahma-samhita it is said that the Lord is the oldest person. Therefore a section of religionists imagine that God
must be very old, and therefore they depict a form of the Lord like a very old man. But in the same Brahmasamhita,
that is contradicted; although He is the oldest of all living entities, He has His eternal form as a fresh
youth. The exact words used in this connection in the Srimad-Bhagavatam are vijnanam ajnana-bhidapamarjanam.
Vijnana means transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Personality; vijnana is also experienced knowledge.
Transcendental knowledge has to be accepted by the descending process of disciplic succession as Brahma presents
the knowledge of Krsna in the Brahma-samhita. Brahma-samhita is vijnana as realized by Brahma's transcendental
experience, and in that way he presented the form and the pastimes of Krsna in the transcendental abode. Ajnanabhida
means "that which can match all kinds of speculation." In ignorance, people are imagining the form of the
Lord; sometimes He has no form and sometimes He has form, according to their different imaginations. But the
presentation of Krsna in the Brahma-samhita is vijnana--scientific, experienced knowledge given by Lord Brahma
and accepted by Lord Caitanya. There is no doubt about it. Sri Krsna's form, Sri Krsna's flute, Krsna's color--
everything is reality. Here it is said that this vijnanam is always defeating all kinds of speculative knowledge.
"Therefore," the demigods prayed, "without Your appearing as Krsna, as You are, neither ajnana-bhida (the
nescience of speculative knowledge) nor vijnanam would be realized. Ajnana-bhidapamarjanam--by Your
appearance the speculative knowledge of ignorance will be vanquished, and the real, experienced knowledge of
authorities like Lord Brahma will be established. Men influenced by the three modes of material nature imagine
their own God according to the modes of material nature. In this way God is presented in various ways, but Your
appearance will establish what the real form of God is."
The highest blunder committed by the impersonalist is to think that when the incarnation of God comes, He
accepts a form of matter in the mode of goodness. Actually the form of Krsna or Narayana is transcendental to any
material idea. Even the greatest impersonalist, Sankaracarya, has admitted, narayanah paro 'vyaktat: the material
creation is caused by the avyakta, the impersonal manifestation of matter or the nonphenomenal total reservoir of
matter, and Krsna is transcendental to that material conception. This is expressed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam as
suddha-sattva, or transcendental. The Lord does not belong to the material mode of goodness, for He is above the
position of material goodness. He belongs to the transcendental, eternal status of bliss and knowledge.
"Dear Lord," the demigods prayed, "when You appear in Your different incarnations, You take different names
and forms according to different situations. Lord Krsna is Your name because You are all-attractive; You are called
Syamasundara because of Your transcendental beauty. Syama means blackish, yet they say that You are more
beautiful than thousands of cupids. Kandarpa-koti-kamaniya. Although You appear in a color which is compared to
that of a blackish cloud, You are the transcendental Absolute, and therefore Your beauty is many, many times more
attractive than the delicate body of Cupid. Sometimes You are called Giridhari because You lifted the hill known as
Govardhana. You are sometimes called Nanda-nandana or Vasudeva or Devaki-nandana because You appear as the
son of Maharaja Nanda or Devaki or Vasudeva. Impersonalists think that Your many names or forms are according
to a particular type of work and quality because they accept You from the position of a material observer.
"Our dear Lord, the way of understanding is not to study Your absolute nature, form and activities by mental
speculation. One must engage himself in devotional service; then one can understand Your absolute nature and
Your transcendental form, name and quality. Actually, only a person who has a little taste for the service of Your
lotus feet can understand Your transcendental nature or form and quality. Others may go on speculating for
millions of years, but it is not possible for them to understand even a single part of Your actual position." In other
words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, cannot be understood by the nondevotees because there is a
curtain of yogamaya which covers Krsna's actual features. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.25), naham
prakasah sarvasya. The Lord says, "I am not exposed to anyone and everyone." When Krsna came, He was actually
present on the battlefield of Kuruksetra, and everyone saw Him. But not everyone could understand that He was
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Still, everyone who died in His presence attained complete liberation from
material bondage and was transferred to the spiritual world.
Because foolish mudhas do not awaken their spiritual nature, they do not understand Krsna or Rama (avajananti
mam mudha manusim tanum asritam). Even big academic scholars, not considering the endeavors of the acaryas
who have recommended devotional service in many elaborate commentaries and notes, think that Krsna is
fictitious. This is due to a lack of transcendental knowledge and a failure to awaken Krsna consciousness. One
should have the common sense to ask why, if Krsna or Rama were fictitious, stalwart scholars like Sridhara Svami,
Rupa Gosvami, Sanatana Gosvami, Viraraghava, Vijayadhvaja, Vallabhacarya and many other recognized acaryas
would have spent so much time to write about Krsna in notes and commentaries on Srimad-Bhagavatam.

O Lord, Your transcendental name and form are not ascertained by those who merely speculate on the path of
imagination. Your name, form and attributes can be ascertained only through devotional service.
As stated in the Padma Purana:
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
"One cannot understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of Sri Krsna through
one's materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the
Lord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." Since Krsna and His
transcendental name, form and activities are all of a transcendental nature, ordinary persons or those who are only
slightly advanced cannot understand them. Even big scholars who are nondevotees think that Krsna is fictitious.
Yet although so-called scholars and commentators do not believe that Krsna was factually a historical person whose
presence on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra is recorded in the history of Mahabharata, they feel compelled to write
commentaries on Bhagavad-gita and other historical records. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah:
Krsna's transcendental name, form, attributes and activities can be revealed only when one engages in His service
in full consciousness. This confirms Krsna's own words in Bhagavad-gita (18.55):
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service. And when one is
in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God." Only by
sevonmukha, by engaging oneself in the Lord's service, can one realize the name, form and qualities of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
"O Lord," the demigods say, "the impersonalists, who are nondevotees, cannot understand that Your name is
identical with Your form." Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His name and His actual form.
In the material world there is a difference between form and name. The mango fruit is different from the name of
the mango. One cannot taste the mango fruit simply by chanting, "Mango, mango, mango." But the devotee who
knows that there is no difference between the name and the form of the Lord chants Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, and realizes that he is always in Krsna's
company.
For persons who are not very advanced in absolute knowledge of the Supreme, Lord Krsna exhibits His
transcendental pastimes. They can simply think of the pastimes of the Lord and get the full benefit. Since there is
no difference between the transcendental name and form of the Lord, there is no difference between the
transcendental pastimes and the form of the Lord. For those who are less intelligent (like women, laborers or the
mercantile class), the great sage Vyasadeva wrote Mahabharata. In the Mahabharata, Krsna is present in His
different activities. Mahabharata is history, and simply by studying, hearing, and memorizing the transcendental
activities of Krsna, the less intelligent can also gradually rise to the standard of pure devotees.
The pure devotees, who are always absorbed in the thought of the transcendental lotus feet of Krsna and who are
always engaged in devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, are never to be considered to be in the material
world. Srila Rupa Gosvami has explained that those who are always engaged in Krsna consciousness by body, mind
and activities are to be considered liberated even within this body. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita:
those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord have already transcended the material position.
Krsna appears in order to give a chance to both the devotees and the nondevotees for realization of the ultimate
goal of life. The devotees get the direct chance to see Him and worship Him. Those who are not on that platform
get the chance to become acquainted with His activities and thus become elevated to the same position.
The Brahma-samhita (5.38) says:
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Although Krsna's transcendental form is presented as black, devotees who are in love with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead appreciate the Lord as Syamasundara, having a very beautiful blackish form. The Lord's
form is so beautiful that the Brahma-samhita (5.30) also states:
venum kvanantam aravinda-dalayataksam
barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam
kandarpa-koti-kamaniya-visesa-sobham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who plays on His transcendental flute. His eyes are like lotus flowers, He
is decorated with peacock plumes, and His bodily color resembles the color of a fresh black cloud, although His
bodily features are more beautiful than millions of Cupids." This beauty of the Supreme Lord can be seen by
devotees who are in love with Him, devotees whose eyes are anointed with love of Godhead (premanjana-cchuritabhakti-
vilocanena).
The Lord is also known as Giridhari or Girivara-dhari. Because Krsna, for the sake of His devotees, lifted
Govardhana Hill, the devotees appreciate the Lord's inconceivable strength; but nondevotees, in spite of directly
perceiving the Lord's inconceivable strength and power, regard the Lord's activities as fictitious. This is the
difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Nondevotees cannot give any nomenclature for the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, yet the Lord is known as Syamasundara and Giridhari. Similarly, the Lord is known as
Devaki-nandana and Yasoda-nandana because He accepted the role of son for mother Devaki and mother Yasoda,
and He is known as Gopala because He enjoyed the sport of maintaining the cows and calves. Therefore, although
He has no mundane name, He is addressed by devotees as Devaki-nandana, Yasoda-nandana, Gopala and
Syamasundara. These are all transcendental names that only devotees can appreciate and nondevotees cannot.
The history of Krsna the person has been openly seen by everyone, yet only those who are in love with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead can appreciate this history, whereas nondevotees, who have not developed their
loving qualities, think that the activities, form and attributes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are fictitious.
Therefore this verse explains, na nama-rupe guna janma-karmabhir nirupitavye tava tasya saksinah. In this
connection, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has given the example that persons suffering from jaundice
cannot taste the sweetness of sugar candy, although everyone knows that sugar candy is sweet. Similarly, because
of the material disease, nondevotees cannot understand the transcendental name, form, attributes and activities of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although they actually see the Lord's activities, either through authority or
through history. The Puranas are old, authentic histories, but nondevotees cannot understand them, especially
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is the essence of Vedic knowledge. Nondevotees cannot understand even the
preliminary study of transcendental knowledge, Bhagavad-gita. They simply speculate and present commentaries
with absurd distortions. In conclusion, unless one elevates himself to the transcendental platform by practicing
bhakti-yoga, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His name, form, attributes or
activities. But if by chance, by the association of devotees, one can actually understand the Lord and His features,
one immediately becomes a liberated person. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body,
take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore said that by affection and love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
devotees can express their mind to Him with their words. Others, however, cannot do this, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah).

srnvan--constantly hearing about the Lord (sravanam kirtanam visnoh); grnan--chanting or reciting (the holy
name of the Lord and His activities); samsmarayan--remembering (constantly thinking of the Lord's lotus feet and
His form); ca--and; cintayan--contemplating (the transcendental activities of the Lord); namani--His transcendental

at Your lotus feet; avista-cetah--the devotee who is completely absorbed (in such activities); na--not;
bhavaya--for the material platform; kalpate--is fit.
Even while engaged in various activities, devotees whose minds are completely absorbed at Your lotus feet, and
who constantly hear, chant, contemplate and cause others to remember Your transcendental names and forms, are
always on the transcendental platform, and thus they can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
How bhakti-yoga can be practiced is explained in this verse. Srila Rupa Gosvami has said that anyone who has
dedicated his life to the service of the Lord (iha yasya harer dasye) by his activities, his mind and his words
(karmana manasa gira) may stay in any condition of life (nikhilasv apy avasthasu) and yet is no longer actually
conditioned but is liberated (jivan-muktah sa ucyate). Even though such a devotee is in a material body, he has
nothing to do with this body, for he is transcendentally situated. Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati:
because a devotee is engaged in transcendental activities, he is not afraid of being materially embodied. (Bhag.
6.17.28) Illustrating this liberated position, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu prayed, mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: "All I want is Your causeless devotional service in My life, birth after birth."
(Siksastaka 4) Even if a devotee, by the supreme will of the Lord, takes birth in this material world, he continues
his devotional service. When King Bharata made a mistake and in his next life became a deer, his devotional service
did not stop, although some slight chastisement was given to him because of his negligence. Narada Muni says that
even if one falls from the platform of devotional service, he is not lost, whereas nondevotees are lost entirely
because they are not engaged in service. Bhagavad-gita (9.14) therefore recommends that one always engage at
least in chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra:
satatam kirtayanto mam
yatantas ca drdha-vratah
namasyantas ca mam bhaktya
nitya-yukta upasate
"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great souls
perpetually worship Me with devotion."
One should not give up the process of devotional service, which is performed in nine different ways (sravanam
kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam, etc.). The most important process is hearing (sravanam) from the guru,
sadhu and sastra--the spiritual master, the saintly acaryas and the Vedic literature. Sadhu-sastra-guru-vakya, cittete
kariya aikya. We should not hear the commentaries and explanations of nondevotees, for this is strictly forbidden
by Srila Sanatana Gosvami, who quotes from the padma purana:
avaisnava-mukhodgirnam
putam hari-kathamrtam
sravanam naiva kartavyam
sarpocchistam yatha payah
We should strictly follow this injunction and never try to hear from Mayavadis, impersonalists, voidists,
politicians or so-called scholars. Strictly avoiding such inauspicious association, we should simply hear from pure
devotees. Srila Rupa Gosvami therefore recommends, sri-guru-padasrayah: one must seek shelter at the lotus feet of
a pure devotee who can be one's guru. Caitanya Mahaprabhu advises that a guru is one who strictly follows the
instructions of Bhagavad-gita: yare dekha, tare kaha, 'krsna'--upadesa (Cc. Madhya 7.128). A juggler, a magician or
one who speaks nonsense as an academic career is not a guru. Rather, a guru is one who presents Bhagavad-gita,
Krsna's instructions, as it is. Sravana is very important; one must hear from the Vaisnava sadhu, guru and sastra.
The word kriyasu, meaning "by manual labor" or "by work," is important in this verse. One should engage in
practical service to the Lord. In our Krsna consciousness movement, all our activities are concentrated upon
distributing Krsna literature. This is very important. One may approach any person and induce him to read Krsna
literature so that in the future he also may become a devotee. Such activities are recommended in this verse.
Kriyasu yas tvac-caranaravindayoh. Such activities will always remind the devotees of the Lord's lotus feet. By fully
concentrating on distributing books for Krsna, one is fully absorbed in Krsna. This is samadhi.

O Lord, we are fortunate because the heavy burden of the demons upon this earth is immediately removed by
Your appearance. Indeed, we are certainly fortunate, for we shall be able to see upon this earth and in the heavenly
planets the marks of lotus, conchshell, club and disc that adorn Your lotus feet.
The soles of the Lord's lotus feet are marked with sankha-cakra-gada-padma--conchshell, disc, club and lotus--
and also by a flag and a thunderbolt. When Krsna walks on this earth or in the heavenly planets, these marks are
visible wherever He goes. Vrndavana-dhama is a transcendental place because of Krsna's walking on this land
frequently. The inhabitants of Vrndavana were fortunate to see these marks here and there. When Akrura went to
Vrndavana to take Krsna and Balarama away to the festival arranged by Kamsa, upon seeing the marks of the Lord's
lotus feet on the ground of Vrndavana, he fell down and began to groan. These marks are visible to devotees who
receive the causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (tavanukampitam). The demigods were jubilant
not only because the appearance of the Supreme Lord would do away with the burdensome demons, but also
because they would be able to see upon the ground the transcendental marks from the soles of the Lord's lotus feet.
The gopis always thought of the Lord's lotus feet when He was walking in the pasturing grounds, and, as described
in the previous verse, simply by thinking of the Lord's lotus feet, the gopis were fully absorbed in transcendence
(avista-ceta na bhavaya kalpate). Like the gopis, one who is always absorbed in thought of the Lord is beyond the
material platform and will not remain in this material world. It is our duty, therefore, always to hear, chant and
think about the Lord's lotus feet, as actually done by Vaisnavas who have decided to live in Vrndavana always and
think of the Lord's lotus feet twenty-four hours a day.

when these living entities are conducted by Your external energy.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.7), mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah: the living entities are parts and
parcels of the Supreme Lord, and thus they are qualitatively one with the Lord. We can understand that when the
Supreme Lord appears or disappears as an incarnation, there is no other cause than His pleasure potency. We
cannot force the Supreme Personality of Godhead to appear. As He says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise
of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." When there is a need to diminish a burden created by the demons, the
Supreme Godhead can do it in many ways because He has multifarious energies. There is no need for Him to come
as an incarnation, since He is not forced to do anything like ordinary living entities. The living entities come to this
material world in the spirit of enjoyment, but because they want to enjoy without Krsna (krsna-bahirmukha haiya
bhoja-vancha kare), they suffer birth, death, old age and disease under the control of the illusory energy. When the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, however, no such causes are involved; His descent is an act of His
pleasure potency. We should always remember this distinction between the Lord and the ordinary living entity and
not uselessly argue that the Lord cannot come. There are philosophers who do not believe in the Lord's incarnation
and who ask, "Why should the Supreme Lord come?" But the answer is, "Why should He not come? Why should
He be controlled by the desire of the living entity?" The Lord is free to do whatever He likes. Therefore this verse
says, vina vinodam bata tarkayamahe. It is only for His pleasure that He comes although He does not need to come.
When the living entities come to this world for material enjoyment, they are entangled in karma and karma-phala
by the Lord's illusory energy. But if one seeks shelter at the Lord's lotus feet, one is again situated in his original,
liberated state. As stated here, krta yatas tvayy abhayasrayatmani: one who seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord
is always fearless. Because we are dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we should give up the idea
that without Krsna we can enjoy freedom in this material world. This idea is the reason we have become entangled.
Now it is our duty to seek shelter again at the Lord's lotus feet. This shelter is described as abhaya, or fearless. Since
Krsna is not subject to birth, death, old age or disease, and since we are part and parcel of Krsna, we also are not
subject to birth, death, old age and disease, but we have become subject to these illusory problems because of our
forgetfulness of Krsna and our position as His eternal servants (jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa').
Therefore, if we practice devotional service by always thinking of the Lord, always glorifying Him and always
chanting about Him, as described in text 37 (srnvan grnan samsmarayams ca cintayan), we will be reinstated in our
original, constitutional position and thus be saved. The demigods, therefore, encouraged Devaki not to fear Kamsa,
but to think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was already within her womb.

In every incarnation, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has a particular mission to execute, and this was true
in His appearance as the son of Devaki in the family of the Yadus. Thus all the demigods offered their prayers to
the Lord, bowing down before Him, and requested the Lord to do the needful. We cannot order the Supreme
personality of Godhead to do anything for us. We can simply offer Him our obeisances, as advised in Bhagavad-gita
(man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru), and pray to Him for annihilation of dangers.

Supreme Personality; yat-rupam--whose form; anidam--transcendental; yatha--as; brahma--Lord Brahma; isanau--
and Lord Siva; purodhaya--keeping them in front; devah--all the demigods; pratiyayuh--returned; divam--to their

After thus offering prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, the Transcendence, all the
demigods, with Lord Brahma and Lord Siva before them, returned to their homes in the heavenly planets.
It is said:
adyapiha caitanya ei saba lila kare
yan'ra bhagye thake, se dekhaye nirantare
(Caitanya-bhagavata, Madhya 23.513)
The incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead appear continuously, like the waves of a river or an
ocean. There is no limit to the Lord's incarnations, but they can be perceived only by devotees who are fortunate.
The devatas, the demigods, fortunately understood the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
thus they offered their prayers. Then Lord Siva and Lord Brahma led the demigods in returning to their homes.
The word kuksi-gatah, meaning "within the womb of Devaki," has been discussed by Sri Jiva Gosvami in his
Krama-sandarbha commentary. Since it was said at first that Krsna was present within the heart of Vasudeva and
was transferred to the heart of Devaki, Sri Jiva Gosvami writes, how is it that Krsna was now in the womb? He
replies that there is no contradiction. From the heart the Lord can go to the womb, or from the womb He can go to
the heart. Indeed, He can go or stay anywhere. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.35), andantara-sthaparamanu-
cayantara-stham govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. The Lord can stay wherever He likes.
Devaki, therefore, in accordance with the desire of her former life, now had the opportunity to seek the benediction
of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead as her son, Devaki-nandana.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"Prayers by the Demigods for Lord Krsna in the Womb."
Chapter Three
The Birth of Lord Krsna
As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, Hari in His original form, appeared as
Visnu so that His father and mother could understand that their son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Because they were afraid of Kamsa, when the Lord appeared as an ordinary child they took Him to Gokula, the
home of Nanda Maharaja.
Mother Devaki, being fully transcendental, sac-cid-ananda, does not belong to this material world. Thus the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared with four hands, as if born from her womb. Upon seeing the Lord in
that Visnu form, Vasudeva was struck with wonder, and in transcendental happiness he and Devaki mentally gave
ten thousand cows in charity to the brahmanas. Vasudeva then offered prayers to the Lord, addressing Him as the
Supreme Person, Parabrahman, the Supersoul, who is beyond duality and who is internally and externally allpervading.
The Lord, the cause of all causes, is beyond material existence, although He is the creator of this
material world. When He enters this world as Paramatma, He is all-pervading (andantara-stha-paramanucayantara-
stham), yet He is transcendentally situated. For the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this
material world, the Lord appears as the guna-avataras--Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. Thus Vasudeva offered
prayers full of meaning to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devaki followed her husband by offering prayers
describing the transcendental nature of the Lord. Fearing Kamsa and desiring that the Lord not be understood by
atheistic and materialistic nondevotees, she prayed that the Lord withdraw His transcendental four-armed form and
appear like an ordinary child with two hands.
The Lord reminded Vasudeva and Devaki of two other incarnations in which He had appeared as their son. He
had appeared as Prsnigarbha and Vamanadeva, and now this was the third time He was appearing as the son of
Devaki to fulfill their desire. The Lord then decided to leave the residence of Vasudeva and Devaki, in the prison
house of Kamsa, and at this very time, Yogamaya took birth as the daughter of Yasoda. By the arrangement of
Yogamaya, Vasudeva was able to leave the prison house and save the child from the hands of Kamsa. When
Vasudeva brought Krsna to the house of Nanda Maharaja, he saw that by Yogamaya's arrangement, Yasoda, as well
as everyone else, was deeply asleep. Thus he exchanged the babies, taking Yogamaya from Yasoda's lap and placing
Krsna there instead. Then Vasudeva returned to his own place, having taken Yogamaya as his daughter. He placed
Yogamaya on Devaki's bed and prepared to be a prisoner as before. In Gokula, Yasoda could not understand
whether she had given birth to a male or a female child.

dundubhayah--kettledrums; samam--simultaneously (from the upper planets).
Thereafter, at the auspicious time for the appearance of the Lord, the entire universe was surcharged with all the
qualities of goodness, beauty and peace. The constellation Rohini appeared, as did stars like Asvini. The sun, the
moon and the other stars and planets were very peaceful. All directions appeared extremely pleasing, and the
beautiful stars twinkled in the cloudless sky. Decorated with towns, villages, mines and pasturing grounds, the
earth seemed all-auspicious. The rivers flowed with clear water, and the lakes and vast reservoirs, full of lilies and
lotuses, were extraordinarily beautiful. In the trees and green plants, full of flowers and leaves, pleasing to the eyes,
birds like cuckoos and swarms of bees began chanting with sweet voices for the sake of the demigods. A pure
breeze began to blow, pleasing the sense of touch and bearing the aroma of flowers, and when the brahmanas
engaging in ritualistic ceremonies ignited their fires according to Vedic principles, the fires burned steadily,
undisturbed by the breeze. Thus when the birthless Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to
appear, the saints and brahmanas, who had always been disturbed by demons like Kamsa and his men, felt peace
within the core of their hearts, and kettledrums simultaneously vibrated from the upper planetary system.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that His appearance, birth, and activities are all transcendental and
that one who factually understands them is immediately eligible to be transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord's
appearance or birth is not like that of an ordinary man, who is forced to accept a material body according to his
past deeds. The Lord's appearance is explained in the previous chapter: He appears out of His own sweet pleasure.
When the time was mature for the appearance of the Lord, the constellations became very auspicious. The
astrological influence of the constellation known as Rohini was also predominant because this constellation is
considered very auspicious. Rohini is under the direct supervision of Brahma, who is born of Visnu, and it appears
at the birth of Lord Visnu, who in fact is birthless. According to the astrological conclusion, besides the proper
situation of the stars, there are auspicious and inauspicious moments due to the different situations of the different
planetary systems. At the time of Krsna's birth, the planetary systems were automatically adjusted so that
everything became auspicious.
At that time, in all directions, east, west, south, north, everywhere, there was an atmosphere of peace and
prosperity. Auspicious stars were visible in the sky, and on the surface in all towns and villages or pasturing
grounds and within the mind of everyone there were signs of good fortune. The rivers were flowing full of water,
and the lakes were beautifully decorated with lotus flowers. The forests were full with beautiful birds and peacocks.
All the birds within the forests began to sing with sweet voices, and the peacocks began to dance with their
consorts. The wind blew very pleasantly, carrying the aroma of different flowers, and the sensation of bodily touch
was very pleasing. At home, the brahmanas, who were accustomed to offer sacrifices in the fire, found their homes
very pleasant for offerings. Because of disturbances created by the demoniac kings, the sacrificial fire had been
almost stopped in the houses of brahmanas, but now they could find the opportunity to start the fire peacefully.
Being forbidden to offer sacrifices, the brahmanas were very distressed in mind, intelligence and activities. But just
on the point of Krsna's appearance, automatically their minds became full of joy because they could hear loud
vibrations in the sky of transcendental sounds proclaiming the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
On the occasion of Lord Krsna's birth, seasonal changes took place throughout the entire universe. Krsna was
born during the month of September, yet it appeared like springtime. The atmosphere, however, was very cool,
although not chilly, and the rivers and reservoirs appeared just as they would in sarat, the fall. Lotuses and lilies
blossom during the day, but although Krsna appeared at twelve o'clock midnight, the lilies and lotuses were in
bloom, and thus the wind blowing at that time was full of fragrance. Because of Kamsa's disturbances, the Vedic
ritualistic ceremonies had almost stopped. The brahmanas and saintly persons could not execute the Vedic rituals
with peaceful minds. But now the brahmanas were very pleased to perform their daily ritualistic ceremonies
undisturbed. The business of the asuras is to disturb the suras, the devotees and brahmanas, but at the time of
Krsna's appearance these devotees and brahmanas were undisturbed.

The demigods and great saintly persons showered flowers in a joyous mood, and clouds gathered in the sky and
very mildly thundered, making sounds like those of the ocean's waves. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Visnu, who is situated in the core of everyone's heart, appeared from the heart of Devaki in the dense darkness of
night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, because Devaki was of the same category as Sri Krsna.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.37):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuto
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
This verse indicates that Krsna and His entourage are of the same spiritual potency (ananda-cinmaya-rasa).
Krsna's father, His mother, His friends the cowherd boys, and the cows are all expansions of Krsna, as will be
explained in the brahma-vimohana-lila. When Brahma took away Krsna's associates to test the supremacy of Lord
Krsna, the Lord expanded Himself again in the forms of the many cowherd boys and calves, all of whom, as
Brahma saw, were visnu-murtis. Devaki is also an expansion of Krsna, and therefore this verse says, devakyam
deva-rupinyam visnuh sarva-guha-sayah.
At the time for the Lord's appearance, the great sages and the demigods, being pleased, began to shower flowers.
At the seashore, there was the sound of mild waves, and above the sea there were clouds in the sky which began to
thunder very pleasingly.
When things were adjusted like this, Lord Visnu, who is residing within the heart of every living entity, appeared
in the darkness of night as the Supreme Personality of Godhead before Devaki, who appeared as one of the
demigoddesses. The appearance of Lord Visnu at that time could be compared to the rising of the full moon in the
sky on the eastern horizon. The objection may be raised that since Lord Krsna appeared on the eighth day of the
waning moon, there could be no rising of the full moon. In answer to this it may be said that Lord Krsna appeared
in the dynasty which is in the hierarchy of the moon; therefore, although the moon was incomplete on that night,
because of the Lord's appearance in the dynasty wherein the moon is himself the original person, the moon was in
an overjoyous condition, so by the grace of Krsna he could appear as a full moon. To welcome the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the waning moon became a full moon in jubilation.
Instead of deva-rupinyam, some texts of Srimad-Bhagavatam clearly say visnu-rupinyam. In either case, the
meaning is that Devaki has the same spiritual form as the Lord. The Lord is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, and Devaki is
also sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. Therefore no one can find any fault in the way the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, appeared from the womb of Devaki.
Those who are not in full knowledge that the appearance and disappearance of the Lord are transcendental
(janma karma ca me divyam) are sometimes surprised that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can take birth like
an ordinary child. Actually, however, the Lord's birth is never ordinary. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
already situated within the core of everyone's heart as antaryami, the Supersoul. Thus because He was present in
full potency in Devaki's heart, He was also able to appear outside her body.
One of the twelve great personalities is Bhismadeva (svayambhur naradah sambhuh kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlada, janako bhismah). In Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.9.42), Bhisma, a great authority to be followed by devotees,
says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in the core of everyone's heart, just as the sun may be on
everyone's head. Yet although the sun may be on the heads of millions and millions of people, this does not mean
that the sun is variously situated. Similarly, because the Supreme Personality of Godhead has inconceivable
potencies, He can be within everyone's heart and yet not be situated variously. Ekatvam anupasyatah (Isopanisad
7). The Lord is one, but He can appear in everyone's heart by His inconceivable potency. Thus although the Lord
was within the heart of Devaki, He appeared as her child. According to the Visnu purana, therefore, as quoted in
the Vaisnava-tosani, the Lord appeared like the sun (anugrahasaya). The Brahma-samhita (5.35) confirms that the
Lord is situated even within the atom (andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham). He is situated in Mathura, in
Vaikuntha and in the core of the heart. Therefore one should clearly understand that He did not live like an
ordinary child in the heart or the womb of Devaki. Nor did He appear like an ordinary human child, although He
seemed to do so in order to bewilder asuras like Kamsa. I he asuras wrongly think that Krsna took birth like an
ordinary child and passed away from this world like an ordinary man. Such asuric conceptions are rejected by
persons in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ajo 'pi sann avyayatma bhutanam isvaro 'pi san (Bg.
4.6). As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord is aja, unborn, and He is the supreme controller of everything.
Nonetheless, He appeared as the child of Devaki. This verse describes the inconceivable potency of the Lord, who
appeared like the full moon. Understanding the special significance of the appearance of the Supreme Godhead,
one should never regard Him as having taken birth like an ordinary child.

Vasudeva then saw the newborn child, who had very wonderful lotuslike eyes and who bore in His four hands
the four weapons sankha, cakra, gada and padma. On His chest was the mark of Srivatsa and on His neck the
brilliant Kaustubha gem. Dressed in yellow, His body blackish like a dense cloud, His scattered hair fully grown,
and His helmet and earrings sparkling uncommonly with the valuable gem Vaidurya, the child, decorated with a
brilliant belt, armlets, bangles and other ornaments, appeared very wonderful.
To support the word adbhutam, meaning "wonderful," the decorations and opulences of the newborn child are
fully described. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.30), barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam: the hue of
the Lord's beautiful form resembles the blackish color of dense clouds (asita means "blackish," and ambuda means
"cloud"). It is clear from the word catur-bhujam that Krsna first appeared with four hands, as Lord Visnu. No
ordinary child in human society has ever been born with four hands. And when is a child born with fully grown
hair? The descent of the Lord, therefore, is completely distinct from the birth of an ordinary child. The Vaidurya
gem, which sometimes appears bluish, sometimes yellow and sometimes red, is available in Vaikunthaloka. The
Lord's helmet and earrings were decorated with this particular gem.

sah--he (Vasudeva, also known as Anakadundubhi); vismaya-utphulla-vilocanah--his eyes being struck with
wonder at the beautiful appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; harim--Lord Hari, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; sutam--as his son; vilokya--observing; anakadundubhih--Vasudeva; tada--at that time;
krsna-avatara-utsava--for a festival to be observed because of Krsna's appearance; sambhramah--wishing to
welcome the Lord with great respect; asprsat--took advantage by distributing; muda--with great jubilation;
dvijebhyah--to the brahmanas; ayutam--ten thousand; aplutah--overwhelmed, surcharged; gavam--cows.
When Vasudeva saw his extraordinary son, his eyes were struck with wonder. In transcendental jubilation, he
mentally collected ten thousand cows and distributed them among the brahmanas as a transcendental festival.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has analyzed the wonder of Vasudeva upon seeing his extraordinary child.
Vasudeva was shivering with wonder to see a newborn child decorated so nicely with valuable garments and gems.
He could immediately understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had appeared, not as an ordinary child
but in His original, fully decorated, four-handed form. The first wonder was that the Lord was not afraid to appear
within the prison house of Kamsa, where Vasudeva and Devaki were interned. Second, although the Lord, the
Supreme Transcendence, is all-pervading, He had appeared from the womb of Devaki. The third point of wonder,
therefore, was that a child could take birth from the womb so nicely decorated. Fourth, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was Vasudeva's worshipable Deity yet had taken birth as his son. For all these reasons, Vasudeva was
transcendentally jubilant, and he wanted to perform a festival, as ksatriyas do to celebrate the birth of a child, but
because of his imprisonment he was unable to do it externally, and therefore he performed the festival within his
mind. This was just as good. If one cannot externally serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can serve the
Lord within one's mind, since the activities of the mind are as good as those of the other senses. This is called the
nondual or absolute situation (advaya jnana). People generally perform ritualistic ceremonies for the birth of a
child. Why then should Vasudeva not have performed such a ceremony when the Supreme Lord appeared as his
son?

O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of King Bharata, Vasudeva could understand that this child was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Having concluded this without a doubt, he became fearless. Bowing down with
folded hands and concentrating his attention, he began to offer prayers to the child, who illuminated His birthplace
by His natural influence.
Struck with such great wonder, Vasudeva now concentrated his attention on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Understanding the influence of the Supreme Lord, he was surely fearless, since he understood that the
Lord had appeared to give him protection (gata-bhih prabhava-vit). Understanding that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was present, he appropriately offered prayers as follows.

Vasudeva said: My Lord, You are the Supreme Person, beyond material existence, and You are the Supersoul.
Your form can be perceived by transcendental knowledge, by which You can be understood as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. I now understand Your position perfectly.
Within Vasudeva's heart, affection for his son and knowledge of the Supreme Lord's transcendental nature both
awakened In the beginning Vasudeva thought, "Such a beautiful child has been born, but now Kamsa will come
and kill Him." But when he understood that this was not an ordinary child but the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he became fearless. Regarding his son as the Supreme Lord, wonderful in everything, he began offering
prayers appropriate for the Supreme Lord. Completely free from fear of Kamsa's atrocities, he accepted the child
simultaneously as an object of affection and as an object of worship by prayers.

(mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram); idam--this material world; srstva--after creating; agre--in the

Your Lordship; hi--indeed; apravistah--although You did not enter; pravistah iva--You appear to have entered;

My Lord, You are the same person who in the beginning created this material world by His personal external
energy. After the creation of this world of three gunas [sattva, rajas and tamas], You appear to have entered it,
although in fact You have not.
In Bhagavad-gita (7.4) the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains:
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
This material world of three modes of nature--sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna--is a composition of earth,
water, fire, air, mind, intelligence and false ego, all of which are energies coming from Krsna, yet Krsna, being
always transcendental, is aloof from this material world. Those who are not in pure knowledge think that Krsna is a
product of matter and that His body is material like ours (avajananti mam mudhah). In fact, however, Krsna is
always aloof from this material world.
In the Vedic literature, we find the creation described in relationship to Maha-Visnu. As stated in the Brahmasamhita
(5.35):
eko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim
yac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead. By His partial plenary expansion as
Maha-Visnu, He enters into material nature. Then He enters every universe as Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and He
enters all the elements, including every atom of matter, as Ksirodakasayi Visnu. Such manifestations of cosmic
creation are innumerable, both in the universes and in the individual atoms." Govinda is partially exhibited as
antaryami, the Supersoul, who enters this material world (andantara-stha) and who is also within the atom. The
Brahma-samhita (5.48) further says:
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
This verse describes Maha-Visnu as a plenary expansion of Krsna. Maha-Visnu lies on the Causal Ocean, and
when He exhales, millions of brahmandas, or universes, come from the pores of His body. Then, when Maha-Visnu
inhales, all these brahmandas disappear. Thus the millions of brahmandas controlled by the Brahmas and other
demigods come and go in this material world through the breathing of Maha-Visnu.
Foolish persons think that when Krsna appears as the son of Vasudeva, He is limited like an ordinary child. But
Vasudeva was aware that although the Lord had appeared as his son, the Lord had not entered Devaki's womb and
then come out. Rather, the Lord was always there. The Supreme Lord is all-pervading, present within and without.
pravista iva bhavyase: He only seemed to have entered the womb of Devaki and to have now appeared as
Vasudeva's child. The expression of this knowledge by Vasudeva indicates that Vasudeva knew how these events
took place. Vasudeva was certainly a devotee of the Lord in full knowledge, and we must learn from devotees like
him. Bhagavad-gita (4.34) therefore recommends:
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service
unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth." Vasudeva begot
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, yet he was in full knowledge of how the Supreme Lord appears and
disappears. He was therefore tattva-darsi, a seer of the truth, because he personally saw how the Supreme Absolute
Truth appeared as his son. Vasudeva was not in ignorance, thinking that because the Supreme Godhead had
appeared as his son, the Lord had become limited. The Lord is unlimitedly existing and all-pervading, inside and
outside. Thus there is no question of His appearance or disappearance.

The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, is undivided, but because of the material modes of nature, it appears
to separate into earth, water, fire, air and ether. Because of the living energy [jiva-bhuta], these separated energies
combine to make the cosmic manifestation visible, but in fact, before the creation of the cosmos, the total energy is
already present. Therefore, the total material energy never actually enters the creation. Similarly, although You are
perceived by our senses because of Your presence, You cannot be perceived by the senses, nor experienced by the
mind or words [avan-manasa-gocara]. With our senses we can perceive some things, but not everything; for
example, we can use our eyes to see, but not to taste. Consequently, You are beyond perception by the senses.
Although in touch with the modes of material nature, You are unaffected by them. You are the prime factor in
everything, the all-pervading, undivided Supersoul. For You, therefore, there is no external or internal. You never
entered the womb of Devaki; rather, You existed there already.
This same understanding is explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.4):
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad-avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them."
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord Sri
Krsna's name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure
devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always, within oneself and outside oneself, if one has
developed the transcendental loving attitude toward Him. Thus for people in general, He is not visible. In the
above-mentioned verse from Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere
present, He is not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is
resting in Him. As discussed in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, the entire material cosmic manifestation is
only a combination of His two different energies, the superior, spiritual energy and the inferior, material energy.
Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and
everything is resting in that energy.
Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such
arguments, the Lord says, "I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof." For example, a king
heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king's energy; the different governmental departments
are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king's power. But still one cannot
expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the
manifestations that we see, and everything that exists, both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are
resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His
different energies, and, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the
diffusion of His different energies.
One may argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who creates the whole cosmic manifestation simply by
His glance, cannot come within the womb of Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva. To eradicate this argument, Vasudeva
said, "My dear Lord, it is not very wonderful that You appeared within the womb of Devaki, for the creation was
also made in that way. You were lying in the Causal Ocean as Maha-Visnu, and by Your breathing, innumerable
universes came into existence. Then You entered into each of the universes as Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Then again
You expanded Yourself as Ksirodakasayi Visnu and entered into the heart of all living entities and entered even
within the atoms. Therefore Your entrance into the womb of Devaki is understandable in the same way. You appear
to have entered, but You are simultaneously all-pervading. We can understand Your entrance and nonentrance
from material examples. The total material energy remains intact even after being divided into sixteen elements.
The material body is nothing but a combination of the five gross elements--namely earth, water, fire, air and ether.
Whenever there is a material body, it appears that such elements are newly created, but actually the elements are
always existing outside of the body. Similarly, although You appear as a child in the womb of Devaki, You are also
existing outside. You are always in Your abode, but still You can simultaneously expand Yourself into millions of
forms.
"One has to understand Your appearance with great intelligence because the material energy is also emanating
from You. You are the original source of the material energy, just as the sun is the source of the sunshine. The
sunshine cannot cover the sun globe, nor can the material energy--being an emanation from You--cover You. You
appear to be in the three modes of material energy, but actually the three modes of material energy cannot cover
You. This is understood by the highly intellectual philosophers. In other words, although You appear to be within
the material energy, You are never covered by it."
We hear from the Vedic version that the Supreme Brahman exhibits His effulgence and therefore everything is
illuminated. We can understand from Brahma-samhita that the brahmajyoti, or the Brahman effulgence, emanates
from the body of the Supreme Lord. And from the Brahman effulgence, all creation takes place. It is further stated
in the Bhagavad-gita that the Lord is the support of the Brahman effulgence. Originally He is the root cause of
everything. But persons who are less intelligent think that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes within
this material world, He accepts material qualities. Such conclusions are not mature, but are, made by the less
intelligent.

yah--anyone who; atmanah--of his own real identity, the soul; drsya-gunesu--among the visible objects,
beginning with the body; san--being situated in that position; iti--thus; vyavasyate--continues to act; svavyatirekatah--
as if the body were independent of the soul; abudhah--a rascal; vina anuvadam--without proper

been discussed; samyak--fully; yatah--because he is a fool; tyaktam--are rejected; upadadat--accepts this body as

One who considers his visible body, which is a product of the three modes of nature, to be independent of the
soul is unaware of the basis of existence, and therefore he is a rascal. Those who are learned have rejected his
conclusion because one can understand through full discussion that with no basis in soul, the visible body and
senses would be insubstantial. Nonetheless, although his conclusion has been rejected, a foolish person considers it
a reality.
Without the basic principle of soul, the body cannot be produced. So-called scientists have tried in many ways to
produce a living body in their chemical laboratories, but no one has been able to do it because unless the spirit soul
is present, a body cannot be prepared from material elements. Since scientists are now enamored of theories about
the chemical composition of the body, we have challenged many scientists to make even a small egg. The chemicals
in eggs can be found very easily. There is a white substance and a yellow substance, covered by a shell, and modern
scientists should very easily be able to duplicate all this. But even if they were to prepare such an egg and put it in
an incubator, this man-made chemical egg would not produce a chicken. The soul must be added because there is
no question of a chemical combination for life. Those who think that life can exist without the soul have therefore
been described here as abudhah, foolish rascals.
Again, there are those who reject the body, regarding it as insubstantial. They are of the same category of fools.
One can neither reject the body nor accept it as substantial. The substance is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and both the body and the soul are energies of the Supreme Godhead, as described by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My separated
material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine,
which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe."
The body, therefore, has a relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the soul does. Since
both of them are energies of the Lord, neither of them is false, because they come from the reality. One who does
not know this secret of life is described as abudhah. According to the Vedic injunctions, aitadatmyam idam sarvam,
sarvam khalv idam brahma: everything is the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, both the body and the soul are
Brahman, since matter and spirit emanate from Brahman.
Not knowing the conclusions of the Vedas, some people accept the material nature as substance, and others
accept the spirit soul as substance, but actually Brahman is the substance. Brahman is the cause of all causes. The
ingredients and the immediate cause of this manifested material world are Brahman, and we cannot make the
ingredients of this world independent of Brahman. Furthermore, since the ingredients and the immediate cause of
this material manifestation are Brahman, both of them are truth, satya; there is no validity to the expression brahma
satyam jagan mithya. The world is not false.
Jnanis reject this world, and foolish persons accept this world as reality, and in this way they are both misguided.
Although the body is not as important as the soul, we cannot say that it is false. Yet the body is temporary, and
only foolish, materialistic persons, who do not have full knowledge of the soul, regard the temporary body as
reality and engage in decorating this body. Both of these pitfalls--rejection of the body as false and acceptance of
the body as all in all--can be avoided when one is fully situated in Krsna consciousness. If we regard this world as
false, we fall into the category of asuras, who say that this world is unreal, with no foundation and no God in
control (asatyam apratistham te jagad ahur anisvaram). As described in the Sixteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita,
this is the conclusion of demons.

O my Lord, learned Vedic scholars conclude that the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the entire cosmic
manifestation are performed by You, who are free from endeavor, unaffected by the modes of material nature, and
changeless in Your spiritual situation. There are no contradictions in You, who are the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Parabrahman. Because the three modes of material nature--sattva, rajas and tamas--are under Your
control, everything takes place automatically.
As stated in the Vedas:
na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate
na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
"The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for everything is
done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) Creation, maintenance
and annihilation are all conducted personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and this is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram). Yet ultimately the Lord does not need to do
anything, and therefore He is nirvikara, changeless. Because everything is done under His direction, He is called
srsti-karta, the master of creation. Similarly, He is the master of annihilation. When a master sits in one place while
his servants work in different duties, whatever the servants are doing is ultimately an activity of the master,
although he is doing nothing (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate). The Lord's potencies are so numerous that
everything is nicely done. Therefore, He is naturally still and is not directly the doer of anything in this material
world.

sah tvam--Your Lordship, who are the same person, the Transcendence; tri-loka-sthitaye--to maintain the three
worlds, the upper, middle and lower planetary systems; sva-mayaya--by Your personal energy (atma-mayaya);
bibharsi--assume; suklam--the white form of Visnu in goodness; khalu--as well as; varnam--color; atmanah--of the

varnam--the color; tamasa--which is surrounded by ignorance; jana-atyaye--for the ultimate destruction of the
entire creation.
My Lord, Your form is transcendental to the three material modes, yet for the maintenance of the three worlds,
You assume the white color of Visnu in goodness; for creation, which is surrounded by the quality of passion, You
appear reddish; and at the end, when there is a need for annihilation, which is surrounded by ignorance, You
appear blackish.
Vasudeva prayed to the Lord, "You are called suklam. Suklam, or 'whiteness,' is the symbolic representation of
the Absolute Truth because it is unaffected by the material qualities. Lord Brahma is called rakta, or red, because
Brahma represents the qualities of passion for creation. Darkness is entrusted to Lord Siva because he annihilates
the cosmos. The creation, annihilation and maintenance of this cosmic manifestation are conducted by Your
potencies, yet You are always unaffected by those qualities." As confirmed in the Vedas, harir hi nirgunah saksat:
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always free from all material qualities. It is also said that the qualities of
passion and ignorance are nonexistent in the person of the Supreme Lord.
In this verse, the three colors mentioned--sukla, rakta and krsna--are not to be understood literally, in terms of
what we experience with our senses, but rather as representatives of sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. After
all, sometimes we see that a duck is white, although it is in tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance. Illustrating the logic
called bakandha-nyaya, the duck is such a fool that it runs after the testicles of a bull, thinking them to be a
hanging fish that can be taken when it drops. Thus the duck is always in darkness. Vyasadeva, however, the
compiler of the Vedic literature, is blackish, but this does not mean that he is in tamo-guna; rather, he is in the
highest position of sattva-guna, beyond the material modes of nature. Sometimes these colors (sukla-raktas tatha
pitah) are used to designate the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras. Lord Ksirodakasayi Visnu is celebrated as
possessing a blackish color, Lord Siva is whitish, and Lord Brahma is reddish, but according to Srila Sanatana
Gosvami in the Vaisnava-tosani-tika, this exhibition of colors is not what is referred to here.
The real understanding of sukla, rakta and krsna is as follows. The Lord is always transcendental, but for the sake
of creation He assumes the color rakta as Lord Brahma. Again, sometimes the Lord becomes angry. As He says in
Bhagavad-gita (16.19):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of
material existence, into various demoniac species of life." To destroy the demons, the Lord becomes angry, and
therefore He assumes the form of Lord Siva. In summary, the Supreme personality of Godhead is always beyond
the material qualities, and we should not be misled into thinking otherwise simply because of sense perception.
One must understand the position of the Lord through the authorities, or mahajanas. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.3.28), ete camsa-kalah pumsah krsnas tu bhagavan svayam.

nirvyuhyamanah--which are moving here and there all over the world; nihanisyase--will kill; camuh--the armies,
paraphernalia, soldiers and retinues.
O my Lord, proprietor of all creation, You have now appeared in my house, desiring to protect this world. I am
sure that You will kill all the armies that are moving all over the world under the leadership of politicians who are
dressed as ksatriya rulers but who are factually demons. They must be killed by You for the protection of the
innocent public.
Krsna appears in this world for two purposes, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: to protect the
innocent, religious devotees of the Lord and to annihilate all the uneducated, uncultured asuras, who unnecessarily
bark like dogs and fight among themselves for political power. It is said, kali-kale nama-rupe krsna avatara. The
Hare Krsna movement is also an incarnation of Krsna in the form of the holy name (nama-rupe). Every one of us
who is actually afraid of the asuric rulers and politicians must welcome this incarnation of Krsna: Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Then we will surely be protected
from the harassment of asuric rulers. At the present moment these rulers are so powerful that by hook or by crook
they capture the highest posts in government and harass countless numbers of people on the plea of national
security or some emergency. Then again, one asura defeats another asura, but the public continues to suffer.
Therefore the entire world is in a precarious condition, and the only hope is this Hare Krsna movement. Lord
Nrsimhadeva appeared when Prahlada was excessively harassed by his asuric father. Because of such asuric
fathers--that is, the ruling politicians--it is very difficult to press forward the Hare Krsna movement, but because
Krsna has now appeared in His holy name through this movement, we can hope that these asuric fathers will be
annihilated and the kingdom of God established all over the world. The entire world is now full of many asuras in
the guise of politicians, gurus, sadhus, yogis and incarnations, and they are misleading the general public away
from Krsna consciousness, which can offer true benefit to human society.

"civilized"); tava--of Your Lordship; janma--the birth; nau--our; grhe--into the home; srutva--after hearing; agrajan

O my Lord, Lord of the demigods, after hearing the prophecy that You would take birth in our home and kill
him, this uncivilized Kamsa killed so many of Your elder brothers. As soon as he hears from his lieutenants that
You have appeared, he will immediately come with weapons to kill You.
Kamsa has here been described as asabhya, meaning "uncivilized" or "most heinous," because he killed the many
children of his sister. When he heard the prophecy that he would be killed by her eighth son, this uncivilized man,
Kamsa, was immediately ready to kill his innocent sister on the occasion of her marriage. An uncivilized man can
do anything for the satisfaction of his senses. He can kill children, he can kill cows, he can kill brahmanas, he can
kill old men; he has no mercy for anyone. According to the Vedic civilization, cows, women, children, old men and
brahmanas should be excused if they are at fault. But asuras, uncivilized men, do not care about that. At the
present moment, the killing of cows and the killing of children is going on unrestrictedly, and therefore this
civilization is not at all human, and those who are conducting this condemned civilization are uncivilized asuras.
Such uncivilized men are not in favor of the Krsna consciousness movement. As public officers, they declare
without hesitation that the chanting of the Hare Krsna movement is a nuisance, although Bhagavad-gita clearly
says, satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah. According to this verse, it is the duty of the mahatmas to
chant the Hare Krsna mantra and try to spread it all over the world to the best of their ability. Unfortunately,
society is in such an uncivilized state that there are so-called mahatmas who are prepared to kill cows and children
and stop the Hare Krsna movement. Such uncivilized activities were actually demonstrated in opposition to the
Hare Krsna movement's Bombay center, Hare Krsna Land. As Kamsa was not expected to kill the beautiful child of
Devaki and Vasudeva, the uncivilized society, although unhappy about the advancement of the Krsna
consciousness movement, cannot be expected to stop it. Yet we must face many difficulties in many different ways.
Although Krsna cannot be killed, Vasudeva, as the father of Krsna, was trembling because in affection he thought
that Kamsa would immediately come and kill his son. Similarly, although the Krsna consciousness movement and
Krsna are not different and no asuras can check it, we are afraid that at any moment the asuras can stop this
movement in any part of the world.

atmajam--their son; viksya--observing; maha-purusa-laksanam--with all the symptoms of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Visnu; devaki--Krsna's mother; tam--unto Him (Krsna); upadhavat--offered prayers; kamsat--of

Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, having seen that her child had all the symptoms of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Devaki, who was very much afraid of Kamsa and unusually astonished, began to offer
prayers to the Lord.
The word suvismita, meaning "astonished," is significant in this verse. Devaki and her husband, Vasudeva, were
assured that their child was the Supreme Personality of Godhead and could not be killed by Kamsa, but because of
affection, as they thought of Kamsa's previous atrocities, they were simultaneously afraid that Krsna would be
killed. This is why the word suvismita has been used. Similarly, we are also astounded upon thinking of whether
this movement will be killed by the asuras or will continue to advance without fear.

satta-matram nirvisesam niriham
sa tvam saksad visnur adhyatma-dipah
sri-devaki uvaca--Sri Devaki said; rupam--form or substance; yat tat--because You are the same substance;
prahuh--You are sometimes called; avyaktam--not perceivable by the material senses (atah sri-krsna-namadi na
bhaved grahyam indriyaih); adyam--You are the original cause; brahma--You are known as Brahman; jyotih--light;
nirgunam--without material qualities; nirvikaram--without change, the same form of Visnu perpetually; sattamatram--
the original substance, the cause of everything; nirvisesam--You are present everywhere as the Supersoul
(within the heart of a human being and within the heart of an animal, the same substance is present); niriham--
without material desires; sah--that Supreme Person; tvam--Your Lordship; saksat--directly; visnuh--Lord Visnu;
adhyatma-dipah--the light for all transcendental knowledge (knowing You, one knows everything: yasmin vijnate
sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati).
Sri Devaki said: My dear Lord, there are different Vedas, some of which describe You as unperceivable through
words and the mind. Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of
everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and
You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly
the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything. You are
different from the light of Brahman and Paramatma, yet You are not different from them. Everything emanates
from You. Indeed, You are the cause of all causes, Lord Visnu, the light of all transcendental knowledge.
Visnu is the origin of everything, and there is no difference between Lord Visnu and Lord Krsna because both of
Them are visnu-tattva. From the Rg Veda we understand, om tad visnoh paramam padam: the original substance is
the all-pervading Lord Visnu, who is also Paramatma and the effulgent Brahman. The living entities are also part
and parcel of Visnu, who has various energies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca).
Visnu, or Krsna, is therefore everything. Lord Krsna says in the Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate: "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me."
Krsna, therefore, is the original cause of everything (sarva-karana-karanam). When Visnu expands in His allpervading
aspect, we should understand Him to be the nirakara-nirvisesa-brahmajyoti.
Although everything emanates from Krsna, He is ultimately a person. Aham adir hi devanam: He is the origin of
Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara, and from them many other demigods are manifested. Krsna therefore says in
Bhagavad-gita (14.27), brahmano hi pratisthaham; "Brahman rests upon Me." The Lord also says:
ye 'py anya-devata-bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered
without true understanding." (Bg. 9.23) There are many persons who worship different demigods, considering all
of them to be separate gods, which in fact they are not. The fact is that every demigod, and every living entity, is
part and parcel of Krsna (mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah). The demigods are also in the category of living
entities; they are not separate gods. But men whose knowledge is immature and contaminated by the modes of
material nature worship various demigods, according to their intelligence. Therefore they are rebuked in Bhagavadgita
(kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah). Because they are unintelligent and not very advanced
and have not properly considered the truth, they take to the worship of various demigods or speculate according to
various philosophies, such as the Mayavada philosophy.
Krsna, Visnu, is the actual origin of everything. As stated in the Vedas, yasya bhasa sarvam idam vibhati. The
Absolute Truth is described later in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.28.15) as satyam jnanam anantam yad brahmajyotih
sanatanam. The brahmajyoti is sanatana, eternal, yet it is dependent on Krsna (brahmano hi pratisthaham).
The Brahma-samhita states that the Lord is all-pervading. Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: He is within
this universe, and He is within the atom as Paramatma. Yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesavasudhadi-
vibhu-ti-bhinnam: Brahman is also not independent of Him. Therefore whatever a philosopher may
describe is ultimately Krsna, or Lord Visnu (sarvam khalv idam brahma, param brahma param dhama pavitram
paramam bhavan). According to different phases of understanding, Lord Visnu is differently described, but in fact
He is the origin of everything.
Because Devaki was an unalloyed devotee, she could understand that the same Lord Visnu had appeared as her
son. Therefore, after the prayers of Vasudeva, Devaki offered her prayers. She was very frightened because of her
brother's atrocities. Devaki said, "My dear Lord, Your eternal forms, like Narayana, Lord Rama, Sesa, Varaha,
Nrsimha, Vamana, Baladeva, and millions of similar incarnations emanating from Visnu, are described in the Vedic
literature as original. You are original because all Your forms as incarnations are outside of this material creation.
Your form was existing before this cosmic manifestation was created. Your forms are eternal and all-pervading.
They are self-effulgent, changeless and uncontaminated by the material qualities. Such eternal forms are evercognizant
and full of bliss; they are situated in transcendental goodness and are always engaged in different
pastimes. You are not limited to a particular form only; all such transcendental, eternal forms are self-sufficient. I
can understand that You are the Supreme Lord Visnu." We may conclude, therefore, that Lord Visnu is everything,
although He is also different from everything. This is the acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philosophy.

After millions of years, at the time of cosmic annihilation, when everything, manifested and unmanifested, is
annihilated by the force of time, the five gross elements enter into the subtle conception, and the manifested
categories enter into the unmanifested substance. At that time, You alone remain, and You are known as Ananta
Sesa-naga.
At the time of annihilation, the five gross elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--enter into the mind,
intelligence and false ego (ahankara), and the entire cosmic manifestation enters into the spiritual energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who alone remains as the origin of everything. The Lord is therefore known as
Sesa-naga, as Adi-purusa and by many other names.
Devaki therefore prayed, "After many millions of years, when Lord Brahma comes to the end of his life, the
annihilation of the cosmic manifestation takes place. At that time the five elements--namely earth, water, fire, air
and ether--enter into the mahat-tattva. The mahat-tattva again enters, by the force of time, into the nonmanifested
total material energy; the total material energy enters into the energetic pradhana, and the pradhana enters into
You. Therefore after the annihilation of the whole cosmic manifestation, You alone remain with Your
transcendental name, form, quality and paraphernalia.
"My Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You are the director of the unmanifested total
energy, and the ultimate reservoir of the material nature. My Lord, the whole cosmic manifestation is under the
influence of time, beginning from the moment up to the duration of the year. All act under Your direction. You are
the original director of everything and the reservoir of all potent energies."

O inaugurator of the material energy, this wonderful creation works under the control of powerful time, which is
divided into seconds, minutes, hours and years. This element of time, which extends for many millions of years, is
but another form of Lord Visnu. For Your pastimes, You act as the controller of time, but You are the reservoir of
all good fortune. Let me offer my full surrender unto Your Lordship.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.52):
yac-caksur esa savita sakala-grahanam
raja samasta-sura-murtir asesa-tejah
yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"The sun is the king of all planetary systems and has unlimited potency in heat and light. I worship Govinda, the
primeval Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whose control even the sun, which is considered to be
the eye of the Lord, rotates within the fixed orbit of eternal time." Although we see the cosmic manifestation as
gigantic and wonderful, it is within the limitations of kala, the time factor. This time factor is also controlled by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram).
Prakrti, the cosmic manifestation, is under the control of time. Indeed, everything is under the control of time, and
time is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Supreme Lord has no fear of the
onslaughts of time. Time is estimated according to the movements of the sun (savita). Every minute, every second,
every day, every night, every month and every year of time can be calculated according to the sun's movements.
But the sun is not independent, for it is under time's control. Bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakrah: the sun moves within
the kala-cakra, the orbit of time. The sun is under the control of time, and time is controlled by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord has no fear of time.
The Lord is addressed here as avyakta-bandhu, or the inaugurator of the movements of the entire cosmic
manifestation. Sometimes the cosmic manifestation is compared to a potter's wheel. When a potter's wheel is
spinning, who has set it in motion? It is the potter, of course, although sometimes we can see only the motion of
the wheel and cannot see the potter himself. Therefore the Lord, who is behind the motion of the cosmos, is called
avyakta-bandhu. Everything is within the limits of time, but time moves under the direction of the Lord, who is
therefore not within time's limit.

martyah--the living entities who are sure to die; mrtyu-vyala-bhitah--afraid of the serpent of death; palayan--
running (as soon as a serpent is seen, everyone runs away, fearing immediate death); lokan--to the different
planets; sarvan--all; nirbhayam--fearlessness; na adhyagacchat--do not obtain; tvat-pada-abjam--of Your lotus feet;
prapya--obtaining the shelter; yadrcchaya--by chance, by the mercy of Your Lordship and Your representative, the
spiritual master (guru-krpa, krsna-krpa); adya--presently; su-sthah--being undisturbed and mentally composed;
sete--are sleeping; mrtyuh--death; asmat--from those persons; apaiti--flees.
No one in this material world has become free from the four principles birth, death, old age and disease, even by
fleeing to various planets. But now that You have appeared, My Lord, death is fleeing in fear of You, and the living
entities, having obtained shelter at Your lotus feet by Your mercy, are sleeping in full mental peace.
There are different categories of living entities, but everyone is afraid of death. The highest aim of the karmis is to
be promoted to the higher, heavenly planets, where the duration of life is very long. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(8.17), sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh: one day of Brahma equals 1,000 yugas, and each yuga
consists of 4,300,000 years. Similarly, Brahma has a night of 1,000 times 4,300,000 years. In this way, we may
calculate Brahma's month and year, but even Brahma, who lives for millions and millions of years (dvi-parardhakala),
also must die. According to Vedic sastra, the inhabitants of the higher planetary systems live for 10,000
years, and just as Brahma's day is calculated to equal 4,300,000,000 of our years, one day in the higher planetary
systems equals six of our months. Karmis, therefore, try for promotion to the higher planetary systems, but this
cannot free them from death. In this material world, everyone from Brahma to the insignificant ant must die.
Therefore this world is called martya-loka. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.16), abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar
avartino'rjuna: as long as one is within this material world, either on Brahmaloka or on any other loka within this
universe, one must undergo the kala-cakra of one life after another (bhutva bhutva praliyate). But if one returns to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yad gatva na nivartante), one need not reenter the limits of time. Therefore,
devotees who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord can sleep very peacefully with this assurance
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), tyaktva deham punar janma naiti:
after giving up the present body, a devotee who has understood Krsna as He is need not return to this material
world.
The constitutional position for the living entity is eternity (na hanyate hanyamane sarire, nityah sasvato 'yam).
Every living entity is eternal. But because of having fallen into this material world, one wanders within the
universe, continually changing from one body to another. Caitanya Mahaprabhu says:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
Everyone is wandering up and down within this universe, but one who is sufficiently fortunate comes in contact
with Krsna consciousness, by the mercy of the spiritual master, and takes to the path of devotional service. Then
one is assured of eternal life, with no fear of death. When Krsna appears, everyone is freed from fear of death, yet
Devaki felt, "We are still afraid of Kamsa, although You have appeared as our son." She was more or less
bewildered as to why this should be so, and she appealed to the Lord to free her and Vasudeva from this fear.
In this connection, it may be noted that the moon is one of the heavenly planets. From the Vedic literature we
understand that one who goes to the moon receives a life with a duration of ten thousand years in which to enjoy
the fruits of pious activities. If our so-called scientists are going to the moon, why should they come back here? We
must conclude without a doubt that they have never gone to the moon. To go to the moon, one must have the
qualification of pious activities. Then one may go there and live. If one has gone to the moon, why should he
return to this planet, where life is of a very short duration?

My Lord, because You dispel all the fear of Your devotees, I request You to save us and give us protection from
the terrible fear of Kamsa. Your form as Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is appreciated by yogis in
meditation. Please make this form invisible to those who see with material eyes.
The word dhyana-dhisnyam is significant in this verse because the form of Lord Visnu is meditated upon by yogis
(dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah). Devaki requested the Lord, who had appeared as Visnu,
to conceal that form, for she wanted to see the Lord as an ordinary child, like a child appreciated by persons who
have material eyes. Devaki wanted to see whether the Supreme Personality of Godhead had factually appeared or
she was dreaming the Visnu form. If Kamsa were to come, she thought, upon seeing the Visnu form he would
immediately kill the child, but if he saw a human child, he might reconsider. Devaki was afraid of Ugrasena-atmaja;
that is, she was afraid not of Ugrasena and his men, but of the son of Ugrasena. Thus she requested the Lord to
dissipate that fear, since He is always ready to give protection (abhayam) to His devotees. "My Lord," she prayed, "I
request You to save me from the cruel hands of the son of Ugrasena, Kamsa. I am praying to Your Lordship to
please rescue me from this fearful condition because You are always ready to give protection to Your servitors."
The Lord has confirmed this statement in the Bhagavad-gita by assuring Arjuna, "You may declare to the world, My
devotee shall never be vanquished."
While thus praying to the Lord for rescue, mother Devaki expressed her motherly affection: "I understand that
this transcendental form is generally perceived in meditation by the great sages, but I am still afraid because as
soon as Kamsa understands that You have appeared, he might harm You. So I request that for the time being You
become invisible to our material eyes." In other words, she requested the Lord to assume the form of an ordinary
child. "My only cause of fear from my brother Kamsa is due to Your appearance. My Lord Madhusudana, Kamsa
may know that You are already born. Therefore I request You to conceal this four-armed form of Your Lordship,
which holds the four symbols of Visnu--namely the conchshell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. My dear
Lord, at the end of the annihilation of the cosmic manifestation, You put the whole universe within Your abdomen;
still, by Your unalloyed mercy, You have appeared in my womb. I am surprised that You imitate the activities of
ordinary human beings just to please Your devotee."
Devaki was so afraid of Kamsa that she could not believe that Kamsa would be unable to kill Lord Visnu, who
was personally present. Out of motherly affection, therefore, she requested the Supreme Personality of Godhead to
disappear. Although because of the Lord's disappearance Kamsa would harass her more and more, thinking that
the child born of her was hidden somewhere, she did not want the transcendental child to be harassed and killed.
Therefore she requested Lord Visnu to disappear. Later, when harassed, she would think of Him within her mind.

affection for the transcendental child, she believed that Kamsa could kill Him. Instead of thinking of the unlimited
power of the Lord, she thought of the Lord with affection, and therefore she requested the transcendental child to
disappear.

Devaki was thinking of hiding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not handing Him over to Kamsa as she
had all her previous children. Although Vasudeva had promised to hand over every child to Kamsa, this time he
wanted to break his promise and hide the child somewhere. But because of the Lord's appearance in this surprising
four-armed form, He would be impossible to hide.

womb. People will not be able to believe this, and I shall become an object of ridicule.
As explained in Caitanya-caritamrta, loving service to the Personality of Godhead is of two different kinds:
aisvarya-purna, full of opulence, and aisvarya-sithila, without opulence. Real love of Godhead begins with aisvaryasithila,
simply on the basis of pure love.
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
(Brahma-samhita 5.38)
Pure devotees, whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of prema, love, want to see the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as Syamasundara, Muralidhara, with a flute swaying in His two hands. This is the form available to the
inhabitants of Vrndavana, who are all in love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Syamasundara, not as
Lord Visnu, Narayana, who is worshiped in Vaikuntha, where the devotees admire His opulence. Although Devaki
is not on the Vrndavana platform, she is near the Vrndavana platform. On the Vrndavana platform the mother of
Krsna is mother Yasoda, and on the Mathura and Dvaraka platform the mother of Krsna is Devaki. In Mathura and
Dvaraka the love for the Lord is mixed with appreciation of His opulence, but in Vrndavana the opulence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is not exhibited.
There are five stages of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead--santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and
madhurya. Devaki is on the platform of vatsalya. She wanted to deal with her eternal son, Krsna, in that stage of
love, and therefore she wanted the Supreme Personality of Godhead to withdraw His opulent form of Visnu. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura illuminates this fact very clearly in his explanation of this verse.
Bhakti, bhagavan and bhakta do not belong to the material world. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in the spiritual activities of unalloyed devotional service immediately transcends the modes of
material nature and is elevated to the spiritual platform." From the very beginning of one's transactions in bhakti,
one is situated on the transcendental platform. Vasudeva and Devaki, therefore, being situated in a completely pure
devotional state, are beyond this material world and are not subject to material fear. In the transcendental world,
however, because of pure devotion, there is a similar conception of fear, which is due to intense love.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah) and as confirmed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah), without bhakti one cannot understand the spiritual situation of the
Lord. Bhakti may be considered in three stages, called guni-bhuta, pradhani-bhuta and kevala, and according to
these stages there are three divisions, which are called jnana, jnanamayi and rati, or prema--that is, simple
knowledge, love mixed with knowledge, and pure love. By simple knowledge, one can perceive transcendental bliss
without variety. This perception is called mana-bhuti. When one comes to the stage of jnanamayi, one realizes the
transcendental opulences of the Personality of Godhead. But when one reaches pure love, one realizes the
transcendental form of the Lord as Lord Krsna or Lord Rama. This is what is wanted. Especially in the madhuryarasa,
one becomes attached to the Personality of Godhead (sri-vigraha-nistha-rupadi). Then loving transactions
between the Lord and the devotee begin.
The special significance of Krsna's bearing a flute in His hands in Vrajabhumi, Vrndavana, is described as
madhuri. .. virajate. The form of the Lord with a flute in His hands is most attractive, and the one who is most
sublimely attracted is Srimati Radharani, Radhika. She enjoys supremely blissful association with Krsna. Sometimes
people cannot understand why Radhika's name is not mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam. Actually, however,
Radhika can be understood from the word aradhana, which indicates that She enjoys the highest loving affairs with
Krsna.
Not wanting to be ridiculed for having given birth to Visnu, Devaki wanted Krsna, with two hands, and therefore
she requested the Lord to change His form.

sri-bhagavan uvaca

sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said to Devaki; tvam--you; eva--indeed; purva-sarge--in
a previous millennium; abhuh--became; prsnih--by the name Prsni; svayambhuve--the millennium of Svayambhuva
Manu; sati--O supremely chaste; tada--at that time; ayam--Vasudeva; sutapa--Sutapa; nama--by the name;
prajapatih--a Prajapati; akalmasah--a spotlessly pious person.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: My dear mother, best of the chaste, in your previous birth, in the
Svayambhuva millennium, you were known as Prsni, and Vasudeva, who was the most pious Prajapati, was named
Sutapa.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead made it clear that Devaki had not become His mother only now; rather, she
had been His mother previously also. Krsna is eternal, and His selection of a father and mother from among His
devotees takes place eternally. Previously also, Devaki had been the Lord's mother and Vasudeva the Lord's father,
and they were named Prsni and Sutapa. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He accepts His eternal
father and mother, and they accept Krsna as their son. This pastime takes place eternally and is therefore called
nitya-lila. Thus there was no cause for surprise or ridicule. As confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita
(4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body,
take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One should try to understand
the appearance and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic authorities, not from
imagination. One who follows his imaginations about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is condemned.
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
(Bg. 9.11)
The Lord appears as the son of His devotee by His param bhavam. The word bhava refers to the stage of pure
love, which has nothing to do with material transactions.

yuvam vai brahmanadistau

tepathe paramam tapah
yuvam--both of you (Prsni and Sutapa); vai--indeed; brahmana adistau--ordered by Lord Brahma (who is known
as Pitamaha, the father of the Prajapatis); praja-sarge--in the creation of progeny; yada--when; tatah--thereafter;
sanniyamya--keeping under full control; indriya-gramam--the senses; tepathe--underwent; paramam--very great;
tapah--austerity.
When both of you were ordered by Lord Brahma to create progeny, you first underwent severe austerities by
controlling your senses.
Here is an instruction about how to use one's senses to create progeny. According to Vedic principles, before
creating progeny one must fully control the senses. This control takes place through the garbhadhana-samskara. In
India there is great agitation for birth control in various mechanical ways, but birth cannot be mechanically
controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.9), janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam: birth, death, old
age and disease are certainly the primary distresses of the material world. People are trying to control birth, but
they are not able to control death; and if one cannot control death, one cannot control birth either. In other words,
artificially controlling birth is not any more feasible than artificially controlling death.
According to Vedic civilization, procreation should not be contrary to religious principles, and then the birthrate
will be controlled. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo'smi: sex not contrary to
religious principles is a representation of the Supreme Lord. People should be educated in how to give birth to
good children through samskaras, beginning with the garbhadhana-samskara; birth should not be controlled by
artificial means, for this will lead to a civilization of animals. If one follows religious principles, he automatically
practices birth control because if one is spiritually educated he knows that the after-effects of sex are various types
of misery (bahu-duhkha-bhaja). One who is spiritually advanced does not indulge in uncontrolled sex. Therefore,
instead of being forced to refrain from sex or refrain from giving birth to many children, people should be
spiritually educated, and then birth control will automatically follow.
If one is determined to make spiritual advancement, he will not beget a child unless able to make that child a
devotee. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.18), pita na sa syat: one should not become a father unless one is
able to protect his child from mrtyu, the path of birth and death. But where is there education about this? A
responsible father never begets children like cats and dogs. Instead of being encouraged to adopt artificial means of
birth control, people should be educated in Krsna consciousness because only then will they understand their
responsibility to their children. If one can beget children who will be devotees and be taught to turn aside from the
path of birth and death (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani), there is no need of birth control. Rather, one should be
encouraged to beget children. Artificial means of birth control have no value. Whether one begets children or does
not, a population of men who are like cats and dogs will never make human society happy. It is therefore necessary
for people to be educated spiritually so that instead of begetting children like cats and dogs, they will undergo
austerities to produce devotees. This will make their lives successful.

through yoga, and by eating only air and dry leaves fallen from the trees, you cleansed from your minds all dirty
things. In this way, desiring a benediction from Me, you worshiped Me with peaceful minds.
Vasudeva and Devaki did not obtain the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son very easily, nor does the
Supreme Godhead accept merely anyone as His father and mother. Here we can see how Vasudeva and Devaki
obtained Krsna as their eternal son. In our own lives, we are meant to follow the principles indicated herewith for
getting good children. Of course, it is not possible for everyone to get Krsna as his son, but at least one can get very
good sons and daughters for the benefit of human society. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that if human beings do not
follow the spiritual way of life, there will be an increase of varna-sankara population, population begotten like cats
and dogs, and the entire world will become like hell. Not practicing Krsna consciousness but simply encouraging
artificial means to check the population will be futile; the population will increase, and it will consist of varnasankara,
unwanted progeny. It is better to teach people how to beget children not like hogs and dogs, but in
controlled life.
Human life is meant not for becoming a hog or dog, but for tapo divyam, transcendental austerity. Everyone
should be taught to undergo austerity, tapasya. Although it may not be possible to undergo tapasya like that of
Prsni and Sutapa, the sastra has given an opportunity for a method of tapasya very easy to perform--the sankirtana
movement. One cannot expect to undergo tapasya to get Krsna as one's child, yet simply by chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra (kirtanad eva krsnasya), one can become so pure that one becomes free from all the
contamination of this material world (mukta-sangah) and goes back home, back to Godhead (param vrajet). The
Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, is teaching people not to adopt artificial means of happiness, but to take
the real path of happiness as prescribed in the sastra--the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra--and become perfect
in every aspect of material existence.

O sinless mother Devaki, after the expiry of twelve thousand celestial years, in which you constantly
contemplated Me within the core of your heart with great faith, devotion and austerity, I was very much satisfied
with you. Since I am the best of all bestowers of benediction, I appeared in this same form as Krsna to ask you to
take from Me the benediction you desired. You then expressed your desire to have a son exactly like Me.
Twelve thousand years on the celestial planets is not a very long time for those who live in the upper planetary
system, although it may be very long for those who live on this planet. Sutapa was the son of Brahma, and as we
have already understood from Bhagavad-gita (8.17), one day of Brahma equals many millions of years according to
our calculation (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh). We should be careful to understand that to
get Krsna as one's son, one must undergo such great austerities. If we want to get the Supreme Personality of
Godhead to become one of us in this material world, this requires great penance, but if we want to go back to
Krsna (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna), we need only understand Him and love Him. Through
love only, we can very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore declared, prema
pum-artho mahan: love of Godhead is the highest achievement for anyone.
As we have explained, in worship of the Lord there are three stages--jnana, jnanamayi and rati, or love. Sutapa
and his wife, Prsni, inaugurated their devotional activities on the basis of full knowledge. Gradually they developed
love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and when this love was mature, the Lord appeared as Visnu,
although Devaki then requested Him to assume the form of Krsna. To love the Supreme Personality of Godhead
more, we want a form of the Lord like Krsna or Rama. We can engage in loving transactions with Krsna especially.
In this age, we are all fallen, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
bestow upon us love of Godhead directly. This was appreciated by the associates of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Rupa
Gosvami said:
namo maha-vadanyaya
krsna-prema-pradaya te
krsnaya krsna-caitanyanamne
gaura-tvise namah
In this verse, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is described as maha-vadanya, the most munificent of charitable persons,
because He gives Krsna so easily that one can attain Krsna simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. We
should therefore take advantage of the benediction given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and when by chanting the
Hare Krsna mantra we are cleansed of all dirty things (ceto-darpana-marjanam), we shall be able to understand
very easily that Krsna is the only object of love (kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet).
Therefore, one need not undergo severe penances for many thousands of years; one need only learn how to love
Krsna and be always engaged in His service (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah). Then one can
very easily go back home, back to Godhead. Instead of bringing the Lord here for some material purpose, to have a
son or whatever else, if we go back home, back to Godhead, our real relationship with the Lord is revealed, and we
eternally engage in our eternal relationship. By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, we gradually develop our eternal
relationship with the Supreme Person and thus attain the perfection called svarupa-siddhi. We should take
advantage of this benediction and go back home, back to Godhead. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has therefore
sung, patita-pavana-hetu tava avatara: Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared as an incarnation to deliver all fallen souls
like us and directly bestow upon us love of Godhead. We must take advantage of this great benediction of the great
personality of Godhead.

Being husband and wife but always sonless, you were attracted by sexual desires, for by the influence of
devamaya, transcendental love, you wanted to have Me as your son. Therefore you never desired to be liberated
from this material world.
Vasudeva and Devaki had been dam-pati, husband and wife, since the time of Sutapa and Prsni, and they wanted
to remain husband and wife in order to have the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their son. This attachment
came about by the influence of devamaya. Loving Krsna as one's son is a Vedic principle. Vasudeva and Devaki
never desired anything but to have the Lord as their son, yet for this purpose they apparently wanted to live like
ordinary grhasthas for sexual indulgence. Although this was a transaction of spiritual potency, their desire appears
like attachment for sex in conjugal life. If one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one must give up such
desires. This is possible only when one develops intense love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has said:
niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya
param param jigamisor bhava-sagarasya
(Cc. Madhya 11.8)
If one wants to go back home, back to Godhead, one must be niskincana, free from all material desires.
Therefore, instead of desiring to have the Lord come here and become one's son, one should desire to become free
from all material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam) and go back home, back to Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
teaches us in His Siksastaka:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi
"O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire beautiful women, nor do I want any
number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service, birth after birth." One should not ask the Lord
to fulfill any materially tainted desires.

After you received that benediction and I disappeared, you engaged yourselves in sex to have a son like Me, and I

According to the Sanskrit dictionary Amara-kosa, sex life is also called gramya-dharma, material desire, but in
spiritual life this gramya-dharma, the material desire for sex, is not very much appreciated. If one has a tinge of
attachment for the material enjoyments of eating, sleeping, mating and defending, one is not niskincana. But one
really should be niskincana. Therefore, one should be free from the desire to beget a child like Krsna by sexual
enjoyment. This is indirectly hinted at in this verse.

O supremely chaste mother, I, the same personality, have now appeared of you both as your son for the third

The Supreme Personality of Godhead chooses a mother and father from whom to take birth again and again. The
Lord took birth originally from Sutapa and Prsni, then from Kasyapa and Aditi, and again from the same father and
mother, Vasudeva and Devaki. "In other appearances also," the Lord said, "I took the form of an ordinary child just
to become your son so that we could reciprocate eternal love." Jiva Gosvami has explained this verse in his Krsnasandarbha,
Ninety-sixth Chapter, where he notes that in text 37 the Lord says, amuna vapusa, meaning "by this
same form." In other words, the Lord told Devaki, "This time I have appeared in My original form as Sri Krsna."
Srila Jiva Gosvami says that the other forms were partial expansions of the Lord's original form, but because of the
intense love developed by Prsni and Sutapa, the Lord appeared from Devaki and Vasudeva in His full opulence as
Sri Krsna. In this verse the Lord confirms, "I am the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, but I appear in full
opulence as Sri Krsna." This is the purport of the words tenaiva vapusa. When the Lord mentioned the birth of
Prsnigarbha, He did not say tenaiva vapusa, but He assured Devaki that in the third birth the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Krsna had appeared, not His partial expansion. Prsnigarbha and Vamana were partial expansions of
Krsna, but in this third birth Krsna Himself appeared. This is the explanation given in Sri Krsna-sandarbha by Srila
Jiva Gosvami.

I have shown you this form of Visnu just to remind you of My previous births. Otherwise, if I appeared like an
ordinary human child, you would not believe that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, has indeed
appeared.
Devaki did not need to be reminded that the Supreme personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, had appeared as her
son; she already accepted this. Nonetheless, she was anxious, thinking that if her neighbors heard that Visnu had
appeared as her son, none of them would believe it. Therefore she wanted Lord Visnu to transform Himself into a
human child. On the other hand, the Supreme Lord was also anxious, thinking that if He appeared as an ordinary
child, she would not believe that Lord Visnu had appeared. Such are the dealings between devotees and the Lord.
The Lord deals with His devotees exactly like a human being, but this does not mean that the Lord is one of the
human beings, for this is the conclusion of nondevotees (avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam).
Devotees know the Supreme Personality of Godhead under any circumstances. This is the difference between a
devotee and a nondevotee. The Lord says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru: "Engage your
mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances and worship Me." A nondevotee cannot
believe that simply by thinking of one person, one can achieve liberation from this material world and go back
home, back to Godhead. But this is a fact. The Lord comes as a human being, and if one becomes attached to the
Lord on the platform of loving service, one's promotion to the transcendental world is assured.

yuvam--both of you (husband and wife); mam--unto Me; putra-bhavena--as your son; brahma-bhavena--knowing
that I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ca--and; asakrt--constantly; cintayantau--thinking like that; krtasnehau--

Both of you, husband and wife, constantly think of Me as your son, but always know that I am the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. By thus thinking of Me constantly with love and affection, you will achieve the highest
perfection: returning home, back to Godhead.
This instruction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His father and mother, who are eternally connected
with Him, is especially intended for persons eager to return home, back to Godhead. One should never think of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as an ordinary human being, as nondevotees do. Krsna, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, personally appeared and left His instructions for the benefit of all human society, but fools and rascals
unfortunately think of Him as an ordinary human being and twist the instructions of Bhagavad-gita for the
satisfaction of their senses. Practically everyone commenting on Bhagavad-gita interprets it for sense gratification.
It has become especially fashionable for modern scholars and politicians to interpret Bhagavad-gita as if it were
something fictitious, and by their wrong interpretations they are spoiling their own careers and the careers of
others. The Krsna consciousness movement, however, is fighting against this principle of regarding Krsna as a
fictitious person and of accepting that there was no Battle of Kuruksetra, that everything is symbolic, and that
nothing in Bhagavad-gita is true. In any case, if one truly wants to be successful, one can do so by reading the text
of Bhagavad-gita as it is. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu especially stressed the instructions of Bhagavad-gita: yare dekha,
tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa. If one wants to achieve the highest success in life, one must accept Bhagavad-gita as
spoken by the Supreme Lord. By accepting Bhagavad-gita in this way, all of human society can become perfect and
happy.
It is to be noted that because Vasudeva and Devaki would be separated from Krsna when He was carried to
Gokula, the residence of Nanda Maharaja, the Lord personally instructed them that they should always think of
Him as their son and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That would keep them in touch with Him. After
eleven years, the Lord would return to Mathura to be their son, and therefore there was no question of separation.

sri-suka uvaca

babhuva prakrtah sisuh
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; iti uktva--after instructing in this way; asit--remained; harih--the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; tusnim--silent; bhagavan--Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
atma-mayaya--by acting in His own spiritual energy; pitroh sampasyatoh--while His father and mother were
factually seeing Him; sadyah--immediately; babhuva--He became; prakrtah--like an ordinary human being; sisuh--a
child.
Sukadeva Gosvami said: After thus instructing His father and mother, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, remained silent. In their presence, by His internal energy, He then transformed Himself into a small human
child. [In other words, He transformed Himself into His original form: krsnas tu bhagavan svayam.]
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.6), sambhavamy atma-mayaya: whatever is done by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is done by His spiritual energy; nothing is forced upon Him by the material energy. This is the difference
between the Lord and an ordinary living being. The Vedas say:
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8)
It is natural for the Lord to be untinged by material qualities, and because everything is perfectly present in His
spiritual energy, as soon as He desires something, it is immediately done. The Lord is not a prakrta-sisu, a child of
this world, but by His personal energy He appeared like one. Ordinary people may have difficulty accepting the
supreme controller, God, as a human being because they forget that He can do everything by spiritual energy
(atma-mayaya). Nonbelievers say, "How can the supreme controller descend as an ordinary being?" This sort of
thinking is materialistic. Srila Jiva Gosvami says that unless we accept the energy of the Supreme personality of
Godhead as inconceivable, beyond the conception of our words and mind, we cannot understand the Supreme
Lord. Those who doubt that the Supreme personality of Godhead can come as a human being and turn Himself
into a human child are fools who think that Krsna's body is material, that He is born and that He therefore also
dies.
In Srimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto, Fourth Chapter, verses 28 and 29, there is a description of Krsna's leaving
His body. Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami, "When all the members of the Yadu dynasty met
their end, Krsna also put an end to Himself, and the only member of the family who remained alive was Uddhava.
How was this possible?" Sukadeva Gosvami answered that Krsna, by His own energy, destroyed the entire family
and then thought of making His own body disappear. In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described how the
Lord gave up His body. But this was not the destruction of Krsna's body; rather, it was the disappearance of the
Supreme Lord by His personal energy.
Actually, the Lord does not give up His body, which is eternal, but as He can change His body from the form of
Visnu to that of an ordinary human child, He can change His body to any form He likes. This does not mean that
He gives up His body. By spiritual energy, the Lord can appear in a body made of wood or stone. He can change His
body into anything because everything is His energy (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). As clearly said in
Bhagavad-gita (7.4), bhinna prakrtir astadha: the material elements are separated energies of the Supreme Lord. If
He transforms Himself into the arca-murti, the worshipable Deity, which we see as stone or wood, He is still Krsna.
Therefore the sastra warns, arcye visnau sila-dhir gurusu nara-matih. One who thinks that the worshipable Deity in
the temple is made of wood or stone, one who sees a Vaisnava guru as an ordinary human being, or one who
materially conceives of a Vaisnava as belonging to a particular caste is naraki, a resident of hell. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead can appear before us in many forms, as he likes, but we must know the true facts: janma
karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah (Bg. 4.9). By following the instructions of sadhu, guru and sastra--the
saintly persons, the spiritual master and the authoritative scriptures--one can understand Krsna, and then one
makes his life successful by returning home, back to Godhead.

Thereafter, exactly when Vasudeva, being inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was about to take the
newborn child from the delivery room, Yogamaya, the Lord's spiritual energy, took birth as the daughter of the
wife of Maharaja Nanda.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura discusses that Krsna appeared simultaneously as the son of Devaki and as
the son of Yasoda, along with the spiritual energy Yogamaya. As the son of Devaki, He first appeared as Visnu, and
because Vasudeva was not in the position of pure affection for Krsna, Vasudeva worshiped his son as Lord Visnu.
Yasoda, however, pleased her son Krsna without understanding His Godhood. This is the difference between Krsna
as the son of Yasoda and as the son of Devaki. This is explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti on the authority of Harivamsa.

By the influence of Yogamaya, all the doorkeepers fell fast asleep, their senses unable to work, and the other
inhabitants of the house also fell deeply asleep. When the sun rises, the darkness automatically disappears;
similarly, when Vasudeva appeared, the closed doors, which were strongly pinned with iron and locked with iron
chains, opened automatically. Since the clouds in the sky were mildly thundering and showering, Ananta-naga, an
expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, followed Vasudeva, beginning from the door, with hoods
expanded to protect Vasudeva and the transcendental child.
Sesa-naga is an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead whose business is to serve the Lord with all
necessary paraphernalia. When Vasudeva was carrying the child, Sesa-naga came to serve the Lord and protect Him
from the mild showers of rain.

to his residence, the prison house of Kamsa.
Vasudeva knew very well that as soon as the daughter was in the prison house of Kamsa, Kamsa would
immediately kill her; but to protect his own child, he had to kill the child of his friend. Nanda Maharaja was his
friend, but out of deep affection and attachment for his own son, he knowingly did this. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that one cannot be blamed for protecting one's own child at the sacrifice of another's. Furthermore,
Vasudeva cannot be accused of callousness, since his actions were impelled by the force of Yogamaya.

Exhausted by the labor of childbirth, Yasoda was overwhelmed with sleep and unable to understand what kind of
child had been born to her.
Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva were intimate friends, and so were their wives, Yasoda and Devaki. Although their
names were different, they were practically nondifferent personalities. The only difference is that Devaki was able
to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had been born to her and had now changed into Krsna,
whereas Yasoda was not able to understand what kind of child had been born to her. Yasoda was such an advanced
devotee that she never regarded Krsna as the Supreme personality of Godhead, but simply loved Him as her own
child. Devaki, however, knew from the very beginning that although Krsna was her son, He was the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In Vrndavana, no one regarded Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When
something very wonderful happened because of Krsna's activities, the inhabitants of Vrndavana--the cowherd men,
the cowherd boys, Nanda Maharaja, Yasoda and the others--were surprised, but they never considered their son
Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes they suggested that some great demigod had appeared there
as Krsna. In such an exalted status of devotional service, a devotee forgets the position of Krsna and intensely loves
the Supreme Personality of Godhead without understanding His position. This is called kevala-bhakti and is
distinct from the stages of jnana and jnanamayi bhakti.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Birth of Lord Krsna."
Chapter Four
The Atrocities of King Kamsa
This chapter describes how Kamsa, following the advice of his demoniac friends, considered the persecution of
small children to be very diplomatic.
After Vasudeva bound himself with iron shackles as before, all the doors of the prison house closed by the
influence of Yogamaya, who then began crying as a newborn child, This crying awakened the doorkeepers, who
immediately informed Kamsa that a child had been born to Devaki. Upon hearing this news, Kamsa appeared with
great force in the maternity room, and in spite of Devaki's pleas that the child be saved, the demon forcibly
snatched the child from Devaki's hands and dashed the child against a rock. Unfortunately for Kamsa, however, the
newborn child slipped away from his hands, rose above his head and appeared as the eight-armed form of Durga.
Durga then told Kamsa, "The enemy you contemplate has taken birth somewhere else. Therefore your plan to
persecute all the children will prove futile."
According to the prophecy, the eighth child of Devaki would kill Kamsa, and therefore when Kamsa saw that the
eighth child was a female and heard that his so-called enemy had taken birth elsewhere, he was struck with
wonder. He decided to release Devaki and Vasudeva, and he admitted before them the wrongness of his atrocities.
Falling at the feet of Devaki and Vasudeva, he begged their pardon and tried to convince them that because the
events that had taken place were destined to happen, they should not be unhappy for his having killed so many of
their children. Devaki and Vasudeva, being naturally very pious, immediately excused Kamsa for his atrocities, and
Kamsa, after seeing that his sister and brother-in-law were happy, returned to his home.
After the night passed, however, Kamsa called for his ministers and informed them of all that had happened. The
ministers, who were all demons, advised Kamsa that because his enemy had already taken birth somewhere else, all
the children born within the past ten days in the villages within Kamsa's kingdom should be killed. Although the
demigods always feared Kamsa, they should not be treated leniently; since they were enemies, Kamsa should try his
best to uproot their existence. The demoniac ministers further advised that Kamsa and the demons continue their
enmity toward Visnu because Visnu is the original person among all the demigods. The brahmanas, the cows, the
Vedas, austerity, truthfulness, control of the senses and mind, faithfulness and mercy are among the different parts
of the body of Visnu, who is the origin of all the demigods, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Therefore, the
ministers advised, the demigods, the saintly persons, the cows and the brahmanas should be systematically
persecuted. Strongly advised in this way by his friends, the demoniac ministers, Kamsa approved of their
instructions and considered it beneficial to be envious of the brahmanas. Following Kamsa's orders, therefore, the
demons began committing their atrocities all over Vrajabhumi.

Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King Pariksit, the doors inside and outside the house closed as before.
Thereafter, the inhabitants of the house, especially the watchmen, heard the crying of the newborn child and thus
awakened from their beds.
The activities of Yogamaya are distinctly visible in this chapter, in which Devaki and Vasudeva excuse Kamsa for
his many devious, atrocious activities and Kamsa becomes repentant and falls at their feet. Before the awakening of
the watchmen and the others in the prison house, many other things happened. Krsna was born and transferred to
the home of Yasoda in Gokula, the strong doors opened and again closed, and Vasudeva resumed his former
condition of being shackled. The watchmen, however, could not understand all this. They awakened only when
they heard the crying of the newborn child, Yogamaya.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has remarked that the watchmen were just like dogs. At night the dogs in
the street act like watchmen. If one dog barks, many other dogs immediately follow it by barking. Although the
street dogs are not appointed by anyone to act as watchmen, they think they are responsible for protecting the
neighborhood, and as soon as someone unknown enters it, they all begin to bark. Both Yogamaya and Mahamaya
act in all material activities (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah), but although the energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead acts under the Supreme Lord's direction (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram),
doglike watchmen such as politicians and diplomats think that they are protecting their neighborhoods
from the dangers of the outside world. These are the actions of maya. But one who surrenders to Krsna is relieved
of the protection afforded by the dogs and doglike guardians of this material world.

Kamsa immediately got up from bed, thinking, "Here is Kala, the supreme time factor, which has taken birth to
kill me!" Thus overwhelmed, Kamsa, his hair scattered on his head, at once approached the place where the child
had been born.
The word kalah is significant. Although the child was born to kill Kamsa, Kamsa thought that this was the proper
time to kill the child so that he himself would be saved. Kala is actually another name of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead when He appears only for the purpose of killing. When Arjuna inquired from Krsna in His universal
form, "Who are You?" the Lord presented Himself as kala, death personified to kill. By nature's law, when there is
an unwanted increase in population, kala appears, and by some arrangement of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, people are killed wholesale in different ways, by war, pestilence, famine and so on. At that time, even
atheistic political leaders go to a church, mosque or temple for protection by God or gods and submissively say,
"God willing." Before that, they pay no attention to God, not caring to know God or His will, but when kala
appears, they say, "God willing." Death is but another feature of the supreme kala, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. At the time of death, the atheist must submit to this supreme kala, and then the Supreme Personality of
Godhead takes away all his possessions (mrtyuh sarva-haras caham) and forces him to accept another body (tatha
dehantara-praptih). This the atheists do not know, and if they do know, they neglect it so that they may go on with
their normal life. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to teach them that although for a few years one may
act as a great protector or great watchman, with the appearance of kala, death, one must take another body by the
laws of nature. Not knowing this, they unnecessarily waste their time in their occupation as watchdogs and do not
try to get the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is clearly said, aprapya mam nivartante mrtyusamsara-
vartmani: without Krsna consciousness, one is condemned to continue wandering in birth and death, not
knowing what will happen in one's next birth.

Devaki helplessly, piteously appealed to Kamsa: My dear brother, all good fortune unto you. Don't kill this girl.
She will be your daughter-in-law. Indeed, it is unworthy of you to kill a woman.
Kamsa had previously excused Devaki because he thought that a woman should not be killed, especially when
pregnant. But now, by the influence of maya, he was prepared to kill a woman--not only a woman, but a small,
helpless newborn child. Devaki wanted to save her brother from this terrible, sinful act. Therefore she told him,
"Don't be so atrocious as to kill a female child. Let there be all good fortune for you." Demons can do anything for
their personal benefit, not considering what is pious or vicious. But Devaki, on the contrary, although safe because
she had already given birth to her own son, Krsna, was anxious to save the daughter of someone else. This was
natural for her.

My dear brother, by the influence of destiny you have already killed many babies, each of them as bright and
beautiful as fire. But kindly spare this daughter. Give her to me as your gift.
Here we see that Devaki first focused Kamsa's attention on his atrocious activities, his killing of her many sons.
Then she wanted to compromise with him by saying that whatever he had done was not his fault, but was ordained
by destiny. Then she appealed to him to give her the daughter as a gift. Devaki was the daughter of a ksatriya and
knew how to play the political game. In politics there are different methods of achieving success: first repression
(dama), then compromise (sama), and then asking for a gift (dana). Devaki first adopted the policy of repression
by directly attacking Kamsa for having cruelly, atrociously killed her babies. Then she compromised by saying that
this was not his fault, and then she begged for a gift. As we learn from the history of the Mahabharata, or "Greater
India," the wives and daughters of the ruling class, the ksatriyas, knew the political game, but we never find that a
woman was given the post of chief executive. This is in accordance with the injunctions of Manu-samhita, but
unfortunately Manu-samhita is now being insulted, and the Aryans, the members of Vedic society, cannot do
anything. Such is the nature of Kali-yuga.
Nothing happens unless ordained by destiny.
tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido
na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah
tal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham
kalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa
(Bhag. 1.5.18)
Devaki knew very well that because the killing of her many children had been ordained by destiny, Kamsa was
not to be blamed. There was no need to give good instructions to Kamsa. Upadeso hi murkhanam prakopaya na
santaye (Canakya Pandita). If a foolish person is given good instructions, he becomes more and more angry.
Moreover, a cruel person is more dangerous than a snake. A snake and a cruel person are both cruel, but a cruel
person is more dangerous because although a snake can be charmed by mantras or subdued by herbs, a cruel
person cannot be subdued by any means. Such was the nature of Kamsa.

Although Devaki was crying like a very poor woman, actually she was not poor, and therefore the word used here
is dinavat. She had already given birth to Krsna. Therefore, who could have been richer than she? Even the
demigods had come to offer prayers to Devaki, but she played the part of a poor, piteously afflicted woman because
she wanted to save the daughter of Yasoda.

The child, Yogamaya-devi, the younger sister of Lord Visnu, slipped upward from Kamsa's hands and appeared in
the sky as Devi, the goddess Durga, with eight arms, completely equipped with weapons.
Kamsa tried to dash the child downward against a piece of stone, but since she was Yogamaya, the younger sister
of Lord Visnu, she slipped upward and assumed the form of the goddess Durga. The word anuja, meaning "the
younger sister," is significant. When Visnu, or Krsna, took birth from Devaki, He must have simultaneously taken
birth from Yasoda also. Otherwise how could Yogamaya have been anuja, the Lord's younger sister?

After speaking to Kamsa in this way, the goddess Durga, Yogamaya, appeared in different places, such as
Varanasi, and became celebrated by different names, such as Annapurna, Durga, Kali and Bhadra.
The goddess Durga is celebrated in Calcutta as Kali, in Bombay as Mumbadevi, in Varanasi as Annapurna, in
Cuttack as Bhadrakali and in Ahmedabad as Bhadra. Thus in different places she is known by different names. Her
devotees are known as saktas, or worshipers of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas
worshipers of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself are called Vaisnavas. Vaisnavas are destined to return
home, back to Godhead, in the spiritual world, whereas the saktas are destined to live within this material world to
enjoy different types of material happiness. In the material world, the living entity must accept different types of
bodies. Bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya (Bg. 18.61). According to the living entity's desire,
Yogamaya, or Maya, the goddess Durga, gives him a particular type of body, which is mentioned as yantra, a
machine. But the living entities who are promoted to the spiritual world do not return to the prison house of a
material body (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so'rjuna). The words janma na eti indicate that these
living entities remain in their original, spiritual bodies to enjoy the company of the Supreme personality of
Godhead in the transcendental abodes Vaikuntha and Vrndavana.

After hearing the words of the goddess Durga, Kamsa was struck with wonder. Thus he approached his sister
Devaki and brother-in-law Vasudeva, released them immediately from their shackles, and very humbly spoke as
follows.
Kamsa was astonished because the goddess Durga had become the daughter of Devaki. Since Devaki was a
human being, how could the goddess Durga become her daughter? This was one cause of his astonishment. Also,
how is it that the eighth child of Devaki was a female? This also astonished him. Asuras are generally devotees of
mother Durga, Sakti, or of demigods, especially Lord Siva. The appearance of Durga in her original eight-armed
feature, holding various weapons, immediately changed Kamsa's mind about Devaki's being an ordinary human.
Devaki must have had some transcendental qualities; otherwise why would the goddess Durga have taken birth
from her womb? Under the circumstances, Kamsa, struck with wonder, wanted to compensate for his atrocities
against his sister Devaki.

do. At the present moment in Kali-yuga, Raksasa fathers and mothers are killing their own children in the womb,
and some are even eating the fetus with great relish. Thus the so-called civilization is gradually advancing by

Kamsa addressed his sister and brother-in-law as maha-bhagau because although he killed their ordinary
children, the goddess Durga took birth from them. Because Devaki bore Durgadevi in her womb, Kamsa praised
both Devaki and her husband. Asuras are very devoted to the goddess Durga, Kali and so forth. Kamsa, therefore,
truly astonished, appreciated the exalted position of his sister and brother-in-law. Durga is certainly not under the
laws of nature, because she herself is the controller of the laws of nature. Ordinary living beings, however, are
controlled by these laws (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah). Consequently, none of us are allowed to
live together for any long period. By speaking in this way, Kamsa tried to pacify his sister and brother-in-law.

elements); viparyeti--is changed or broken; yatha--as; eva--certainly; bhuh--the earth.
In this world, we can see that pots, dolls and other products of the earth appear, break and then disappear,
mixing with the earth. Similarly, the bodies of all conditioned living entities are annihilated, but the living entities,
like the earth itself, are unchanging and never annihilated [na hanyate hanyamane sarire].
Although Kamsa is described as a demon, he had good knowledge of the affairs of atma-tattva, the truth of the
self. Five thousand years ago, there were kings like Kamsa, who is described as an asura, but he was better than
modern politicians and diplomats, who have no knowledge about atma-tattva. As stated in the Vedas, asango hy
ayam purusah: the spirit soul has no connection with the changes of the material body. The body undergoes six
changes--birth, growth, sustenance, by-products, dwindling and then annihilation--but the soul undergoes no such
changes. Even after the annihilation of a particular bodily form, the original source of the bodily elements does not
change. The living entity enjoys the material body, which appears and disappears, but the five elements earth,
water, fire, air and ether remain the same. The example given here is that pots and dolls are produced from the
earth, and when broken or destroyed they mingle with their original ingredients. In any case, the source of supply
remains the same.
As already discussed, the body is made according to the desires of the soul. The soul desires, and thus the body is
formed. Krsna therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities,
who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." Neither the Supersoul, Paramatma, nor the
individual soul changes its original, spiritual identity. The atma does not undergo birth, death or changes like the
body. Therefore a Vedic aphorism says, asango hy ayam purusah: although the soul is conditioned within this
material world, he has no connections with the changes of the material body.

One who does not understand the constitutional position of the body and the soul [atma] becomes too attached
to the bodily concept of life. Consequently, because of attachment to the body and its by-products, he feels affected
by union with and separation from his family, society and nation. As long as this continues, one continues his
material life. [Otherwise, one is liberated.]
As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6):
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
The word dharma means "engagement." One who is engaged in the service of the Lord (yato bhaktir adhoksaje),
without impediment and without cessation, is understood to be situated in his original, spiritual status. When one
is promoted to this status, one is always happy in transcendental bliss. Otherwise, as long as one is in the bodily
concept of life, one must suffer material conditions. Janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam. The body
is subject to its own principles of birth, death, old age and disease, but one who is situated in spiritual life (yato
bhaktir adhoksaje) has no birth, no death, no old age and no disease. One may argue that we may see a person who
is spiritually engaged twenty-four hours a day but is still suffering from disease. In fact, however, he is neither
suffering nor diseased; otherwise he could not be engaged twenty-four hours a day in spiritual activities. The
example may be given in this connection that sometimes dirty foam or garbage is seen floating on the water of the
Ganges. This is called nira-dharma, a function of the water. But one who goes to the Ganges does not mind the
foam and dirty things floating in the water. With his hand, he pushes away such nasty things, bathes in the Ganges
and gains the beneficial results. Therefore, one who is situated in the spiritual status of life is unaffected by foam
and garbage--or any superficial dirty things. This is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"A person acting in the service of Krsna with his body, mind and words is a liberated person, even within the
material world." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.187) Therefore, one is forbidden to regard the guru as an ordinary
human being (gurusu nara-matir. .. naraki sah). The spiritual master, or acarya, is always situated in the spiritual
status of life. Birth, death, old age and disease do not affect him. According to the Hari-bhakti-vilasa, therefore,
after the disappearance of an acarya, his body is never burnt to ashes, for it is a spiritual body. The spiritual body is
always unaffected by material conditions.

My dear sister Devaki, all good fortune unto you. Everyone suffers and enjoys the results of his own work under
the control of providence. Therefore, although your sons have unfortunately been killed by me, please do not
lament for them.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.54):
yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karmabandhanurupa-
phala-bhajanam atanoti
karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Everyone, beginning from the small insect known as indra-gopa up to Indra, the King of the heavenly planets, is
obliged to undergo the results of his fruitive activities. We may superficially see that one is suffering or enjoying
because of some external causes, but the real cause is one's own fruitive activities. Even when someone kills
someone else, it is to be understood that the person who was killed met the fruitive results of his own work and
that the man who killed him acted as the agent of material nature. Thus Kamsa begged Devaki's pardon by
analyzing the matter deeply. He was not the cause of the death of Devaki's sons. Rather, this was their own destiny.
Under the circumstances, Devaki should excuse Kamsa and forget his past deeds without lamentation. Kamsa
admitted his own fault, but whatever he had done was under the control of providence. Kamsa might have been the
immediate cause for the death of Devaki's sons, but the remote cause was their past deeds. This was an actual fact.

In the bodily conception of life, one remains in darkness, without self-realization, thinking, "I am being killed" or
"I have killed my enemies." As long as a foolish person thus considers the self to be the killer or the killed, he
continues to be responsible for material obligations, and consequently he suffers the reactions of happiness and
distress.
By the grace of the Lord, Kamsa felt sincere regret for having unnecessarily persecuted such Vaisnavas as Devaki
and Vasudeva, and thus he came to the transcendental stage of knowledge. "Because I am situated on the platform
of knowledge," Kamsa said, "understanding that I am not at all the killer of your sons, I have no responsibility for
their death. As long as I thought that I would be killed by your son, I was in ignorance, but now I am free from this
ignorance, which was due to a bodily conception of life." As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.17):

"One who is not motivated by false ego, whose intelligence is not entangled, though he kills men in this world, is
not the slayer. Nor is he bound by his actions." According to this axiomatic truth, Kamsa pleaded that he was not
responsible for having killed the sons of Devaki and Vasudeva. "Please try to excuse me for such false, external
activities," he said, "and be pacified with this same knowledge."

Kamsa begged, "My dear sister and brother-in-law, please be merciful to such a poor-hearted person as me, since
both of you are saintly persons. Please excuse my atrocities." Having said this, Kamsa fell at the feet of Vasudeva
and Devaki, his eyes full of tears of regret.
Although Kamsa had spoken very nicely on the subject of real knowledge, his past deeds were abominable and
atrocious, and therefore he further begged forgiveness from his sister and brother-in-law by falling at their feet and
admitting that he was a most sinful person.

When Devaki saw her brother actually repentant while explaining ordained events, she was relieved of all anger.
Similarly, Vasudeva was also free from anger. Smiling, he spoke to Kamsa as follows.
Devaki and Vasudeva, both highly elevated personalities, accepted the truth presented by Kamsa that everything
is ordained by providence. According to the prophecy, Kamsa would be killed by the eighth child of Devaki.
Therefore, Vasudeva and Devaki saw that behind all these incidents was a great plan devised by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Because the Lord had already taken birth, just like a human child, and was in the safe
custody of Yasoda, everything was happening according to plan, and there was no need to continue their ill feeling
toward Kamsa. Thus they accepted Kamsa's words.

O great personality Kamsa, only by the influence of ignorance does one accept the material body and bodily ego.
What you have said about this philosophy is correct. Persons in the bodily concept of life, lacking self-realization,
differentiate in terms of "This is mine" and "This belongs to another."
Everything is done automatically by the laws of nature, which work under the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. There is no question of doing anything independently, for one who has put himself in this
material atmosphere is fully under the control of nature's laws. Our main business, therefore, should be to get out
of this conditioned life and again become situated in spiritual existence. Only due to ignorance does a person
think, "I am a demigod," "I am a human being," "I am a dog," "I am a cat," or, when the ignorance is still further
advanced, "I am God." Unless one is fully self-realized, one's life of ignorance will continue.

anvitah--endowed with; mithah--one another; ghnantam--engaged in killing; na pasyanti--do not see; bhavaih--
because of such differentiation; bhavam--the situation in relation to the Supreme Lord; prthak-drsah--persons who
see everything as separate from the control of the Lord.
Persons with the vision of differentiation are imbued with the material qualities lamentation, jubilation, fear,
envy, greed, illusion and madness. They are influenced by the immediate cause, which they are busy counteracting,
because they have no knowledge of the remote, supreme cause, the Personality of Godhead.
Krsna is the cause of all causes (sarva-karana-karanam), but one who has no connection with Krsna is disturbed
by immediate causes and cannot restrain his vision of separation or differences. When an expert physician treats a
patient, he tries to find the original cause of the disease and is not diverted by the symptoms of that original cause.
Similarly, a devotee is never disturbed by reverses in life. Tat te 'nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag. 10.14.8). A
devotee understands that when he is in distress, this is due to his own past misdeeds, which are now accruing
reactions, although by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead these are only very slight. Karmani
nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam (Brahma-samhita 5.54). When a devotee under the protection of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is to suffer because of faults in his past deeds, he passes through only a little misery by the
grace of the Lord. Although the disease of a devotee is due to mistakes committed sometime in the past, he agrees
to suffer and tolerate such miseries, and he depends fully on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he is never
affected by material conditions of lamentation, jubilation, fear and so on. A devotee never sees anything to be
unconnected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila Madhvacarya, quoting from the Bhavisya Purana,
says:

After that night passed, Kamsa summoned his ministers and informed them of all that had been spoken by
Yogamaya [who had revealed that He who was to slay Kamsa had already been born somewhere else].
The Vedic scripture Candi describes maya, the energy of the Supreme Lord, as nidra: durga devi sarva-bhutesu
nidra-rupena samasthitah. The energy of Yogamaya and Mahamaya keeps the living entities sleeping in this
material world in the great darkness of ignorance. Yogamaya, the goddess Durga, kept Kamsa in darkness about
Krsna's birth and misled him to believe that his enemy Krsna had been born elsewhere. Krsna was born the son of
Devaki, but according to the Lord's original plan, as prophesied to Brahma, He went to Vrndavana to give pleasure
to mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja and other intimate friends and devotees for eleven years. Then He would
return to kill Kamsa. Because Kamsa did not know this, he believed Yogamaya's statement that Krsna was born
elsewhere, not of Devaki.

Those who are devotees of Lord Visnu, Krsna, are suras, or devas, whereas those who are opposed to the devotees
are called asuras. Devotees are expert in all transactions (yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra
samasate surah). Therefore they are called kovida, which means "expert." Asuras, however, although superficially
showing expertise in passionate activities, are actually all fools. They are neither sober nor expert. Whatever they
do is imperfect. Moghasa mogha-karmanah. According to this description of the asuras given in Bhagavad-gita
(9.12), whatever they do will ultimately be baffled. It was such persons who advised Kamsa because they were his
chief friends and ministers.

because of fear, or is unwilling to fight, he is not to be killed. Kamsa's ministers reminded Kamsa that despite his
power, he was cognizant of the principles of fighting, and therefore he had excused the demigods because of their
incapability. "But the present emergency," the ministers said, "is not intended for such mercy or military etiquette.
Now you should prepare to fight under any circumstances." Thus they advised Kamsa to give up the traditional

When we offer our obeisances to the Personality of Godhead, we say:

When Krsna comes to establish real perfection in the social order, He personally gives protection to the cows and
the brahmanas (go-brahmana-hitaya ca). This is His first interest because without protection of the brahmanas and
the cows, there can be no human civilization and no question of happy, peaceful life. Asuras, therefore, are always
interested in killing the brahmanas and cows. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, cows are being killed all over the
world, and as soon as there is a movement to establish brahminical civilization, people in general rebel. Thus they
regard the Krsna consciousness movement as a form of "brainwashing." How can such envious persons be happy in
their godless civilization? The Supreme Personality of Godhead punishes them by keeping them in darkness, birth
after birth, and pushing them lower and lower into wretched conditions of hellish life. The Krsna consciousness
movement has started a brahminical civilization, but especially when it is introduced in the Western countries, the
asuras try to impede it in many ways. Nonetheless, we must push forward this movement tolerantly for the benefit

Lord Visnu, the Supersoul within the core of everyone's heart, is the ultimate enemy of the asuras and is therefore
known as asura-dvit. He is the leader of all the demigods because all the demigods, including Lord Siva and Lord
Brahma, exist under His protection. The great saintly persons, sages and Vaisnavas also depend upon Him. To
persecute the Vaisnavas, therefore, is the only way to kill Visnu.
The demigods and the Vaisnavas especially are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, Visnu, because they are
always obedient to His orders (om tad visnoh paramam padam sada pasyanti surayah). The demoniac followers of
Kamsa thought that if the Vaisnavas, saintly persons and sages were persecuted, the original body of Visnu would
naturally be destroyed. Thus they decided to suppress Vaisnavism. The asuras perpetually struggle to persecute the
Vaisnavas because they do not want Vaisnavism to spread. Vaisnavas preach only devotional service, not
encouraging karmis, jnanis and yogis, because if one must liberate oneself from material, conditional life, one must
ultimately become a Vaisnava. Our Krsna consciousness movement is directed with this understanding, and
therefore the asuras always try to suppress it.

sri-suka uvaca

sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam--in this way; durmantribhih--his bad ministers; kamsah--King
Kamsa; saha--along with; sammantrya--after considering very elaborately; durmatih--without good intelligence;
brahma-himsam--persecution of the brahmanas; hitam--as the best way; mene--accepted; kala-pasa-avrtah--being
bound by the rules and regulations of Yamaraja; asurah--because he was a demon.
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thus, having considered the instructions of his bad ministers, Kamsa, who was
bound by the laws of Yamaraja and devoid of good intelligence because he was a demon, decided to persecute the
saintly persons, the brahmanas, as the only way to achieve his own good fortune.
Srila Locana dasa Thakura has sung, apana karama, bhunjaye samana, kahaye locana dasa. Instead of taking good
instructions from the sages and the sastras, godless nondevotees act whimsically, according to their own plans.
Actually, however, no one has his own plans because everyone is bound by the laws of nature and must act
according to his tendency in material, conditional life. Therefore one must change one's own decision and follow
the decision of Krsna and Krsna's devotees. Then one is rescued from punishment by Yamaraja. Kamsa was not
uneducated. It appears from his talks with Vasudeva and Devaki that he knew all about the laws of nature. But
because of his association with bad ministers, he could not make a clear decision about his welfare. Therefore the
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.54) says:
'sadhu-sanga,' 'sadhu-sanga'----sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sasge sarva-siddhi haya
If one desires his real welfare, he must associate with devotees and saintly persons and in this way rectify the
material condition of his life.

"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly
passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." Irresponsible
persons, surcharged with passion and ignorance, foolishly do things that are not to be done (nunam pramattah

Chapter Five
The Meeting of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva
As described in this chapter, Nanda Maharaja very gorgeously performed the birth ceremony for his newborn
child. Then he went to Kamsa to pay taxes due and met his intimate friend Vasudeva.
There was great jubilation all over Vrndavana due to Krsna's birth. Everyone was overwhelmed with joy.
Therefore the King of Vraja, Maharaja Nanda, wanted to perform the birth ceremony for his child, and this he did.
During this great festival, Nanda Maharaja gave in charity to all present whatever they desired. After the festival,
Nanda Maharaja put the cowherd men in charge of protecting Gokula, and then he went to Mathura to pay official
taxes to Kamsa. In Mathura, Nanda Maharaja met Vasudeva. Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva were brothers, and
Vasudeva praised Nanda Maharaja's good fortune because he knew that Krsna had accepted Nanda Maharaja as His
father. When Vasudeva inquired from Nanda Maharaja about the welfare of the child, Nanda Maharaja informed
him all about Vrndavana, and Vasudeva was very much satisfied by this, although he expressed his grief because
Devaki's many children had been killed by Kamsa. Nanda Maharaja consoled Vasudeva by saying that everything
happens according to destiny and that one who knows this is not aggrieved. Expecting many disturbances in
Gokula, Vasudeva then advised Nanda Maharaja not to wait in Mathura, but to return to Vrndavana as soon as
possible. Thus Nanda Maharaja took leave of Vasudeva and returned to Vrndavana with the other cowherd men on
their bullock carts.

the Vedic regulations; pitr-deva-arcanam--the worship of the forefathers and the demigods; tatha--as well as.
Sukadeva Gosvami said: Nanda Maharaja was naturally very magnanimous, and when Lord Sri Krsna appeared as
his son, he was overwhelmed by jubilation. Therefore, after bathing and purifying himself and dressing himself
properly, he invited brahmanas who knew how to recite Vedic mantras. After having these qualified brahmanas
recite auspicious Vedic hymns, he arranged to have the Vedic birth ceremony celebrated for his newborn child
according to the rules and regulations, and he also arranged for worship of the demigods and forefathers.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has discussed the significance of the words nandas tu. The word tu, he says,
is not used to fulfill the sentence, because without tu the sentence is complete. Therefore the word tu is used for a
different purpose. Although Krsna appeared as the son of Devaki, Devaki and Vasudeva did not enjoy the jatakarma,
the festival of the birth ceremony. Instead, this ceremony was enjoyed by Nanda Maharaja, as stated here
(nandas tv atmaja utpanne jatahlado maha-manah). When Nanda Maharaja met Vasudeva, Vasudeva could not
disclose, "Your son Krsna is actually my son. You are His father in a different way, spiritually." Because of fear of
Kamsa, Vasudeva could not observe the festival for Krsna's birth, Nanda Maharaja, however, took full advantage of
this opportunity.
The jata-karma ceremony can take place when the umbilical cord, connecting the child and the placenta, is cut.
However, since Krsna was brought by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Maharaja, where was the chance for this to
happen? In this regard, Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura desires to prove with evidence from many sastras that
Krsna actually took birth as the son of Yasoda before the birth of Yogamaya, who is therefore described as the
Lord's younger sister. Even though there may be doubts about the cutting of the umbilical cord, and even though it
is possible that this was not done, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, such events are regarded as
factual. Krsna appeared as Varahadeva from the nostril of Brahma, and therefore Brahma is described as the father
of Varahadeva. Also significant are the words karayam asa vidhivat. Being overwhelmed with jubilation over the
birth of his son, Nanda Maharaja did not see whether the cord was cut or not. Thus he performed the ceremony
very gorgeously. According to the opinion of some authorities, Krsna was actually born as the son of Yasoda. In any
case, without regard for material understandings, we can accept that Nanda Maharaja's celebration for the
ceremony of Krsna's birth was proper. This ceremony is therefore well known everywhere as Nandotsava.

O King, by the passing of time, land and other material possessions are purified; by bathing, the body is purified;
and by being cleansed, unclean things are purified. By purificatory ceremonies, birth is purified; by austerity, the
senses are purified; and by worship and charity offered to the brahmanas, material possessions are purified. By
satisfaction, the mind is purified; and by self-realization, or Krsna consciousness, the soul is purified.
These are sastric injunctions concerning how one can purify everything according to Vedic civilization. Unless
purified, anything we use will infect us with contamination. In India five thousand years ago, even in the villages
such as that of Nanda Maharaja, people knew know to purify things, and thus they enjoyed even material life
without contamination.

The cows, the bulls and the calves were thoroughly smeared with a mixture of turmeric and oil, mixed with

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has instructed in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisyakarma-
svabhavajam: "Farming, cow protection and trade are the qualities of work for the vaisyas." Nanda Maharaja
belonged to the vaisya community, the agriculturalist community. How to protect the cows and how rich this
community was are explained in these verses. We can hardly imagine that cows, bulls and calves could be cared for
so nicely and decorated so well with cloths and valuable golden ornaments. How happy they were. As described
elsewhere in the Bhagavatam, during Maharaja Yudhisthira's time the cows were so happy that they used to muddy
the pasturing ground with milk. This is Indian civilization. Yet in the same place, India, Bharata-varsa, how much
people are suffering by giving up the Vedic way of life and not understanding the teachings of Bhagavad-gita.

When we consider the past condition of the agriculturalist in the village, we can see how opulent he was, simply
because of agricultural produce and protection of cows. At the present, however, agriculture having been neglected
and cow protection given up, the agriculturalist is suffering pitiably and is dressed in a niggardly torn cloth. This is
the distinction between the India of history and the India of the present day. By the atrocious activities of ugrakarma,
how we are killing the opportunity of human civilization!

natural beauty, the wives had full hips and full breasts, which moved as they hurried along.
The cowherd men and women in the villages lived a very natural life, and the women developed a natural
feminine beauty, with full hips and breasts. Because women in modern civilization do not live naturally, their hips
and breasts do not develop this natural fullness. Because of artificial living, women have lost their natural beauty,
although they claim to be independent and advanced in material civilization. This description of the village women
gives a clear example of the contrast between natural life and the artificial life of a condemned society, such as that
of the Western countries, where topless, bottomless beauty may be easily purchased in clubs and shops and for
public advertisements. The word balibhih indicates that the women were carrying gold coins, jeweled necklaces,
nice cloths, newly grown grass, sandalwood pulp, flower garlands and similar offerings on plates made of gold.
Such offerings are called bali. The words tvaritam jagmuh indicate how happy the village women were to
understand that mother Yasoda had given birth to a wonderful child known as Krsna.

garlands moving, were brilliantly beautiful.
The description of the gopis, who were going to the house of Maharaja Nanda to welcome Krsna, is especially
significant. The gopis were not ordinary women, but expansions of Krsna's pleasure potency, as described in the
Brahma-samhita (5.37,29):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis

Krsna is always worshiped by the gopis wherever He goes. Therefore Krsna is so vividly described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has also described Krsna in this way: ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhuvargena
ya kalpita. All these gopis were going to offer Krsna their presentations because the gopis are eternal
associates of the Lord. Now the gopis were more jubilant because of the news of Krsna's appearance in Vrndavana.

From this statement we can understand that five thousand years ago not only was there enough milk, butter and
curd to eat, drink and cook with, but when there was a festival it would be thrown about without restriction. There
was no limit to how extensively milk, butter, curd and other such products were used in human society. Everyone
had an ample stock of milk, and by using it in many varied milk preparations, people would keep good health in
natural ways and thus enjoy life in Krsna consciousness.

were they Narayana. Rather, they were devotees of Narayana, and by their educational qualifications they would
satisfy Narayana. Therefore, satisfying them was an indirect way of satisfying Lord Visnu. Mad-bhaktapujabhyadhika
(Bhag. 11.19.21). The Lord says, "Worshiping My devotees is better than worshiping Me directly."
The varnasrama system is entirely meant for visnu-aradhana, worship of Lord Visnu. Varnasramacaravata purusena
parah puman. visnur aradhyate (Visnu Purana 3.8.9). The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Visnu, the Supreme
Lord. The uncivilized man or materialistic person, however, does not know this aim of life. Na te viduh svarthagatim
hi visnum (Bhag. 7.5.31). One's real self-interest lies in satisfying Lord Visnu. Not satisfying Lord Visnu but
instead attempting to become happy through material adjustments (bahir-artha-maninah) is the wrong way for
happiness. Because Visnu is the root of everything, if Visnu is pleased, everyone is pleased; in particular, one's
children and family members become happy in all respects. Nanda Maharaja wanted to see his newborn child
happy. That was his purpose. Therefore he wanted to satisfy Lord Visnu, and to satisfy Lord Visnu it was necessary
to satisfy His devotees, such as the learned brahmanas, magadhas and sutas. Thus, in a roundabout way, ultimately
it was Lord Visnu who was to be satisfied.

The most fortunate Rohini, the mother of Baladeva, was honored by Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, and thus she
also dressed gorgeously and decorated herself with a necklace, a garland and other ornaments. She was busy
wandering here and there to receive the women who were guests at the festival.
Rohini, another wife of Vasudeva's, was also kept under the care of Nanda Maharaja with her son Baladeva.
Because her husband was imprisoned by Kamsa, she was not very happy, but on the occasion of Krsna-janmastami,
Nandotsava, when Nanda Maharaja gave dresses and ornaments to others, he also gave gorgeous garments and
ornaments to Rohini so that she could take part in the festival. Thus she also was busy receiving the women who
were guests. Because of her good fortune in being able to raise Krsna and Balarama together, she is described as
maha-bhaga, greatly fortunate.

O Maharaja Pariksit, the home of Nanda Maharaja is eternally the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead

beginning from Lord Krsna's appearance there, it became the place for the pastimes of the goddess of fortune.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.29), laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam govindam adi-purusam
tam aham bhajami. The abode of Krsna is always served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune.
Wherever Krsna goes, the goddess of fortune naturally resides with Him. The chief of the goddesses of fortune is
Srimati Radharani. Therefore, Krsna's appearance in the land of Vraja indicated that the chief goddess of fortune,
Radharani, would also appear there very soon. Nanda Maharaja's abode was already opulent, and since Krsna had
appeared, it would be opulent in all respects.

Because the killing of babies was going on and had already become known, Nanda Maharaja was very much
afraid for his newborn child. Thus he appointed the local cowherd men to protect his home and child. He wanted
to go immediately to Mathura to pay the taxes due and also to offer some presentation for the sake of his newborn
son. For the protection of the child, he had worshiped various demigods and forefathers and given charity to
everyone's satisfaction. Similarly, Nanda Maharaja wanted not only to pay Kamsa the yearly taxes but also to offer
some presentation so that Kamsa too would be satisfied. His only concern was how to protect his transcendental
child, Krsna.

When Vasudeva heard that Nanda Maharaja, his very dear friend and brother, had come to Mathura and already
paid the taxes to Kamsa, he went to Nanda Maharaja's residence.
Vasudeva and Nanda Maharaja were so intimately connected that they lived like brothers. Furthermore, it is
learned from the notes of Sripada Madhvacarya that Vasudeva and Nanda Maharaja were stepbrothers. Vasudeva's
father, Surasena, married a vaisya girl, and from her Nanda Maharaja was born. Later, Nanda Maharaja himself
married a vaisya girl, Yasoda. Therefore his family is celebrated as a vaisya family, and Krsna, identifying Himself as
their son, took charge of vaisya activities (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam). Balarama represents plowing the land for
agriculture and therefore always carries in His hand a plow, whereas Krsna tends cows and therefore carries a flute
in His hand. Thus the two brothers represent krsi-raksya and go-raksya.

My dear brother Nanda Maharaja, at an advanced age you had no son at all and were hopeless of having one.
Therefore, that you now have a son is a sign of great fortune.
At an advanced age one generally cannot beget a male child. If by chance one does beget a child at this age, the
child is generally female. Thus Vasudeva indirectly asked Nanda Maharaja whether he had actually begotten a male
child or a female child. Vasudeva knew that Yasoda had given birth to a female child, whom he had stolen and
replaced with a male child. This was a great mystery, and Vasudeva wanted to determine whether this mystery was
already known to Nanda Maharaja. On inquiring, however, he was confident that the mystery of Krsna's birth and
His being placed in the care of Yasoda was still hidden. There was no danger, since Kamsa at least could not learn
what had already happened.

My dear friend Nanda Maharaja, in the place where you are living with your friends, is the forest favorable for the

plants.
For human happiness, one must care for the animals, especially the cows. Vasudeva therefore inquired whether
there was a good arrangement for the animals where Nanda Maharaja lived. For the proper pursuit of human
happiness, there must be arrangements for the protection of cows. This means that there must be forests and
adequate pasturing grounds full of grass and water. If the animals are happy, there will be an ample supply of milk,
from which human beings will benefit by deriving many milk products with which to live happily. As enjoined in
Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma-svabhavajam. Without giving proper facilities to the
animals, how can human society be happy? That people are raising cattle to send to the slaughterhouse is a great
sin. By this demoniac enterprise, people are ruining their chance for a truly human life. Because they are not giving
any importance to the instructions of Krsna, the advancement of their so-called civilization resembles the crazy
efforts of men in a lunatic asylum.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Tenth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Meeting of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva."
Chapter Six
The Killing of the Demon Putana
A summary of the Sixth Chapter is as follows: when Nanda Maharaja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was
returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death.
While Nanda Maharaja, the King of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva's words concerning disturbances in
Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Sri Hari. Meanwhile, Kamsa sent to the village
of Gokula a Raksasi named Putana, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever
there is no Krsna consciousness, there is the danger of such Raksasis, but since the Supreme Personality of
Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Putana could accept nothing there but her own death.
One day, Putana arrived from outer space in Gokula, the home of Nanda Maharaja, and by displaying her mystic
power, she assumed the disguise of a very beautiful woman. Taking courage, she immediately entered Krsna's
bedroom without anyone's permission; by the grace of Krsna, no one forbade her to enter the house or the room,
because that was Krsna's desire. The baby Krsna, who resembled a fire covered by ashes, looked upon Putana and
thought that He would have to kill this demon, the beautiful woman. Enchanted by the influence of yogamaya and
the Personality of Godhead, Putana took Krsna upon her lap, and neither Rohini nor Yasoda objected. The demon
Putana offered her breast for Krsna to suck, but her breast was smeared with poison. The child Krsna, therefore,
squeezed Putana's breast so severely that in unbearable pain she had to assume her original body and fell to the
ground. Then Krsna began playing on her breast just like a small child. When Krsna was playing, the gopis were
pacified and took the child away to their own laps. After this incident, the gopis took precautions because of the
attack of the Raksasi. Mother Yasoda gave the child her breast to suck and then laid Him in bed.
Meanwhile, Nanda and his associates the cowherd men returned from Mathura, and when they saw the great
dead body of Putana, they were struck with wonder. Everyone was astonished that Vasudeva had foretold this
mishap, and they praised Vasudeva for his power of foresight. The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of
Putana into pieces, but because Krsna had sucked her breast, she had been freed from all sins, and therefore when
the cowherd men burned the pieces of her body in a fire, the smoke filled the air with a very pleasing fragrance.
Ultimately, although Putana had desired to kill Krsna, she attained the Lord's abode. From this incident we gain
the instruction that if one is attached to Krsna somehow or other, even as an enemy, one ultimately attains success.
What then is to be said of devotees who are naturally attached to Krsna in love? When the inhabitants of Vraja
heard about the killing of Putana and the welfare of the child, they were very much satisfied. Nanda Maharaja took
the baby Krsna on his lap and was filled with satisfaction.

Gokula. As Nanda Maharaja thought about the danger for his beautiful son, Krsna, he was afraid, and he took
shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme controller.
Whenever there is danger, the pure devotee thinks of the protection and shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is also advised in Bhagavad-gita (9.33): anityam asukham lokam imam prapya bhajasva mam. In
this material world there is danger at every step (padam padam yad vipadam). Therefore a devotee has no other
course than to take shelter of the Lord at every step.

Thakura has sung: namasraya kari' yatane tumi, thakaha apana kaje. Everyone is thus advised to seek shelter in the
chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and remain engaged in his own occupational duty. There is no loss in
this, and the gain is tremendous. Even from a material point of view, everyone should take to chanting the Hare
Krsna mantra to be saved from all kinds of danger. This world is full of danger (padam padam yad vipadam).
Therefore we should be encouraged to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra so that in our family, society,
neighborhood and nation, everything will be smooth and free from danger.

Once upon a time, Putana Raksasi, who could move according to her desire and was wandering in outer space,
converted herself by mystic power into a very beautiful woman and thus entered Gokula, the abode of Nanda
Maharaja.
Raksasis learn mystic powers by which they can travel in outer space without machines. In some parts of India
there are still such mystical witches, who can sit on a stick and use it to fly from one place to another in a very
short time. This art was known to Putana. Assuming the feature of a very beautiful woman, she entered Nanda
Maharaja's abode, Gokula.

Her hips were full, her breasts were large and firm, seeming to overburden her slim waist, and she was dressed
very nicely. Her hair, adorned with a garland of mallika flowers, was scattered about her beautiful face. Her
earrings were brilliant, and as she smiled very attractively, glancing upon everyone, her beauty drew the attention
of all the inhabitants of Vraja, especially the men. When the gopis saw her, they thought that the beautiful goddess
of fortune, holding a lotus flower in her hand, had come to see her husband, Krsna.

While searching for small children, Putana, whose business was to kill them, entered the house of Nanda
Maharaja unobstructed, having been sent by the superior potency of the Lord. Without asking anyone's permission,
she entered Nanda Maharaja's room, where she saw the child sleeping in bed, His unlimited power covered like a
powerful fire covered by ashes. She could understand that this child was not ordinary, but was meant to kill all
demons.
Demons are always busy creating disturbances and killing. But the child lying on the bed in the house of Nanda
Maharaja was meant to kill many demons.

Lord Sri Krsna, the all-pervading Supersoul, lying on the bed, understood that Putana, a witch who was expert in
killing small children, had come to kill Him. Therefore, as if afraid of her, Krsna closed His eyes. Thus Putana took
upon her lap Him who was to be her own annihilation, just as an unintelligent person places a sleeping snake on
his lap, thinking the snake to be a rope.
In this verse there are two perplexities. When Krsna saw that Putana had come to kill Him, He thought that since
this woman was present with motherly affection, although artificial, He had to offer her a benediction. Therefore
He looked at her with a little perplexity and then closed His eyes again. Putana Raksasi also was perplexed. She was
not intelligent enough to understand that she was taking a sleeping snake on her lap; she thought the snake to be
an ordinary rope. The two words antakam and anantam are contradictory. Because of not being intelligent, Putana
thought that she could kill her antakam, the source of her annihilation; but because He is ananta, unlimited, no
one can kill Him.

Putana Raksasi's heart was fierce and cruel, but she looked like a very affectionate mother. Thus she resembled a
sharp sword in a soft sheath. Although seeing her within the room, Yasoda and Rohini, overwhelmed by her
beauty, did not stop her, but remained silent because she treated the child like a mother.
Although Putana was an outsider and although she personified fierce death because the determination within her
heart was to kill the child, when she directly came and placed the child on her lap to offer the child her breast to
suck, the mothers were so captivated by her beauty that they did not prohibit her. Sometimes a beautiful woman is
dangerous because everyone, being captivated by external beauty (maya-mohita), is unable to understand what is
in her mind. Those who are captivated by the beauty of the external energy are called maya-mohita. Mohitam
nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam (Bg. 7.13). Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum durasaya ye bahir-arthamaninah
(Bhag. 7.5.31). Here, of course, the two mothers Rohini and Yasoda were not maya-mohita, deluded by
the external energy, but to develop the pastimes of the Lord, they were captivated by yogamaya. Such maya-moha
is the action of yogamaya.

The nipple of her breast was smeared with a dangerous, immediately effective poison, but the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Krsna, becoming very angry at her, took hold of her breast, squeezed it very hard with both hands,
and sucked out both the poison and her life.
Lord Krsna was not angry at Putana for His own sake. Rather, He was angry because the Raksasi had killed so
many small children in Vrajabhumi. Therefore He decided that she should be punished by having to forfeit her life.

Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead--Krsna. Although the Raksasi Putana could increase or decrease her
bodily size by her mystic abilities and thus gain proportionate power, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
equally powerful in any transcendental form. Krsna is the real Personality of Godhead because whether as a child
or as a grown-up young man, He is the same person. He does not need to become powerful by meditation or any
other external endeavor. Therefore when the greatly powerful Putana expanded her body, Krsna remained the same
small child and fearlessly played on the upper portion of her breast. Sadaisvarya-purna. Bhagavan, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, is always full in all potencies, regardless of whether He is present in this form or that. His
potencies are always full. Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate. He can display all potencies under any circumstances.

Thereafter, mother Yasoda and Rohini, along with the other elderly gopis, waved about the switch of a cow to

When Krsna was saved from such a great danger, mother Yasoda and Rohini were principally concerned, and the
other elderly gopis, who were almost equally concerned, followed the activities of mother Yasoda and Rohini. Here
we find that in household affairs, ladies could take charge of protecting a child simply by taking help from the cow.
As described here, they knew how to wave about the switch of a cow so as to protect the child from all types of
danger. There are so many facilities afforded by cow protection, but people have forgotten these arts. The
importance of protecting cows is therefore stressed by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisyakarma
svabhavajam). Even now in the Indian villages surrounding Vrndavana, the villagers live happily simply by
giving protection to the cow. They keep cow dung very carefully and dry it to use as fuel. They keep a sufficient
stock of grains, and because of giving protection to the cows, they have sufficient milk and milk products to solve
all economic problems. Simply by giving protection to the cow, the villagers live so peacefully. Even the urine and
stool of cows have medicinal value.

Nyasa-mantra includes acamana, or first drinking a sip of water kept in the right hand. There are different visnumantras
to purify the body. The gopis, and in fact any householders, knew the process for being purified by
chanting Vedic hymns. The gopis executed this process first to purify themselves and then to purify the child
Krsna. One executes the process of anga-nyasa and kara-nyasa simply by drinking a little sip of water and chanting
the mantra. The mantra is preceded with the first letter of the name, followed by anusvara and the word namah:
om namo 'jas tavanghri avyat, mam mano manimams tava januni avyat, and so on. By losing Indian culture, Indian
householders have forgotten how to execute the anga-nyasa and are simply busy in sense gratification, without any
advanced knowledge of human civilization.

The evil witches known as Dakinis, Yatudhanis and Kusmandas are the greatest enemies of children, and the evil
spirits like Bhutas, Pretas, Pisacas, Yaksas, Raksasas and Vinayakas, as well as witches like Kotara, Revati, Jyestha,
Putana and Matrka, are always ready to give trouble to the body, the life air and the senses, causing loss of memory,
madness and bad dreams. Like the most experienced evil stars, they all create great disturbances, especially for
children, but one can vanquish them simply by uttering Lord Visnu's name, for when Lord Visnu's name resounds,
all of them become afraid and go away.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33):
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person--nondual, infallible, and
without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and although He is the
oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot
be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees."
While decorating the body with tilaka, we give protection to the body by chanting twelve names of Visnu.
Although Govinda, or Lord Visnu, is one, He has different names and forms with which to act differently. But if
one cannot remember all the names at one time, one may simply chant, "Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu, Lord Visnu," and
always think of Lord Visnu. Visnor aradhanam param: this is the highest form of worship. If one remembers Visnu
always, even though one is disturbed by many bad elements, one can be protected without a doubt. The Ayurvedasastra
recommends, ausadhi cintayet visnum: even while taking medicine, one should remember Visnu, because
the medicine is not all and all and Lord Visnu is the real protector. The material world is full of danger (padam
padam yad vipadam). Therefore one must become a Vaisnava and think of Visnu constantly. This is made easier by
the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended, kirtaniyah
sada harih, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam, and kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet.

maternal affection; gopibhih--by the elderly gopis, headed by mother Yasoda; krta-raksanam--all measures were

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: All the gopis, headed by mother Yasoda, were bound by maternal affection.
After they thus chanted mantras to protect the child, mother Yasoda gave the child the nipple of her breast to suck
and then got Him to lie down on His bed.
When a baby drinks milk from the breast of his mother, this is a good sign of health. So the elderly gopis were
not satisfied with chanting mantras to give protection to Krsna; they also tested whether their child's health was in
order. When the child sucked the breast, this confirmed that He was healthy, and when the gopis were fully
satisfied, they had the child lie down on His bed.

Meanwhile, all the cowherd men, headed by Nanda Maharaja, returned from Mathura, and when they saw on the
way the gigantic body of Putana lying dead, they were struck with great wonder.
Nanda Maharaja's wonder may be understood in various ways. First of all, the cowherd men had never before
seen such a gigantic body in Vrndavana, and therefore they were struck with wonder. Then they began to consider
where such a body had come from, whether it had dropped from the sky, or whether, by some mistake or by the
power of some mystic yogini, they had come to some place other than Vrndavana. They could not actually guess
what had happened, and therefore they were struck with wonder.

Nanda Maharaja and the other gopas exclaimed: My dear friends, you must know that Anakadundubhi,

calamity and predicted it to us?
This verse illustrates the difference between ksatriyas and innocent vaisyas. By studying the political situation,
Vasudeva could see what would happen, whereas Nanda Maharaja, the king of the agriculturalists, could only
guess that Vasudeva was a great saintly person and had developed mystic powers. Vasudeva actually had all mystic
powers under his control; otherwise he could not have become the father of Krsna. But in fact he foresaw the
calamities in Vraja by studying Kamsa's political activities and thus warned Nanda Maharaja to take precautions,
although Nanda Maharaja thought that Vasudeva had predicted this incident through wonderful mystic powers. By
mystic powers gained through the practice of hatha-yoga, one can study and understand the future.

The inhabitants of Vraja cut the gigantic body of Putana into pieces with the help of axes. Then they threw the

It is the practice that after a snake has been killed, its body is cut into various pieces for fear that it may come to
life again simply by interacting with air. Merely killing a serpent is not sufficient; after it is killed, it must be cut to
pieces and burned, and then the danger will be over. Putana resembled a great serpent, and therefore the cowherd
men took the same precautions by burning her body to ashes.

because of Krsna's having sucked her breast; sapadi--immediately; ahata-papmanah--her material body
became spiritualized or relieved of all material conditions.
Because of Krsna's having sucked the breast of the Raksasi Putana, when Krsna killed her she was immediately
freed of all material contamination. Her sinful reactions automatically vanished, and therefore when her gigantic
body was being burnt, the smoke emanating from her body was fragrant like aguru incense.
Such are the effects of Krsna consciousness. If one somehow or other becomes Krsna conscious by applying his
senses in the service of the Lord, one is immediately freed from material contamination. Srnvatam sva-kathah
krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah (Bhag. 1.2.17). Hearing about the activities of Krsna is the beginning of purified
life. Punya-sravana-kirtanah: simply by hearing and chanting, one becomes purified. Therefore, in discharging
devotional service, sravana-kirtana (hearing and chanting) is most important. Then, with purified senses, one
begins to render service to the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam). Bhaktir ucyate: this is called bhakti. When
Putana was somehow or other, directly or indirectly, induced to render some service to the Lord by feeding Him
with her breast, she was immediately purified, so much so that when her nasty material body was burnt to ashes, it
gave off the fragrance of aguru, the most agreeably scented herb.

Putana was always hankering for the blood of human children, and with that desire she came to kill Krsna; but
because she offered her breast to the Lord, she attained the greatest achievement. What then is to be said of those
who had natural devotion and affection for Krsna as mothers and who offered Him their breasts to suck or offered
something very dear, as a mother offers something to a child?
Putana had no affection for Krsna; rather, she was envious and wanted to kill Him. Nonetheless, because with or
without knowledge she offered her breast, she attained the highest achievement in life. But the offerings of devotees
attracted to Krsna in parental love are always sincere. A mother likes to offer something to her child with affection
and love; there is no question of envy. So here we can make a comparative study. If Putana could attain such an
exalted position in spiritual life by neglectfully, enviously making an offering to Krsna, what is to be said of mother
Yasoda and the other gopis, who served Krsna with such great affection and love, offering everything for Krsna's
satisfaction? The gopis automatically achieved the highest perfection. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
recommended the affection of the gopis, either in maternal affection or in conjugal love, as the highest perfection
in life (ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhu-vargena ya kalpita).

mothers (who allowed their nipples to be sucked by Krsna).
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is always situated within the core of the heart of the pure devotee,
and He is always offered prayers by such worshipable personalities as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Because Krsna
embraced Putana's body with great pleasure and sucked her breast, although she was a great witch, she attained the
position of a mother in the transcendental world and thus achieved the highest perfection. What then is to be said
of the cows whose nipples Krsna sucked with great pleasure and who offered their milk very jubilantly with
affection exactly like that of a mother?
These verses explain how devotional service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whether directly
or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly, becomes successful. Putana was neither a devotee nor a nondevotee; she
was actually a demoniac witch instructed by Kamsa to kill Krsna. Nonetheless, in the beginning she assumed the
form of a very beautiful woman and approached Krsna exactly like an affectionate mother, so that mother Yasoda
and Rohini did not doubt her sincerity. The Lord took all this into consideration, and thus she was automatically
promoted to a position like that of mother Yasoda. As explained by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, there are
various roles one may play in such a position. Putana was immediately promoted to Vaikunthaloka, which is also
sometimes described as Svarga. The Svarga mentioned in this verse is not the material heavenly planet, but the
transcendental world. In Vaikunthaloka, Putana attained the position of a nurse (dhatry-ucitam), as described by
Uddhava. Putana was elevated to the position of a nurse and maidservant in Goloka Vrndavana to assist mother
Yasoda.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the bestower of many benedictions, including liberation
[kaivalya], or oneness with the Brahman effulgence. For that Personality of Godhead, the gopis always felt maternal
love, and Krsna sucked their breasts with full satisfaction. Therefore, because of their relationship as mother and
son, although the gopis were engaged in various family activities, one should never think that they returned to this
material world after leaving their bodies.
The advantage of Krsna consciousness is described herein. Krsna consciousness gradually develops on the
transcendental platform. One may think of Krsna as the supreme personality, one may think of Krsna as the
supreme master, one may think of Krsna as the supreme friend, one may think of Krsna as the supreme son, or one
may think of Krsna as the supreme conjugal lover. If one is connected with Krsna in any of these transcendental
relationships, the course of one's material life is understood to have already ended. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(4.9), tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: for such devotees, going back home, back to Godhead, is
guaranteed. Na punah kalpate rajan samsaro jnana-sambhavah. This verse also guarantees that devotees who
constantly think of Krsna in a particular relationship will never return to this material world. In this material world
of samsara, there are the same relationships. One thinks, "Here is my son," "Here is my wife," "Here is my lover,"
or "Here is my friend." But these relationships are temporary illusions. Ajnana-sambhavah: such a consciousness
awakens in ignorance. But when the same relationships awaken in Krsna consciousness, one's spiritual life is
revived, and one is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead. Even though the gopis who were friends of
Rohini and mother Yasoda and who allowed their breasts to be sucked by Krsna were not directly Krsna's mothers,
they all had the same chance as Rohini and Yasoda to go back to Godhead and act as Krsna's mothers-in-law,
servants and so on. The word samsara refers to attachment for one's body, home, husband or wife, and children,
but although the gopis and all the other inhabitants of Vrndavana had the same affection and attachment for
husband and home, their central affection was for Krsna in some transcendental relationship, and therefore they
were guaranteed to be promoted to Goloka Vrndavana in the next life, to live with Krsna eternally in spiritual
happiness. The easiest way to attain spiritual elevation, to be liberated from this material world, and to go back
home, back to Godhead, is recommended by Bhaktivinoda Thakura: krsnera samsara kara chadi' anacara. One
should give up all sinful activities and remain in the family of Krsna. Then one's liberation is guaranteed.

Any person who hears with faith and devotion about how Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed
Putana, and who thus invests his hearing in such childhood pastimes of Krsna, certainly attains attachment for
Govinda, the supreme, original person.
The incident in which the great witch attempted to kill the child but was killed herself is certainly wonderful.
Therefore this verse uses the word adbhutam, meaning "specifically wonderful." Krsna has left us many wonderful
narrations about Him. Simply by reading these narrations, as they are described in Krsna, the Supreme personality
of Godhead, one gains salvation from this material world and gradually develops attachment to and devotion for
Govinda, Adi-purusa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled "The
Killing of the Demon Putana."
Chapter Seven
The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta
In this chapter, Sri Krsna's pastimes of breaking the cart (sakata-bhanjana), killing the asura known as Trnavarta,
and demonstrating the entire universe within His mouth are especially described.
When Sukadeva Gosvami saw that Maharaja Pariksit was eagerly waiting to hear about Lord Krsna's pastimes as a
child, he was very much pleased, and he continued to speak. When Sri Krsna was only three months old and was
just trying to turn backside up, before He even attempted to crawl, mother Yasoda wanted to observe a ritualistic
ceremony with her friends for the good fortune of the child. Such a ritualistic ceremony is generally performed
with ladies who also have small children. When mother Yasoda saw that Krsna was falling asleep, because of other
engagements she put the child underneath a household cart, called sakata, and while the child was sleeping, she
engaged herself in other business pertaining to the auspicious ritualistic ceremony. Underneath the cart was a
cradle, and mother Yasoda placed the child in that cradle. The child was sleeping, but suddenly He awakened and,
as usual for a child, began to kick His small legs. This kicking shook the cart, which collapsed with a great sound,
breaking completely and spilling all its contents. Children who were playing nearby immediately informed mother
Yasoda that the cart had broken, and therefore she hastily arrived there in great anxiety with the other gopis.
Mother Yasoda immediately took the child on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast. Then various types of
Vedic ritualistic ceremonies were performed with the help of the brahmanas. Not knowing the real identity of the
child, the brahmanas showered the child with blessings.
Another day, when mother Yasoda was sitting with her child on her lap, she suddenly observed that he had
assumed the weight of the entire universe. She was so astonished that she had to put the child down, and in the
meantime Trnavarta, one of the servants of Kamsa, appeared there as a whirlwind and took the child away. The
whole tract of land known as Gokula became surcharged with dust, no one could see where the child had been
taken, and all the gopis were overwhelmed because He had been taken away in the dust storm. But up in the sky,
the asura, being overburdened by the child, could not carry the child far away, although he also could not drop the
child because the child had caught him so tightly that it was difficult for him to separate the child from his body.
Thus Trnavarta himself fell down from a very great height, the child grasping him tightly by the shoulder, and
immediately died. The demon having fallen, the gopis picked the child up and delivered Him to the lap of mother
Yasoda. Thus mother Yasoda was struck with wonder, but because of yogamaya's influence, no one could
understand who Krsna was and what had actually happened. Rather, everyone began to praise fortune for the
child's having been saved from such a calamity. Nanda Maharaja, of course, was thinking of the wonderful
foretelling of Vasudeva and began to praise him as a great yogi. Later, when the child was on the lap of mother
Yasoda, the child yawned, and mother Yasoda could see within His mouth the entire universal manifestation.

King Pariksit said: My lord, Sukadeva Gosvami, all the various activities exhibited by the incarnations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead are certainly pleasing to the ear and to the mind. Simply by one's hearing of these
activities, the dirty things in one's mind immediately vanish. Generally we are reluctant to hear about the activities
of the Lord, but Krsna's childhood activities are so attractive that they are automatically pleasing to the mind and
ear. Thus one's attachment for hearing about material things, which is the root cause of material existence,
vanishes, and one gradually develops devotional service to the Supreme Lord, attachment for Him, and friendship
with devotees who give us the contribution of Krsna consciousness. If you think it fit, kindly speak about those
activities of the Lord.
As stated in the prema-vivarta:
krsna-bahirmukha haiya bhoga-vancha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
Our material existence is maya, or illusion, in which we desire different varieties of material enjoyment and
therefore change to different varieties of bodies (bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya). Asann api
klesada asa dehah: as long as we have these temporary bodies, they give us many varieties of tribulation--
adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika. This is the root cause of all suffering, but this root cause of suffering
can be removed by revival of our Krsna consciousness. All the Vedic literatures presented by Vyasadeva and other
great sages are therefore intended to revive our Krsna consciousness, which begins to revive with sravana-kirtanam.
Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah (Bhag. 1.2.17). Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic literatures exist simply to give us
a chance to hear about Krsna. Krsna has different avataras, or incarnations, all of which are wonderful and which
arouse one's inquisitiveness, but generally such avataras as Matsya, Kurma and Varaha are not as attractive as
Krsna. First of all, however, we have no attraction for hearing about Krsna, and this is the root cause of our
suffering.
But Pariksit Maharaja specifically mentions that the wonderful activities of baby Krsna, which amazed mother
Yasoda and the other inhabitants of Vraja, are especially attractive. From the very beginning of His childhood,
Krsna killed Putana, Trnavarta and Sakatasura and showed the entire universe within His mouth. Thus the
pastimes of Krsna, one after another, kept mother Yasoda and all the inhabitants of Vraja in great astonishment.
The process to revive one's Krsna consciousness is adau sraddha tatah sadhu-sangah (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
1.4.15). The pastimes of Krsna can be properly received from devotees. If one has developed a little bit of Krsna
consciousness by hearing from Vaisnavas about the activities of Krsna, one becomes attached to Vaisnavas who are
interested only in Krsna consciousness. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja recommends that one hear about Krsna's
childhood activities, which are more attractive than the activities of other incarnations, such as Matsya, Kurma and
Varaha. Wanting to hear more and more from Sukadeva Gosvami, Maharaja Pariksit requested him to continue
describing Krsna's childhood activities, which are especially easy to hear and which create more and more
inquisitiveness.

Please describe other pastimes of Krsna, the Supreme Personality, who appeared on this planet earth, imitating a
human child and performing wonderful activities like killing Putana.
Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva Gosvami to narrate other childhood pastimes exhibited by Krsna while
playing as a human child. The Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnates at different times in different planets
and universes, and according to the nature of those places, He exhibits His unlimited potency. That a child sitting
on the lap of his mother was able to kill the gigantic Putana is extremely wonderful for the inhabitants of this
planet, but on other planets the inhabitants are more advanced, and therefore the pastimes the Lord performs there
are still more wonderful. Krsna's appearance on this planet like a human being makes us more fortunate than the
demigods in the higher planets, and therefore Maharaja Pariksit was very much interested in hearing about Him.

sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak (at the request of Maharaja Pariksit); kadacit--at that
time (when Krsna was three months old); autthanika-kautuka-aplave--when Krsna was three or four months old
and His body was developing, He attempted to turn around, and this pleasing occasion was observed with a festival
and bathing ceremony; janma-rksa-yoge--at that time, there was also a conjunction of the moon with the
auspicious constellation Rohini; samaveta-yositam--(the ceremony was observed) among the assembled women, a

of Vedic hymns by qualified brahmanas; cakara--executed; sunoh--of her son; abhisecanam--the bathing ceremony;
sati--mother Yasoda.
Sukadeva Gosvami said: When mother Yasoda's baby was slanting His body to attempt to rise and turn around,
this attempt was observed by a Vedic ceremony. In such a ceremony, called utthana, which is performed when a
child is due to leave the house for the first time, the child is properly bathed. Just after Krsna turned three months
old, mother Yasoda celebrated this ceremony with other women of the neighborhood. On that day, there was a
conjunction of the moon with the constellation Rohini. As the brahmanas joined by chanting Vedic hymns and
professional musicians also took part, this great ceremony was observed by mother Yasoda
There is no question of overpopulation or of children's being a burden for their parents in a Vedic society. Such a
society is so well organized and people are so advanced in spiritual consciousness that childbirth is never regarded
as a burden or a botheration. The more a child grows, the more his parents become jubilant, and the child's
attempts to turn over are also a source of jubilation. Even before the child is born, when the mother is pregnant,
many recommended ritualistic ceremonies are performed. For example, when the child has been within the womb
for three months and for seven months, there is a ceremony the mother observes by eating with neighboring
children. This ceremony is called svada-bhaksana. Similarly, before the birth of the child there is the garbhadhana
ceremony. In Vedic civilization, childbirth or pregnancy is never regarded as a burden; rather, it is a cause for
jubilation. In contrast, people in modern civilization do not like pregnancy or childbirth, and when there is a child,
they sometimes kill it. We can just consider how human society has fallen since the inauguration of Kali-yuga.
Although people still claim to be civilized, at the present moment there is actually no human civilization, but only
an assembly of two-legged animals.

The brahmanas properly chanted Vedic hymns to observe the auspicious ceremony, and when they finished and
mother Yasoda saw that the child felt sleepy, she lay down on the bed with the child until He was peacefully asleep.
An affectionate mother takes great care of her child and is always anxious to see that the child is not disturbed
even for a moment. As long as the child wants to remain with the mother, the mother stays with the child, and the
child feels very comfortable. Mother Yasoda saw that her child felt sleepy, and to give Him all facilities for sleep,
she lay down with the child, and when He was peaceful, she got up to attend to her other household affairs.

the assembled guests; pujayati--just to satisfy them; vraja-okasah--to the inhabitants of Vraja; na--not; eva--

The liberal mother Yasoda, absorbed in celebrating the utthana ceremony, was busy receiving guests, worshiping
them with all respect and offering them clothing, cows, garlands and grains. Thus she could not hear the child
crying for His mother. At that time, the child Krsna, demanding to drink the milk of His mother's breast, angrily
threw His legs upward.
Krsna had been placed underneath a household handcart, but this handcart was actually another form of the
Sakatasura, a demon who had come there to kill the child. Now, on the plea of demanding to suck His mother's
breast, Krsna took this opportunity to kill the demon. Thus He kicked Sakatasura just to expose him. Although
Krsna's mother was engaged in receiving guests, Lord Krsna wanted to draw her attention by killing the Sakatasura,
and therefore he kicked that cart-shaped demon. Such are the pastimes of Krsna. Krsna wanted to draw the
attention of His mother, but while doing so He created a great havoc not understandable by ordinary persons.
These narrations are wonderfully enjoyable, and those who are fortunate are struck with wonder upon hearing of
these extraordinary activities of the Lord. Although the less intelligent regard them as mythological because a dull
brain cannot understand them, they are real facts. These narrations are actually so enjoyable and enlightening that
Maharaja Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami took pleasure in them, and other liberated persons, following in their
footsteps, become fully jubilant by hearing about the wonderful activities of the Lord.

Lord Sri Krsna was lying down underneath the handcart in one corner of the courtyard, and although His little
legs were as soft as leaves, when He struck the cart with His legs, it turned over violently and collapsed. The wheels
separated from the axle, the hubs and spokes fell apart, and the pole of the handcart broke. On the cart there were
many little utensils made of various metals, and all of them scattered hither and thither.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has commented on this verse as follows. When Lord Krsna was of a very
tender age, His hands and legs resembled soft new leaves, yet simply by touching the handcart with His legs, He
made the cart fall to pieces. It was quite possible for Him to act in this way and yet not exert Himself very much.
The Lord in His Vamana avatara had to extend His foot to the greatest height to penetrate the covering of the
universe, and when the Lord killed the gigantic demon Hiranyakasipu, He had to assume the special bodily feature
of Nrsimhadeva. But in His Krsna avatara, the Lord did not need to exert such energy. Therefore, krsnas tu
bhagavan svayam: Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. In other incarnations, the Lord had to
exert some energy according to the time and circumstances, but in this form He exhibited unlimited potency. Thus
the handcart collapsed, its joints broken, and all the metal pots and utensils scattered.
The Vaisnava-tosani remarks that although the handcart was higher than the child, the child could easily touch
the wheel of the cart, and this was sufficient to send the demon down to the earth. The Lord simultaneously
pushed the demon to the earth and superficially broke the handcart.

ksiptam etat--this cart was dashed apart and immediately fell dismantled; na samsayah--there is no doubt about it.
The assembled cowherd men and ladies began to contemplate how this thing had happened. "Is it the work of
some demon or evil planet?" they asked. At that time, the small children present asserted that the cart had been
kicked apart by the baby Krsna. As soon as the crying baby bad kicked the cart's wheel, the cart had collapsed.
There was no doubt about it.
We have heard of people's being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a
gross body to stay in and haunt. The Sakatasura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking
for the opportunity to do mischief to Krsna. When Krsna kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the
ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was
possible for Krsna because He has full potency, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.32):
angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti
pasyanti panti kalayanti ciram jaganti
ananda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Krsna's body is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, or ananda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha. That is, any of the parts of His anandacinmaya
body can act for any other part. Such are the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Supreme Lord does not need to acquire these potencies; He already has them. Thus Krsna kicked
His little legs, and His whole purpose was fulfilled. Also, when the handcart broke, an ordinary child could have
been injured in many ways, but because Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He enjoyed the dismantling
of the cart, and nothing injured Him. Everything done by Him is ananda-cinmaya-rasa, full transcendental bliss.
Thus Krsna factually enjoyed.
The nearby children saw that actually Krsna had kicked the wheel of the cart and this was how the accident
happened. By the arrangement of yogamaya, all the gopis and gopas thought that the accident had taken place
because of some bad planet or some ghost, but in fact everything was done by Krsna and enjoyed by Him. Those
who enjoy the activities of Krsna are also on the platform of ananda-cinmaya-rasa; they are liberated from the
material platform. When one develops the practice of hearing krsna-katha, he is certainly transcendental to
material existence, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). Unless one is
on the spiritual platform, one cannot enjoy the transcendental activities of Krsna; or in other words, whoever
engages in hearing the transcendental activities of Krsna is not on the material platform, but on the transcendental,
spiritual platform.

When brahmanas are free from envy, untruthfulness, unnecessary pride, grudges, disturbance by the opulence of
others, and false prestige, their blessings never go in vain. Considering this, Nanda Maharaja soberly took Krsna on
his lap and invited such truthful brahmanas to perform a ritualistic ceremony according to the holy hymns of the
Sama Veda, Rg Veda and Yajur Veda. Then, while the hymns were being chanted, he bathed the child with water
mixed with pure herbs, and after performing a fire ceremony, he sumptuously fed all the brahmanas with first-class
grains and other food.
Nanda Maharaja was very confident about the qualifications of the brahmanas and their blessings. He was fully
confident that simply if the good brahmanas showered their blessings, the child Krsna would be happy. The
blessings of qualified brahmanas can bring happiness not only to Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but
to everyone. Because Krsna is self-sufficient, He does not require anyone's blessings, yet Nanda Maharaja thought
that Krsna required the blessings of the brahmanas. What then is to be said of others? In human society, therefore,
there must be an ideal class of men, brahmanas, who can bestow blessings upon others, namely, upon the ksatriyas,
vaisyas and sudras, so that everyone will be happy. Krsna therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13) that human society
must have four social orders (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah); it is not that everyone should
become a sudra or a vaisya and human society will prosper. As enunciated in Bhagavad-gita, there must be a class
of brahmanas with qualities like satya (truthfulness), sama (peacefulness), dama (self-control) and titiksa
(tolerance).
Here also, in the Bhagavatam, Nanda Maharaja invites qualified brahmanas. There may be caste brahmanas, and
we have all respect for them, but their birth in brahmana families does not mean that they are qualified to bestow
blessings upon the other members of human society. This is the verdict of the sastras. In Kali-yuga, caste
brahmanas are accepted as brahmanas. Vipratve sutram eva hi (Bhag. 12.2.3): in Kali-yuga, simply by putting on a
thread worth two paise, one becomes a brahmana. Such brahmanas were not called for by Nanda Maharaja. As
stated by Narada Muni (Bhag. 7.11.35), yasya yal laksanam proktam. The symptoms of a brahmana are stated in
sastra, and one must be qualified with these symptoms.
The blessings of brahmanas who are not envious, disturbed or puffed up with pride and false prestige and who
are fully qualified with truthfulness will be useful. Therefore a class of men must be trained as brahmanas from the
very beginning. Brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto guror hitam (Bhag. 7.12.1). The word dantah is very important.
Dantah refers to one who is not envious, disturbing or puffed up with false prestige. With the Krsna consciousness
movement, we are trying to introduce such brahmanas in society. Brahmanas must ultimately be Vaisnavas, and if
one is a Vaisnava, he has already acquired the qualifications of a brahmana. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma (Bg.
18.54). The word brahma-bhuta refers to becoming a brahmana, or understanding what is Brahman (brahma
janatiti brahmanah). One who is brahma-bhuta is always happy (prasannatma). Na socati na kanksati: he is never
disturbed about material necessities. Samah sarvesu bhutesu: he is ready to bestow blessings upon everyone
equally. Mad-bhaktim labhate param: then he becomes a Vaisnava. In this age, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura introduced the sacred thread ceremony for his Vaisnava disciples, with the idea that people should
understand that when one becomes a Vaisnava he has already acquired the qualifications of a brahmana. Therefore
in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, those who are twice initiated so as to become brahmanas
must bear in mind their great responsibility to be truthful, control the mind and senses, be tolerant, and so on.
Then their life will be successful. It was such brahmanas that Nanda Maharaja invited to chant the Vedic hymns,
not ordinary brahmanas. Verse thirteen distinctly mentions himsa-mana. The word mana refers to false prestige or
false pride. Those who were falsely proud, thinking that they were brahmanas because they were born in brahmana
families, were never invited by Nanda Maharaja on such occasions.
Verse fourteen mentions pavitrausadhi. In any ritualistic ceremony, many herbs and leaves were required. These
were known as pavitra-patra. Sometimes there were nimba leaves, sometimes bael leaves, mango leaves, asvattha
leaves or amalaki leaves. Similarly, there were panca-gavya, panca-sasya and panca-ratna. Although Nanda
Maharaja belonged to the vaisya community, everything was known to him.
The most important word in these verses is maha-gunam, indicating that the brahmanas were offered very
palatable food of exalted quality. Such palatable dishes were generally prepared with two things, namely food
grains and milk products. Bhagavad-gita (18.44) therefore enjoins that human society must give protection to the
cows and encourage agriculture (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam). Simply by expert cooking,
hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes can be prepared from agricultural produce and milk products. This is
indicated here by the words annam maha-gunam. Still today in India, from these two things, namely food grains
and milk, hundreds and thousands of varieties of food are prepared, and then they are offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. (Catur-vidha-sri-bhagavat-prasada. patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya
prayacchati.) Then the prasada is distributed. Even today in Jagannatha-ksetra and other big temples, very palatable
dishes are offered to the Deity, and prasada is distributed profusely. Cooked by first-class brahmanas with expert
knowledge and then distributed to the public, this prasada is also a blessing from the brahmanas or Vaisnavas.
There are four kinds of prasada (catur-vidha). Salty, sweet, sour and pungent tastes are made with different types of
spices, and the food is prepared in four divisions, called carvya, cusya, lehya and pehya--prasada that is chewed,
prasada that is licked, prasada tasted with the tongue, and prasada that is drunk. Thus there are many varieties of
prasada, prepared very nicely with grains and ghee, offered to the Deity and distributed to the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas and then to the general public. This is the way of human society. Killing the cows and spoiling the land
will not solve the problem of food. This is not civilization. Uncivilized men living in the jungle and being
unqualified to produce food by agriculture and cow protection may eat animals, but a perfect human society
advanced in knowledge must learn how to produce first-class food simply by agriculture and protection of cows.

Brahmanas fully equipped with the brahminical qualifications are always yogis fully powerful in mystic yoga.
Their words never fail. In every transaction with other members of society, brahmanas are certainly dependable. In
this age, however, one must take into account that the brahmanas are uncertain in their qualifications. Because
there are no yajnic brahmanas, all yajnas are forbidden. The only yajna recommended in this age is sankirtanayajna.
Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32). Yajna is meant to satisfy Visnu (yajnarthat

perform yajna by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). Life is meant
for yajna, and yajna is performed by the chanting of Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama,

Lalayanti. Sometimes a mother lifts her child, and when the child falls in her hands, the child laughs, and the
mother also enjoys pleasure. Yasoda used to do this, but this time Krsna became very heavy, and she could not bear
His weight. Under the circumstances, it is to be understood that Krsna was aware of the coming of Trnavartasura,
who would take Him far away from His mother. Krsna knew that when Trnavarta came and took Him away from
His mother's lap, mother Yasoda would be greatly bereaved. He did not want His mother to suffer any difficulty
from the demon. Therefore, because He is the source of everything (janmady asya yatah), He assumed the
heaviness of the entire universe. The child was on the lap of Yasoda, who was therefore in possession of everything
in the world, but when the child assumed such heaviness, she had to put Him down in order to give Trnavartasura
an opportunity to take Him away and play with Him for some time before the child returned to the lap of His
mother.

Feeling the child to be as heavy as the entire universe and therefore being anxious, thinking that perhaps the
child was being attacked by some other ghost or demon, the astonished mother Yasoda put the child down on the
ground and began to think of Narayana. Foreseeing disturbances, she called for the brahmanas to counteract this
heaviness, and then she engaged in her other household affairs. She had no alternative than to remember the lotus
feet of Narayana, for she could not understand that Krsna was the original source of everything.
Mother Yasoda did not understand that Krsna is the heaviest of all heavy things and that Krsna rests within
everything (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani). As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), maya tatam idam sarvam jagad
avyakta-murtina: Krsna is everywhere in His impersonal form, and everything rests upon Him. Nonetheless, na
caham tesv avasthitah: Krsna is not everywhere. Mother Yasoda was unable to understand this philosophy because
she was dealing with Krsna as His real mother by the arrangement of yogamaya. Not understanding the importance
of Krsna, she could only seek shelter of Narayana for Krsna's safety and call the brahmanas to counteract the
situation.

Personality of Godhead; nabhah-gatah--went up to the top of the sky; gantum--to go further; na asaknot--was not
able; bhuri-bhara-bhrt--because Krsna then became more powerful and heavy than the demon.
Having assumed the form of a forceful whirlwind, the demon Trnavarta took Krsna very high in the sky, but
when Krsna became heavier than the demon, the demon had to stop his force and could go no further.
Here is a competition in yogic power between Krsna and Trnavartasura. By practicing mystic yoga, asuras
generally attain some perfection in the eight siddhis, or perfections, namely anima, laghima, mahima, prapti,
prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita. But although a demon may acquire such powers to a very limited
extent, he cannot compete with the mystic power of Krsna, for Krsna is Yogesvara, the source of all mystic power
(yatra yogesvaro harih). No one can compete with Krsna. Sometimes, of course, having acquired a fragmental
portion of Krsna's mystic power, asuras demonstrate their power to the foolish public and assert themselves to be
God, not knowing that God is the supreme Yogesvara. Here also we see that Trnavarta assumed the mahima-siddhi
and took Krsna away as if Krsna were an ordinary child. But Krsna also became a mystic mahima-siddha. When
mother Yasoda was carrying Him, He became so heavy that His mother, who was usually accustomed to carrying
Him, could not bear Him and had to place Him down on the ground. Thus Trnavarta had been able to take Krsna
away in the presence of mother Yasoda. But when Krsna, high in the sky, assumed the mahima-siddhi, the demon,
unable to go further, was obliged to stop his force and come down according to Krsna's desire. One should not,
therefore, compete with Krsna's mystic power.
Devotees automatically have all mystic power, but they do not like to compete with Krsna. Instead, they fully
surrender to Krsna, and their yogic power is demonstrated by Krsna's mercy. Devotees can show mystic yoga so
powerful that a demon could not even dream of it, but they never try to demonstrate it for their personal sense
gratification. Whatever they do is for the service of the Lord, and therefore they are always in a position superior to
that of the demons. There are many karmis, yogis and jnanis who artificially try to compete with Krsna, and thus
ordinary, foolish people who do not care to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam from authorities consider some rascal yogi to
be Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment there are many so-called babas who
present themselves as incarnations of God by showing some insignificant mystic wonder, and foolish people regard
them as God because of lacking knowledge of Krsna.

Because of Krsna's weight, Trnavarta considered Him to be like a great mountain or a hunk of iron. But because
Krsna had caught the demon's neck, the demon was unable to throw Him off. He therefore thought of the child as
wonderful, since he could neither bear the child nor cast aside the burden.
Trnavarta intended to take Krsna up in the sky and kill Him, but Krsna enjoyed the pastime of riding on
Trnavarta's body and traveling for a while in the sky. Thus Trnavarta's attempt to kill Krsna failed, while Krsna,
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha, enjoyed this pastime. Now, since Trnavarta was falling because of Krsna's heaviness,
he wanted to save himself by throwing Krsna off from his neck, but was unable to do so because Krsna held him
very tightly. Consequently, this would be the last time for Trnavarta's yogic power. Now he was going to die by the
arrangement of Krsna.

It is most astonishing that although this innocent child was taken away by the Raksasa to be eaten, He has
returned without having been killed or even injured. Because this demon was envious, cruel and sinful, he has
been killed for his own sinful activities. This is the law of nature. An innocent devotee is always protected by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a sinful person is always vanquished for his sinful life.
Krsna conscious life means innocent devotional life, and a sadhu is one who is fully devoted to Krsna. As
confirmed by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (9.30), bhajate mam ananya-bhak sadhur eva sa mantavyah: anyone fully
attached to Krsna is a sadhu. Nanda Maharaja and the gopis and other cowherd men could not understand that
Krsna was the Supreme Personality of Godhead playing as a human child and that His life was not in danger under
any circumstances. Rather, because of their intense parental love for Krsna, they thought that Krsna was an
innocent child and had been saved by the Supreme Lord.
In the material world, because of intense lust and desire for enjoyment, one becomes implicated in sinful life
more and more (kama esa krodha esa rajo-guna-samudbhavah). Therefore the quality of fear is one of the aspects
of material life (ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunam ca). But if one becomes Krsna conscious, the process of devotional
service, sravanam kirtanam, diminishes one's polluted life of material existence, and one is purified and protected
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah. In devotional life,
one has faith in this process. Such faith is one of the six kinds of surrender. Raksisyatiti visvasah (Hari-bhaktivilasa
11.676). One of the processes of surrender is that one should simply depend on Krsna, convinced that He
will give one all protection. That Krsna will protect His devotee is a fact, and Nanda Maharaja and the other
inhabitants of Vrndavana accepted this very simply, although they did not know that the Supreme Lord Himself
was present before them. There have been many instances in which a devotee like Prahlada Maharaja or Dhruva
Maharaja has been put in difficulty even by his father but has been saved under all circumstances. Therefore our
only business is to become Krsna conscious and depend fully on Krsna for all protection.

Nanda Maharaja and the others said: We must previously have performed austerities for a very long time,
worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed pious activities for public life, constructing public
roads and wells, and also given charity, as a result of which this boy, although faced with death, has returned to
give happiness to His relatives.
Nanda Maharaja confirmed that by pious activities one can become a sadhu so that one will be happy at home
and one's children will be protected. In sastra there are many injunctions for karmis and jnanis, especially for
karmis, by which they can become pious and happy even in material life. According to Vedic civilization, one
should perform activities for the benefit of the public, such as constructing public roads, planting trees on both
sides of the road so that people can walk in the shade, and constructing public wells so that everyone can take
water without difficulty. One should perform austerity to control one's desires, and one must simultaneously
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one becomes pious, and as a result one is happy even in
material conditions of life.

O King Pariksit, when the child Krsna was almost finished drinking His mother's milk and mother Yasoda was
touching Him and looking at His beautiful, brilliantly smiling face, the baby yawned, and mother Yasoda saw in His
mouth the whole sky, the higher planetary system and the earth, the luminaries in all directions, the sun, the
moon, fire, air, the seas, islands, mountains, rivers, forests, and all kinds of living entities, moving and nonmoving.
By the arrangement of yogamaya, Krsna's pastimes with mother Yasoda were all regarded as ordinary. So here was
an opportunity for Krsna to show His mother that the whole universe is situated within Him. In His small form,
Krsna was kind enough to show His mother the virat-rupa, the universal form, so that she could enjoy seeing what
kind of child she had on her lap. The rivers have been mentioned here as the daughters of the mountains (nagams
tad-duhitrh). It is the flowing of the rivers that makes big forests possible. There are living entities everywhere,
some of them moving and some of them not moving. No place is vacant. This is a special feature of God's creation.

When mother Yasoda saw the whole universe within the mouth of her child, her heart began to throb, and in
astonishment she wanted to close her restless eyes.
Because of her pure maternal love, mother Yasoda thought that this wonderful child playing so many tricks must
have had some disease. She did not appreciate the wonders shown by her child; rather, she wanted to close her
eyes. She was expecting another danger, and therefore her eyes became restless like those of a deer cub. This was
all the arrangement of yogamaya. The relationship between mother Yasoda and Krsna is one of pure maternal love.
In that love, mother Yasoda did not very much appreciate the display of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's
opulences.
At the beginning of this chapter, two extra verses sometimes appear:
evam bahuni karmani
gopanam sam sa-yositam
nandasya gehe vavrdhe
kurvan visnu-janardanah
"In this way, to chastise and kill the demons, the child Krsna demonstrated many activities in the house of Nanda
Maharaja, and the inhabitants of Vraja enjoyed these incidents."
evam sa vavrdhe visnur
nanda-gehe janardanah
kurvann anisam anandam
gopalanam sa-yositam
"To increase the transcendental pleasure of the gopas and the gopis, Krsna, the killer of all demons, was thus
raised by His father and mother, Nanda and Yasoda."
Sripada Vijayadhvaja Tirtha also adds another verse after the third verse in this chapter:
vistareneha karunyat
sarva-papa-pranasanam
vaktum arhasi dharma-jna
dayalus tvam iti prabho
"Pariksit Maharaja then requested Sukadeva Gosvami to continue speaking such narrations about the pastimes of
Krsna, so that the King could enjoy from them transcendental bliss."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Killing of the Demon Trnavarta."
Chapter Eight
Lord Krsna Shows the Universal Form Within His Mouth
The summary of the Eighth Chapter is as follows. This chapter describes the ceremony of giving a name to Krsna.
It also describes His crawling, His playing with the cows, and His eating earth and again showing the universal
form to His mother.
One day, Vasudeva sent for Gargamuni, the family priest of the yadu-vamsa, and thus Gargamuni went to the
house of Nanda Maharaja, who received him very well and requested him to give names to Krsna and Balarama.
Gargamuni, of course, reminded Nanda Maharaja that Kamsa was looking for the son of Devaki and said that if he
performed the ceremony very gorgeously, the ceremony would come to the notice of Kamsa, who would then
suspect that Krsna was the son of Devaki. Nanda Maharaja therefore requested Gargamuni to perform this
ceremony without anyone's knowledge, and Gargamuni did so. Because Balarama, the son of Rohini, increases the
transcendental bliss of others, His name is Rama, and because of His extraordinary strength, He is called Baladeva.
He attracts the Yadus to follow His instructions, and therefore His name is Sankarsana. Krsna, the son of Yasoda,
previously appeared in many other colors, such as white, red and yellow, and He had now assumed the color black.
Because He was sometimes the son of Vasudeva, His name is Vasudeva. According to His various activities and
qualities, He has many other names. After thus informing Nanda Maharaja and completing the name-giving
ceremony, Gargamuni advised Nanda Maharaja to protect his son very carefully and then departed.
Sukadeva Gosvami next described how the two children crawled, walked on Their small legs, played with the
cows and calves, stole butter and other milk products and broke the butter pots. In this way, he described many
naughty activities of Krsna and Balarama. The most wonderful of these occurred when Krsna's playmates
complained to mother Yasoda that Krsna was eating earth. Mother Yasoda wanted to open Krsna's mouth to see the
evidence so that she could chastise Him. Sometimes she assumed the position of a chastising mother, and at the
next moment she was overwhelmed with maternal love. After describing all this to Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva
Gosvami, at Maharaja Pariksit's request, praised the fortune of mother Yasoda and Nanda. Nanda and Yasoda were
formerly Drona and Dhara, and by the order of Brahma they came to this earth and had the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as their son.

especially householders; dina-cetasam--who are very simple-minded, being engaged in family maintenance and
nothing more; nihsreyasaya--a great personality has no reason to go to the grhastha but to benefit him; bhagavan--
O most powerful devotee; kalpate--is to be taken that way; na anyatha--not for any other purpose; kvacit--at any

O my lord, O great devotee, persons like you move from one place to another not for their own interests but for
the sake of poor-hearted grhasthas [householders]. Otherwise they have no interest in going from one place to
another.
As factually stated by Nanda Maharaja, Gargamuni, being a devotee, had no needs. Similarly, when Krsna comes
He has no needs, for He is purna, atmarama. Nonetheless, He descends to this material world to protect the
devotees and vanquish miscreants (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam). This is the mission of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and devotees also have the same mission. One who executes this mission of paraupakara,
performing welfare activities for people in general, is recognized by Krsna, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, as being very, very dear to Him (na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah). Similarly, Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has advised this para-upakara, and He has especially advised the inhabitants of India:
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
"One who has taken his birth as a human being in the land of India [Bharata-varsa] should make his life
successful and work for the benefit of all other people." (Cc. Adi 9.41) On the whole, the duty of a pure Vaisnava
devotee is to act for the welfare of others.
Nanda Maharaja could understand that Gargamuni had come for this purpose and that his own duty now was to
act according to Gargamuni's advice. Thus he said, "Please tell me what is my duty." This should be the attitude of
everyone, especially the householder. The varnasrama society is organized into eight divisions: brahmana, ksatriya,
vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Nanda Maharaja represented himself as grhinam,
a householder. A brahmacari factually has no needs, but grhi, householders, are engaged in sense gratification. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.44), bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam tayapahrta-cetasam. Everyone has come to this material
world for sense gratification, and the position of those who are too attached to sense gratification and who
therefore accept the grhastha-asrama is very precarious. Since everyone in this material world is searching for sense
gratification, grhasthas are required to be trained as mahat, great mahatmas. Therefore Nanda Maharaja specifically
used the word mahad-vicalanam. Gargamuni had no interest to serve by going to Nanda Maharaja, but Nanda
Maharaja, as a grhastha, was always perfectly ready to receive instructions from a mahatma to gain the real benefit
in life. Thus he was ready to execute Gargamuni's order.

civilized society, there must be knowledge of astrology); ayanam--the movements of the stars and planets in
relationship to human society; saksat--directly; yat tat jnanam--such knowledge; ati-indriyam--which an ordinary

O great saintly person, you have compiled the astrological knowledge by which one can understand past and
present unseen things. By the strength of this knowledge, any human being can understand what he has done in
his past life and how it affects his present life. This is known to you.
The word "destiny" is now defined. Unintelligent persons who do not understand the meaning of life are just like
animals. Animals do not know the past, present and future of life, nor are they able to understand it. But a human
being can understand this, if he is sober. Therefore, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.13), dhiras tatra na muhyati: a
sober person is not bewildered. The simple truth is that although life is eternal, in this material world one changes
from one body to another. Foolish people, especially in this age, do not understand this simple truth. Krsna says:
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly
passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change." (Bg. 2.13) Krsna, the
greatest authority, says that the body will change. And as soon as the body changes, one's whole program of work
changes also. Today I am a human being or a great personality, but with a little deviation from nature's law, I shall
have to accept a different type of body. Today I am a human being, but tomorrow I may become a dog, and then
whatever activities I have performed in this life will be a failure. This simple truth is now rarely understood, but
one who is a dhira can understand this. Those in this material world for material enjoyment should know that
because their present position will cease to exist, they must be careful in how they act. This is also stated by
Rsabhadeva. Na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam asann api klesada asa dehah (Bhag. 5.5.4). Although this body is
temporary, as long as we have to live in this body we must suffer. Whether one has a short life or a long life, one
must suffer the threefold miseries of material life. Therefore any gentleman, dhira, must be interested in jyotisa,
astrology.
Nanda Maharaja was trying to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Gargamuni's presence, for
Gargamuni was a great authority in this knowledge of astrology, by which one can see the unseen events of past,
present and future. It is the duty of a father to understand the astrological position of his children and do what is
needed for their happiness. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of Gargamuni,
Nanda Maharaja suggested that Gargamuni prepare a horoscope for Nanda's two sons, Krsna and Balarama.

(brahma janatiti brahmanah); sresthah--you are the best; samskaran--ceremonies performed for reformation
(because by these reformatory activities one takes one's second birth: samskarad bhaved dvijah); kartum arhasi--
because you have kindly come here, kindly execute; balayoh--of these two sons (Krsna and Balarama); anayoh--of
both of Them; nrnam--not only of Them, but of all human society; janmana--as soon as he takes birth;
brahmanah--immediately the brahmana becomes; guruh--the guide. *
My lord, you are the best of the brahmanas, especially because you are fully aware of the jyotih-sastra, the
astrological science. Therefore you are naturally the spiritual master of every human being. This being so, since you
have kindly come to my house, kindly execute the reformatory activities for my two sons.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam gunakarma-
vibhagasah: the four varnas--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--must be present in society. The
brahmanas are required for the guidance of the whole society. If there is no such institution as varnasrama-dharma
and if human society has no such guide as the brahmana, human society will be hellish. In Kali-yuga, especially at
the present moment, there is no such thing as a real brahmana, and therefore society is in a chaotic condition.
Formerly there were qualified brahmanas, but at present, although there are certainly persons who think
themselves brahmanas, they actually have no ability to guide society. The Krsna consciousness movement is
therefore very much eager to reintroduce the varnasrama system into human society so that those who are
bewildered or less intelligent will be able to take guidance from qualified brahmanas.
Brahmana means Vaisnava. After one becomes a brahmana, the next stage of development in human society is to
become a Vaisnava. People in general must be guided to the destination or goal of life, and therefore they must
understand Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole system of Vedic knowledge is based on this
principle, but people have lost the clue (na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum), and they are simply pursuing sense
gratification, with the risk of gliding down to a lower grade of life (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani). It doesn't matter
whether one is born a brahmana or not. No one is born a brahmana; everyone is born a sudra. But by the guidance
of a brahmana and by samskara, one can become dvija, twice-born, and then gradually become a brahmana.
Brahmanism is not a system meant to create a monopoly for a particular class of men. Everyone should be educated
so as to become a brahmana. At least there must be an opportunity to allow everyone to attain the destination of
life. Regardless of whether one is born in a brahmana family, a ksatriya family or a sudra family, one may be guided
by a proper brahmana and be promoted to the highest platform of being a Vaisnava. Thus the Krsna consciousness
movement affords an opportunity to develop the right destiny for human society. Nanda Maharaja took advantage
of the opportunity of Gargamuni's presence by requesting him to perform the necessary reformatory activities for
his sons to guide Them toward the destination of life.

Gargamuni said: My dear Nanda Maharaja, I am the priestly guide of the Yadu dynasty. This is known
everywhere. Therefore, if I perform the purificatory process for your sons, Kamsa will consider Them the sons of
Devaki.
Gargamuni indirectly disclosed that Krsna was the son of Devaki, not of Yasoda. Since Kamsa was already
searching for Krsna, if the purificatory process were undertaken by Gargamuni, Kamsa might be informed, and that
would create a catastrophe. It may be argued that although Gargamuni was the priest of the Yadu dynasty, Nanda
Maharaja also belonged to that dynasty. Nanda Maharaja, however, was not acting as a ksatriya. Therefore
Gargamuni said, "If I act as your priest, this will confirm that Krsna is the son of Devaki."

Kamsa is both a great diplomat and a very sinful man. Therefore, having heard from Yogamaya, the daughter of
Devaki, that the child who will kill him has already been born somewhere else, having heard that the eighth
pregnancy of Devaki could not bring forth a female child, and having understood your friendship with Vasudeva,
Kamsa, upon hearing that the purificatory process has been performed by me, the priest of the Yadu dynasty, may
certainly consider all these points and suspect that Krsna is the son of Devaki and Vasudeva. Then he might take
steps to kill Krsna. That would be a catastrophe.
Kamsa knew very well that Yogamaya was, after all, the maidservant of Krsna and Visnu and that although
Yogamaya had appeared as the daughter of Devaki, she might have been forbidden to disclose this fact. Actually
this was what had happened. Gargamuni argued very soberly that his taking part in performing the reformatory
process for Krsna would give rise to many doubts, so that Kamsa might take very severe steps to kill the child.
Kamsa had already sent many demons to attempt to kill this child, but none of them had survived. If Gargamuni
were to perform the purificatory process, Kamsa's suspicions would be fully confirmed, and he would take very
severe steps. Gargamuni gave this warning to Nanda Maharaja.

in the cow shed; kuru--just execute; dvijati-samskaram--the purificatory process of second birth (samskarad
bhaved dvijah); svasti-vacana-purvakam--by chanting the Vedic hymns to perform the purificatory process.
Nanda Maharaja said: My dear great sage, if you think that your performing this process of purification will make
Kamsa suspicious, then secretly chant the Vedic hymns and perform the purifying process of second birth here in
the cow shed of my house, without the knowledge of anyone else, even my relatives, for this process of purification
is essential.
Nanda Maharaja did not like the idea of avoiding the purificatory process. Despite the many obstacles, he wanted
to take advantage of Gargamuni's presence and do what was needed. The purificatory process is essential
specifically for brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. Therefore, since Nanda Maharaja presented himself as a vaisya,
this process of purification was essential. Formerly, such institutional activities were compulsory. Catur-varnyam
maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg. 4.13). Without these activities of purification, the society would be
considered a society of animals. To take advantage of Gargamuni's presence, Nanda Maharaja wanted to perform
the nama-karana ceremonies, even secretly, without any gorgeous arrangements. Therefore, the opportunity for
purification should be regarded as the essential duty of human society. In Kali-yuga, however, people have
forgotten the essence. Mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (Bhag. 1.1.10). In this age, people are
all bad and unfortunate, and they do not accept Vedic instructions to make their life successful. Nanda Maharaja,
however, did not want to neglect anything. To keep intact a happy society advanced in spiritual knowledge, he
took full advantage of Gargamuni's presence to do what was necessary. How degraded society has become within
five thousand years. Mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagyah. The human life is obtained after many, many
millions of births, and it is intended for purification. Previously, a father was eager to give all kinds of help to
elevate his children, but at present, because of being misguided, people are prepared even to kill to avoid the
responsibility of raising children.

Gargamuni said: This child, the son of Rohini, will give all happiness to His relatives and friends by His
transcendental qualities. Therefore He will be known as Rama. And because He will manifest extraordinary bodily
strength, He will also be known as Bala. Moreover, because He unites two families--Vasudeva's family and the
family of Nanda Maharaja--He will be known as Sankarsana.
Baladeva was actually the son of Devaki, but He was transferred from Devaki's womb to that of Rohini. This fact
was not disclosed. According to a statement in the Hari-vamsa:
pratyuvaca tato ramah
sarvams tan abhitah sthitan
yadavesv api sarvesu
bhavanto mama vallabhah
Gargamuni did disclose to Nanda Maharaja that Balarama would be known as Sankarsana because of uniting two
families--the yadu-vamsa and the vamsa of Nanda Maharaja--one of which was known as ksatriya and the other as
vaisya. Both families had the same original forefather, the only difference being that Nanda Maharaja was born of a
vaisya wife whereas Vasudeva was born of a ksatriya wife. Later, Nanda Maharaja married a vaisya wife, and
Vasudeva married a ksatriya wife. So although the families of Nanda Maharaja and Vasudeva both came from the
same father, they were divided as ksatriya and vaisya. Now Baladeva united them, and therefore He was known as
Sankarsana.

asan varnas trayo hy asya
grhnato 'nuyugam tanuh
suklo raktas tatha pita
idanim krsnatam gatah
asan--were assumed; varnah trayah--three colors; hi--indeed; asya--of your son Krsna; grhnatah--accepting;
anuyugam tanuh--transcendental bodies according to the different yugas; suklah--sometimes white; raktah--
sometimes red; tatha--as well as; pitah--sometimes yellow; idanim krsnatam gatah--at the present moment He has
assumed a blackish color.
Your son Krsna appears as an incarnation in every millennium. In the past, He assumed three different colors--
white, red and yellow--and now He has appeared in a blackish color. [In another Dvapara-yuga, He appeared (as
Lord Ramacandra) in the color of suka, a parrot. All such incarnations have now assembled in Krsna.]
Partially explaining the position of Lord Krsna and partially covering the facts, Gargamuni indicated, "Your son is
a great personality, and He can change the color of His body in different ages." The word grhnatah indicates that
Krsna is free to make His choice. In other words, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and may therefore do
whatever He desires. In Vedic literature the different colors assumed by the Personality of Godhead in different
millenniums are stated, and therefore when Gargamuni said, "Your son has assumed these colors," he indirectly
said, "He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Because of Kamsa's atrocities, Gargamuni tried to avoid
disclosing this fact, but he indirectly informed Nanda Maharaja that Krsna, his son, was the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
It may be noted that Srila Jiva Gosvami, in his book Krama-sandarbha, has enunciated the purport of this verse.
In every millennium, Krsna appears in a different form, either as white, red or yellow, but this time He personally
appeared in His original, blackish form and, as predicted by Gargamuni, exhibited the power of Narayana. Because
in this form the Supreme personality of Godhead exhibits Himself fully, His name is Sri Krsna, the all-attractive.
Factually, Krsna is the source of all avataras, and therefore all the different features of the different avataras are
present in Krsna. When Krsna incarnates, all the features of other incarnations are already present within Him.
Other incarnations are partial representations of Krsna, who is the full-fledged incarnation of the Supreme Being. It
is to be understood that the Supreme Being, whether appearing as sukla, rakta or pita (white, red or yellow), is the
same person. When He appears in different incarnations, He appears in different colors, just like the sunshine,
which contains seven colors. Sometimes the colors of sunshine are represented separately; otherwise the sunshine
is observed mainly as bright light. The different avataras, such as the manvantara-avataras, lila-avataras and dasaavataras,
are all included in the krsna-avatara. When Krsna appears, all the avataras appear with Him. As described
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.3.26):
avatara hy asankhyeya
hareh sattva-nidher dvijah
yathavidasinah kulyah
sarasah syuh sahasrasah
The avataras incessantly appear, like incessantly flowing water. No one can count how many waves there are in
flowing water, and similarly there is no limitation of the avataras. And Krsna is the full representation of all
avataras because He is the source of all avataras. Krsna is amsi, whereas others are amsa, part of Krsna. All living
entities, including us, are amsas (mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah). These amsas are of different
magnitude. Human beings (who are minute amsas) and the demigods, visnu-tattva and all other living beings are
all part of the Supreme. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). Krsna is the full
representation of all living entities, and when Krsna is present, all avataras are included in Him.
The Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the incarnations for each yuga in chronological order. The
Bhagavatam says, krte suklas catur-bahuh, tretayam rakta-varno'sau, dvapare bhagavan syamah and krsna-varnam
tvisakrsnam. We actually see that in Kali-yuga, Bhagavan has appeared in pita-varna, or a yellow color, as
Gaurasundara, although the Bhagavatam speaks of krsna-varnam. To adjust all these statements, one should
understand that although in some yugas some of the colors are prominent, in every yuga, whenever Krsna appears,
all the colors are present. Krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam: although Caitanya Mahaprabhu appears without krsna, or a
blackish color, He is understood to be Krsna Himself. Idanim krsnatam gatah. The same original Krsna who
appears in different varnas has now appeared. The word asan indicates that He is always present. Whenever the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appears in His full feature, He is understood to be krsna-varnam, although He
appears in different colors. Prahlada Maharaja states that Caitanya Mahaprabhu is channa; that is, although He is
Krsna, He is covered by a yellow color. Thus the Gaudiya Vaisnavas accept the conclusion that although Caitanya
Mahaprabhu appeared in pita color, He is Krsna.

For this son of yours there are many forms and names according to His transcendental qualities and activities.
These are known to me, but people in general do not understand them.
Bahuni: the Lord has many names. Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam adyam purana-purusam navayauvanam
ca. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33), the Lord is one, but He has many forms and many names. It
was not that because Gargamuni gave the child the name Krsna, that was His only name. He has other names, such
as Bhaktavatsala, Giridhari, Govinda and Gopala. If we analyze the nirukti, or semantic derivation, of the word
"Krsna," we find that na signifies that He stops the repetition of birth and death, and krs means sattartha, or
"existence." (Krsna is the whole of existence.) Also, krs means "attraction," and na means ananda, or "bliss." Krsna
is known as Mukunda because He wants to give everyone spiritual, eternal, blissful life. Unfortunately, because of
the living entity's little independence, the living entity wants to "deprogram" the program of Krsna. This is the
material disease. Nonetheless, because Krsna wants to give transcendental bliss to the living entities, He appears in
various forms. Therefore He is called Krsna. Because Gargamuni was an astrologer, he knew what others did not
know. Yet Krsna has so many names that even Gargamuni did not know them all. It is to be concluded that Krsna,
according to His transcendental activities, has many names and many forms.

In conclusion, therefore, O Nanda Maharaja, this child of yours is as good as Narayana. In His transcendental
qualities, opulence, name, fame and influence, He is exactly like Narayana. You should all raise this child very
carefully and cautiously.
In this verse, the word narayana-samah is significant. Narayana has no equal. He is asamaurdhva: no one is equal
to Him, and no one is greater than He is. As stated in sastra:
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
One who equates Narayana even with great exalted demigods like Lord Siva or Lord Brahma is a pasandi, an
agnostic. No one can equal Narayana. Nonetheless, Gargamuni used the word sama, meaning "equal," because he
wanted to treat Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who had become Nanda Maharaja's son. Gargamuni
wanted to impress upon the mind of Nanda Maharaja, "Your worshipable Deity, Narayana, is so pleased with you
that He has sent you a son almost equal to Him in qualifications. Therefore you may designate your son with a
similar name, such as Mukunda or Madhusudana. But you must always remember that whenever you want to do
something very good, there will be many hindrances. Therefore you should raise and protect this child with great
care. If you can protect this child very cautiously, as Narayana always protects you, the child will be as good as
Narayana." Gargamuni also indicated that although the child was exaltedly qualified like Narayana, He would
enjoy more than Narayana as rasa-vihari, the central enjoyer of the rasa dance. As stated in the Brahma-samhita,
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam: He would be served by many gopis, who would all be as good as the
goddess of fortune.

After a short time passed, both brothers, Rama and Krsna, began to crawl on the ground of Vraja with the
strength of Their hands and knees and thus enjoy Their childhood play.
One brahmana devotee says:
srutim apare smrtim itare bharatam anye bhajantu bhava-bhitah
aham iha nandam vande yasyalinde param brahma
"Let others, fearing material existence, worship the Vedas, the Vedic supplementary puranas and the
Mahabharata, but I shall worship Nanda Maharaja, in whose courtyard the Supreme Brahman is crawling." For a
highly exalted devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence of the Supreme, appears no better than hell
(narakayate). But here one can simply think of the crawling of Krsna and Balarama in the courtyard of Nanda
Maharaja and always merge in transcendental happiness. As long as one is absorbed in thoughts of krsna-lila,
especially Krsna's childhood pastimes, as Pariksit Maharaja desired to be, one is always merged in actual kaivalya.
Therefore Vyasadeva compiled Srimad-Bhagavatam. Lokasyajanato vidvams cakre satvata-samhitam (Bhag. 1.7.6).
Vyasadeva compiled Srimad-Bhagavatam, under the instruction of Narada, so that anyone can take advantage of
this literature, think of Krsna's pastimes and always be liberated.

these were not Their mothers They were following, and They would return to Their actual mothers. Thus the

teeth were visible. Their mothers, upon seeing those beautiful teeth, enjoyed great transcendental bliss.
As the mothers cared for their respective babies, by the arrangement of yogamaya the babies thought, "Here is My
mother," and the mothers thought, "Here is my son." Because of affection, milk naturally flowed from the mothers'
breasts, and the babies drank it. When the mothers saw small teeth coming in, they would count them and be
happy, and when the babies saw Their mothers allowing Them to drink their breast milk, the babies also felt
transcendental pleasure. As this transcendental affection continued between Rohini and Balarama and Yasoda and
Krsna, they all enjoyed transcendental bliss.

on the ground, they were always in anxiety, and their household engagements were disturbed. At that time, they
were fully equipoised in the transcendental ecstasy known as the distress of material affection, for this was aroused
within their minds.
All these pastimes of Krsna, and the great enjoyment exhibited by the mothers, are transcendental; nothing about
them is material. They are described in the Brahma-samhita as ananda-cinmaya-rasa. In the spiritual world there is
anxiety, there is crying, and there are other feelings similar to those of the material world, but because the reality of
these feelings is in the transcendental world, of which this world is only an imitation, mother Yasoda and Rohini
enjoyed them transcendentally.

Krsna's activities are always very attractive to devotees. Therefore the neighbors, who were friends of mother
Yasoda, informed mother Yasoda of whatever they saw Krsna doing in the neighborhood. Mother Yasoda, just to

"Our dear friend Yasoda, your son sometimes comes to our houses before the milking of the cows and releases
the calves, and when the master of the house becomes angry, your son merely smiles. Sometimes He devises some
process by which He steals palatable curd, butter and milk, which He then eats and drinks. When the monkeys
assemble, He divides it with them, and when the monkeys have their bellies so full that they won't take more, He
breaks the pots. Sometimes, if He gets no opportunity to steal butter or milk from a house, He will be angry at the
householders, and for His revenge He will agitate the small children by pinching them. Then, when the children
begin crying, Krsna will go away.
The narration of Krsna's naughty childhood activities would be presented to mother Yasoda in the form of
complaints. Sometimes Krsna would enter the house of a neighbor, and if He found no one there, He would release
the calves before the time for the cows to be milked. The calves are actually supposed to be released when their
mothers are milked, but Krsna would release them before that time, and naturally the calves would drink all the
milk from their mothers. When the cowherd men saw this, they would chase Krsna and try to catch Him, saying,
"Here is Krsna doing mischief," but He would flee and enter another house, where He would again devise some
means to steal butter and curd. Then the cowherd men would again try to capture Him, saying, "Here is the butter
thief. Better capture Him!" And they would be angry. But Krsna would simply smile, and they would forget
everything. Sometimes, in their presence, He would begin eating the curd and butter. There was no need for Krsna
to eat butter, since His belly was always full, but He would try to eat it, or else He would break the pots and
distribute the contents to the monkeys. In this way, Krsna was always engaged in mischief-making. If in any house
He could not find any butter or curd to steal, He would go into a room and agitate the small children sleeping there
by pinching them, and when they cried He would go away.

"When the milk and curd are kept high on a swing hanging from the ceiling and Krsna and Balarama cannot
reach it, They arrange to reach it by piling up various planks and turning upside down the mortar for grinding
spices. Being quite aware of the contents of a pot, They pick holes in it. While the elderly gopis go about their
household affairs, Krsna and Balarama sometimes go into a dark room, brightening the place with the valuable
jewels and ornaments on Their bodies and taking advantage of this light by stealing.
Formerly, in every household, yogurt and butter were kept for use in emergencies. But Krsna and Balarama
would pile up planks so that They could reach the pots and would then pick holes in the pots with Their hands so
that the contents would leak out and They could drink it. This was another means for stealing butter and milk.
When the butter and milk were kept in a dark room, Krsna and Balarama would go there and make the place bright
with the valuable jewels on Their bodies. On the whole, Krsna and Balarama engaged in stealing butter and milk
from the neighborhood houses in many ways.

"When Krsna is caught in His naughty activities, the master of the house will say to Him, 'Oh, You are a thief,'
and artificially express anger at Krsna. Krsna will then reply, 'I am not a thief. You are a thief.' Sometimes, being
angry, Krsna passes urine and stool in a neat, clean place in our houses. But now, our dear friend Yasoda, this
expert thief is sitting before you like a very good boy." Sometimes all the gopis would look at Krsna sitting there,
His eyes fearful so that His mother would not chastise Him, and when they saw Krsna's beautiful face, instead of
chastising Him they would simply look upon His face and enjoy transcendental bliss. Mother Yasoda would mildly
smile at all this fun, and she would not want to chastise her blessed transcendental child.
Krsna's business in the neighborhood was not only to steal but sometimes to pass stool and urine in a neat, clean
house. When caught by the master of the house, Krsna would chastise him, saying, "You are a thief." Aside from
being a thief in His childhood affairs, Krsna acted as an expert thief when He was young by attracting young girls
and enjoying them in the rasa dance. This is Krsna's business. He is also violent, as the killer of many demons.
Although mundane people like nonviolence and other such brilliant qualities, God, the Absolute Truth, being
always the same, is good in any activities, even so-called immoral activities like stealing, killing and violence. Krsna
is always pure, and He is always the Supreme Absolute Truth. Krsna may do anything supposedly abominable in
material life, yet still He is attractive. Therefore His name is Krsna, meaning "all-attractive." This is the platform on
which transcendental loving affairs and service are exchanged. Because of the features of Krsna's face, the mothers
were so attracted that they could not chastise Him. Instead of chastising Him, they smiled and enjoyed hearing of
Krsna's activities. Thus the gopis remained satisfied, and Krsna enjoyed their happiness. Therefore another name of
Krsna is Gopi-jana-vallabha because He invented such activities to please the gopis.

Mother Yasoda was agitated by Krsna's restless misbehavior. Her house was full of sweetmeats. Why then should
the restless boy eat dirt in a solitary place? Krsna replied, "My dear mother, they have plotted together and lodged a

Lord Sri Krsna replied: My dear mother, I have never eaten dirt. All My friends complaining against Me are liars.
If you think they are being truthful, you can directly look into My mouth and examine it.
Krsna presented Himself as an innocent child to increase the transcendental ecstasy of maternal affection. As
described in the sastra, tadana-bhayan mithyoktir vatsalya-rasa-posika. This means that sometimes a small child
speaks lies. For example, he may have stolen something or eaten something and yet deny that he has done so. We
ordinarily see this in the material world, but in relation to Krsna it is different; such activities are meant to endow
the devotee with transcendental ecstasy. The Supreme Personality of Godhead was playing as a liar and accusing all
the other devotees of being liars. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.12.11), krta-punya-punjah: a devotee may
attain such an ecstatic position after many, many births of devotional service. Persons who have amassed the
results of a vast amount of pious activities can attain the stage of associating with Krsna and playing with Him like
ordinary playmates. One should not consider these transactions of transcendental service to be untruthful
accusations. One should never accuse such devotees of being ordinary boys speaking lies, for they attained this
stage of associating with Krsna by great austerities (tapasa brahmacaryena samena ca damena ca).

Mother Yasoda challenged Krsna, "If You have not eaten earth, then open Your mouth wide." When challenged
by His mother in this way, Krsna, the son of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, to exhibit pastimes like a human child,
opened His mouth. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is full of all opulences, did not
disturb His mother's parental affection, His opulence was automatically displayed, for Krsna's opulence is never
lost at any stage, but is manifest at the proper time.
Without disturbing the ecstasy of His mother's affection, Krsna opened His mouth and displayed His own natural
opulences. When a person is given varieties of food, there may be a hundred and one varieties, but if one likes
ordinary saka, spinach, he prefers to eat that. Similarly, although Krsna was full of opulences, now, by the order of
mother Yasoda, He opened wide His mouth like a human child and did not neglect the transcendental humor of
maternal affection.

When Krsna opened His mouth wide by the order of mother Yasoda, she saw within His mouth all moving and
nonmoving entities, outer space, and all directions, along with mountains, islands, oceans, the surface of the earth,
the blowing wind, fire, the moon and the stars. She saw the planetary systems, water, light, air, sky, and creation by
transformation of ahankara. She also saw the senses, the mind, sense perception, and the three qualities goodness,
passion and ignorance. She saw the time allotted for the living entities, she saw natural instinct and the reactions of
karma, and she saw desires and different varieties of bodies, moving and nonmoving. Seeing all these aspects of the
cosmic manifestation, along with herself and Vrndavana-dhama, she became doubtful and fearful of her son's
nature.
All the cosmic manifestations that exist on the gross and subtle elements, as well as the means of their agitation,
the three gunas, the living entity, creation, maintenance, annihilation and everything going on in the external
energy of the Lord--all this comes from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. Everything is within the
control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10). Mayadhyaksena
prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: everything in the material nature (prakrti) works under His control. Because all these
manifestations come from Govinda, they could all be visible within the mouth of Govinda. Quite astonishingly,
mother Yasoda was afraid because of intense maternal affection. She could not believe that within the mouth of her
son such things could appear. Yet she saw them, and therefore she was struck with fear and wonder.

[Mother Yasoda began to argue within herself:] Is this a dream, or is it an illusory creation by the external
energy? Has this been manifested by my own intelligence, or is it some mystic power of my child?
When mother Yasoda saw this wonderful manifestation within the mouth of her child, she began to argue within
herself about whether it was a dream. Then she considered, "I am not dreaming, because my eyes are open. I am
actually seeing what is happening. I am not sleeping, nor am I dreaming. Then maybe this is an illusion created by
devamaya. But that is also not possible. What business would the demigods have showing such things to me? I am
an insignificant woman with no connection with the demigods. Why should they take the trouble to put me into
devamaya? That also is not possible." Then mother Yasoda considered whether the vision might be due to
bewilderment: "I am fit in health; I am not diseased. Why should there be any bewilderment? It is not possible that
my brain is deranged, since I am ordinarily quite fit to think. Then this vision must be due to some mystic power of
my son, as predicted by Gargamuni." Thus she finally concluded that the vision was due to her son's activities, and
nothing else.

not; vitarka-gocaram--beyond all arguments, reason and sense perception; cetah--by consciousness; manah--by
mind; karma--by activities; vacobhih--or by words; anjasa--taking all of them together, we cannot understand them;

Him everything emanates; su-durvibhavyam--beyond our sense perception or consciousness; pranata asmi--let me

Therefore let me surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer my obeisances unto Him, who is
beyond the conception of human speculation, the mind, activities, words and arguments, who is the original cause
of this cosmic manifestation, by whom the entire cosmos is maintained, and by whom we can conceive of its
existence. Let me simply offer my obeisances, for He is beyond my contemplation, speculation and meditation. He
is beyond all of my material activities.
One simply has to realize the greatness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should not try to understand
Him by any material means, subtle or gross. Mother Yasoda, being a simple woman, could not find out the real
cause of the vision; therefore, out of maternal affection, she simply offered obeisances unto the Supreme Lord to
protect her child. She could do nothing but offer obeisances to the Lord. It is said, acintyah khalu ye bhava na tams
tarkena yojayet (Mahabharata, Bhisma parva 5.22). One should not try to understand the supreme cause by
argument or reasoning. When we are beset by some problem for which we can find no reason, there is no
alternative than to surrender to the Supreme Lord and offer Him our respectful obeisances. Then our position will
be secure. This was the means adopted in this instance also by mother Yasoda. Whatever happens, the original
cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-karana-karanam). When the immediate cause cannot be
ascertained, let us simply offer our obeisances at the lotus feet of the Lord. Mother Yasoda concluded that the
wonderful things she saw within the mouth of her child were due to Him, although she could not clearly ascertain
the cause. Therefore when a devotee cannot ascertain the cause of suffering, he concludes:
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
(Bhag. 10.14.8)
The devotee accepts that it is due to his own past misdeeds that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has caused
him some small amount of suffering. Thus he offers obeisances to the Lord again and again. Such a devotee is
called mukti-pade sa daya-bhak; that is, he is guaranteed his liberation from this material world. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
We should know that material suffering due to the material body will come and go. Therefore we must tolerate
the suffering and proceed with discharging our duty as ordained by our spiritual master.

aham mamasau patir esa me suto

yan-mayayettham kumatih sa me gatih
aham--my existence ("I am something"); mama--my; asau--Nanda Maharaja; patih--husband; esah--this (Krsna);
me sutah--is my son; vraja-isvarasya--of my husband, Nanda Maharaja; akhila-vitta-pa--I am the possessor of
unlimited opulence and wealth; sati--because I am his wife; gopyah ca--and all the damsels of the cowherd men;
gopah--all the cowherd men (are my subordinates); saha-godhanah ca--with the cows and calves; me--my; yatmayaya--
all such things addressed by me are, after all, given by the mercy of the Supreme; ittham--thus; kumatih--I
am wrongly thinking they are my possessions; sah me gatih--He is therefore my only shelter (I am simply
instrumental).
It is by the influence of the Supreme Lord's maya that I am wrongly thinking that Nanda Maharaja is my
husband, that Krsna is my son, and that because I am the queen of Nanda Maharaja, all the wealth of cows and
calves are my possessions and all the cowherd men and their wives are my subjects. Actually, I also am eternally
subordinate to the Supreme Lord. He is my ultimate shelter.
Following in the footsteps of mother Yasoda, everyone should follow this mentality of renunciation. Whatever
wealth, opulence or whatever else we may possess belongs not to us but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is the ultimate shelter of everyone and the ultimate owner of everything. As stated by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets
and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material
miseries."
We should not be proud of our possessions. As expressed by mother Yasoda herein, "I am not the owner of
possessions, the opulent wife of Nanda Maharaja. The estate, the possessions, the cows and calves and the subjects
like the gopis and cowherd men are all given to me." One should give up thinking of "my possessions, my son and
my husband" (janasya moho'yam aham mameti). Nothing belongs to anyone but the Supreme Lord. Only because
of illusion do we wrongly think, "I am existing" or "Everything belongs to me." Thus mother Yasoda completely
surrendered unto the Supreme Lord. For the moment, she was rather disappointed, thinking, "My endeavors to
protect my son by charity and other auspicious activities are useless. The Supreme Lord has given me many things,
but unless He takes charge of everything, there is no assurance of protection. I must therefore ultimately seek
shelter of the Supreme personality of Godhead." As stated by Prahlada Maharaja (Bhag. 7.9.19), balasya neha
saranam pitarau nrsimha: a father and mother cannot ultimately take care of their children. Ato grha-ksetrasutapta-
vittair janasya moho 'yam aham mameti (Bhag. 5.5.8). One's land, home, wealth and all of one's
possessions belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we wrongly think, "I am this" and "These
things are mine."

vyatanot--expanded; mayam--yogamaya; putra-sneha-mayim--very much attached because of maternal affection for

Mother Yasoda, by the grace of the Lord, could understand the real truth. But then again, the supreme master, by
the influence of the internal potency, yogamaya, inspired her to become absorbed in intense maternal affection for
her son.
Although mother Yasoda understood the whole philosophy of life, at the next moment she was overwhelmed by
affection for her son by the influence of yogamaya. Unless she took care of her son Krsna, she thought, how could
He be protected? She could not think otherwise, and thus she forgot all her philosophical speculations. This
forgetfulness is described by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura as being inspired by the influence of yogamaya
(mohana-sadharmyan mayam). Materialistic persons are captivated by mahamaya, whereas devotees, by the
arrangement of the spiritual energy, are captivated by yogamaya.

Immediately forgetting yogamaya's illusion that Krsna had shown the universal form within His mouth, mother
Yasoda took her son on her lap as before, feeling increased affection in her heart for her transcendental child.
Mother Yasoda regarded the vision of the universal form within Krsna's mouth as an arrangement of yogamaya,
like a dream. As one forgets everything after a dream, mother Yasoda immediately forgot the entire incident. As her
natural feeling of affection increased, she decided to herself, "Now let this incident be forgotten. I do not mind.
Here is my son. Let me kiss Him."

Vedic knowledge of the Upanisads; sankhya-yogaih--by reading the literature of sankhya-yoga; ca--and; satvataih--

amanyata--considered (ordinary); atmajam--as her own son.
The glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are studied through the three Vedas, the Upanisads, the
literature of Sankhya-yoga, and other Vaisnava literature, yet mother Yasoda considered that Supreme Person her
ordinary child.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15) by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the purpose of studying the
Vedas is to understand Him (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained to Sanatana
Gosvami that there are three purposes in the Vedas. One is to understand our relationship with Krsna
(sambandha), another is to act according to that relationship (abhidheya), and the third is to reach the ultimate
goal (prayojana). The word prayojana means "necessities," and the ultimate necessity is explained by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. prema pum-artho mahan: the greatest necessity for a human being is the achievement of love for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here we see that mother Yasoda is on the highest stage of necessity, for she is
completely absorbed in love for Krsna.
In the beginning, the Vedic purpose is pursued in three ways (trayi)--by karma-kanda, jnana-kanda and upasanakanda.
When one reaches the complete, perfect stage of upasana-kanda, one comes to worship Narayana, or Lord
Visnu. When Parvati asked Lord Mahadeva, Lord Siva, what is the best method of upasana, or worship, Lord Siva
answered, aradhananam sarvesam visnor aradhanam param. Visnupasana, or visnv-aradhana, worship of Lord
Visnu, is the highest stage of perfection, as realized by Devaki. But here mother Yasoda performs no upasana, for
she has developed transcendental ecstatic love for Krsna. Therefore her position is better than that of Devaki. In
order to show this, Srila Vyasadeva enunciates this verse, trayya copanisadbhih etc.
When a human being enters into the study of the Vedas to obtain vidya, knowledge, he begins to take part in
human civilization. Then he advances further to study the Upanisads and gain brahma jnana, impersonal
realization of the Absolute Truth, and then he advances still further, to sankhya-yoga, in order to understand the
supreme controller, who is indicated in Bhagavad-gita (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam
bhavan.purusam sasvatam). When one understands that purusa, the supreme controller, to be Paramatma, one is
engaged in the method of yoga (dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah). But mother Yasoda has
surpassed all these stages. She has come to the platform of loving Krsna as her beloved child, and therefore she is
accepted to be on the highest stage of spiritual realization. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features
(brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate), but she is in such ecstasy that she does not care to understand what
is Brahman, what is Paramatma or what is Bhagavan. Bhagavan has personally descended to become her beloved
child. Therefore there is no comparison to mother Yasoda's good fortune, as declared by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
(ramya kacid upasana vrajavadhu-vargena ya kalpita). The Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
may be realized in different stages. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.11):
ye yatha mam prapadyante
tams tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah
"As men surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of
Prtha." One may be a karmi, a jnani, a yogi and then a bhakta or prema-bhakta. But the ultimate stage of realization
is prema-bhakti, as actually demonstrated by mother Yasoda.

Having heard of the great fortune of mother Yasoda, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O
learned brahmana, mother Yasoda's breast milk was sucked by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What past
auspicious activities did she and Nanda Maharaja perform to achieve such perfection in ecstatic love?
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.16), catur-vidha bhajante mam janah sukrtino 'rjuna. Without sukrti, or pious
activities, no one can come to the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is approached by four
kinds of pious men (arto jijnasur artharthi jnani ca), but here we see that Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda surpassed all
of them. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja naturally inquired, "What kind of pious activities did they perform in their
past lives by which they achieved such a stage of perfection?" Of course, Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda are accepted
as the father and mother of Krsna, yet mother Yasoda was more fortunate than Nanda Maharaja, Krsna's father,
because Nanda Maharaja was sometimes separated from Krsna whereas Yasoda, Krsna's mother, was not separated
from Krsna at any moment. From Krsna's babyhood to His childhood and from His childhood to His youth, mother
Yasoda was always in association with Krsna. Even when Krsna was grown up, He would go to Vrndavana and sit
on the lap of mother Yasoda. Therefore there is no comparison to the fortune of mother Yasoda, and Pariksit
Maharaja naturally inquired, yasoda ca maha-bhaga.

Although Krsna was so pleased with Vasudeva and Devaki that He descended as their son, they could not enjoy
Krsna's magnanimous childhood pastimes, which are so great that simply chanting about them vanquishes the
contamination of the material world. Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, however, enjoyed these pastimes fully, and
therefore their position is always better than that of Vasudeva and Devaki.
Krsna actually took birth from the womb of Devaki, but just after His birth He was transferred to the home of
mother Yasoda. Devaki could not even have Krsna suck her breast. Therefore Pariksit Maharaja was astonished.
How had mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja become so fortunate that they enjoyed the complete childhood
pastimes of Krsna, which are still glorified by saintly persons? What had they done in the past by which they were
elevated to such an exalted position?

demigod); pravarah--who was the best; dharaya--with Dhara; bharyaya--His wife; saha--with; karisyamanah--just to

Sukadeva Gosvami said: To follow the orders of Lord Brahma, Drona, the best of the Vasus, along with his wife,
Dhara, spoke to Lord Brahma in this way.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.37):
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuto
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
When Krsna descends anywhere, He is accompanied by His own associates. These associates are not ordinary
living beings. Krsna's pastimes are eternal, and when He descends, He comes with His associates. Therefore Nanda
and mother Yasoda are the eternal father and mother of Krsna. This means that whenever Krsna descends, Nanda
and Yasoda, as well as Vasudeva and Devaki, also descend as the Lord's father and mother. Their personalities are
expansions of Krsna's personal body; they are not ordinary living beings. Maharaja Pariksit knew this, but he was
curious to know from Sukadeva Gosvami whether it is possible for an ordinary human being to come to this stage
by sadhana-siddhi. There are two kinds of perfection--nitya-siddhi and sadhana-siddhi. A nitya-siddha is one who
is eternally Krsna's associate, an expansion of Krsna's personal body, whereas a sadhana-siddha is an ordinary
human being who, by executing pious activities and following regulative principles of devotional service, also
comes to that stage. Thus the purpose of Maharaja Pariksit's inquiry was to determine whether an ordinary human
being can attain the position of mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja. Sukadeva Gosvami answered this question as
follows.

planetary systems; harau--in the Supreme Lord; bhaktih--devotional service; syat--will be spread; parama--the
ultimate goal of life; loke--in the world; yaya--by which; anjah--very easily; durgatim--miserable life; taret--one can

Drona and Dhara said: Please permit us to be born on the planet earth so that after our appearance, the Supreme
Lord, the Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller and master of all planets, will also appear and spread
devotional service, the ultimate goal of life, so that those born in this material world may very easily be delivered
from the miserable condition of materialistic life by accepting this devotional service.
This statement by Drona clearly indicates that Drona and Dhara are the eternal father and mother of Krsna.
Whenever there is a necessity of Krsna's appearance, Drona and Dhara appear first, and then Krsna appears. Krsna
says in Bhagavad-gita that His birth is not ordinary (janma karma ca me divyam).
ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya
"Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all
sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form." (Bg. 4.6) Before Krsna's
appearance, Drona and Dhara appear in order to become His father and mother. It is they who appear as Nanda
Maharaja and his wife, Yasoda. In other words, it is not possible for a sadhana-siddha living being to become the
father or mother of Krsna, for Krsna's father and mother are already designated. But by following the principles
exhibited by Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda and their associates, the inhabitants of Vrndavana, ordinary living beings
may attain such affection as exhibited by Nanda and Yasoda.
When Drona and Dhara were requested to beget children, they chose to come to this world to have the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as their son, Krsna. Krsna's appearance means paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca
duskrtam--the devotees are protected, and the miscreants are vanquished. Whenever Krsna comes, He distributes
the highest goal of life, devotional service. He appears as Caitanya Mahaprabhu for the same purpose because
unless one comes to devotional service, one cannot be delivered from the miseries of the material world
(duhkhalayam asasvatam), where the living beings struggle for existence. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Because of conditioned life, they
are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entities are struggling to become
happy, but unless they take to the bhakti cult, their happiness is not possible. Krsna clearly says:
asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa
aprapya mam nivartante
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani
"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to
birth and death in this material world." (Bg. 9.3)
Foolish persons do not know how risky life is here if one does not follow the instructions of Krsna. The Krsna
consciousness movement, therefore, has been started so that by practicing Krsna consciousness one can avoid the
risky life of this material existence. There is no question of accepting or not accepting Krsna consciousness. It is
not optional; it is compulsory. If we do not take to Krsna consciousness, our life is very risky. Everything is
explained in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, to learn how to become free from the miserable condition of material
existence, Bhagavad-gita As It Is is the preliminary study. Then, if one understands Bhagavad-gita, one can proceed
to Srimad-Bhagavatam, and if one advances further, one may study Caitanya-caritamrta. We are therefore
presenting these invaluable books to the whole world so that people may study them and be happy, being delivered
from miserable conditional life.

of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, they maintained continuous, unswerving devotional love in parental affection. And
in their association, all the other inhabitants of Vrndavana, the gopas and gopis, developed the culture of krsnabhakti.
Although when the Supreme Personality of Godhead stole the butter, curd and milk of the neighboring gopas and
gopis this teasing superficially seemed troublesome, in fact it was an exchange of affection in the ecstasy of
devotional service. The more the gopas and gopis exchanged feelings with the Lord, the more their devotional
service increased. Sometimes we may superficially see that a devotee is in difficulty because of being engaged in
devotional service, but the fact is different. When a devotee suffers for Krsna, that suffering is transcendental
enjoyment. Unless one becomes a devotee, this cannot be understood. When Krsna exhibited His childhood
pastimes, not only did Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda increase their devotional affection, but those in their
association also increased in devotional service. In other words, persons who follow the activities of Vrndavana will
also develop devotional service in the highest perfection.

Chapter Nine
Mother Yasoda Binds Lord Lord Krsna
While mother Yasoda was allowing Krsna to drink her breast milk, she was forced to stop because she saw the
milk pan boiling over on the oven. The maidservants being engaged in other business, she stopped allowing Krsna
to drink from her breast and immediately attended to the overflowing milk pan. Krsna became very angry because
of His mother's behavior and devised a means of breaking the pots of yogurt. Because He created this disturbance,
mother Yasoda decided to bind Him. These incidents are described in this chapter.
One day, the maidservants being engaged in other work, mother Yasoda was churning the yogurt into butter
herself, and in the meantime Krsna came and requested her to allow Him to suck her breast milk. Of course,
mother Yasoda immediately allowed Him to do so, but then she saw that the hot milk on the oven was boiling over,
and therefore she immediately stopped allowing Krsna to drink the milk of her breast and went to stop the milk on
the oven from overflowing. Krsna, however, having been interrupted in His business of sucking the breast, was
very angry. He took a piece of stone, broke the churning pot and entered a room, where He began to eat the freshly
churned butter. When mother Yasoda, after attending to the overflowing milk, returned and saw the pot broken,
she could understand that this was the work of Krsna, and therefore she went to search for Him. When she entered
the room, she saw Krsna standing on the ulukhala, a large mortar for grinding spices. Having turned the mortar
upside down, He was stealing butter hanging from a swing and was distributing the butter to the monkeys. As soon
as Krsna saw that His mother had come, He immediately began to run away, and mother Yasoda began to follow
Him. After going some distance, mother Yasoda was able to catch Krsna, who because of His offense was crying.
Mother Yasoda, of course, threatened to punish Krsna if He acted that way again, and she decided to bind Him with
rope. Unfortunately, when the time came to knot the rope, the rope with which she wanted to bind Him was short
by a distance equal to the width of two fingers. When she made the rope longer by adding another rope, she again
saw that it was short by two fingers. Again and again she tried, and again and again she found the rope too short by
two fingers. Thus she became very tired, and Krsna, seeing His affectionate mother so tired, allowed Himself to be
bound. Now, being compassionate, He did not show her His unlimited potency. After mother Yasoda bound Krsna
and became engaged in other household affairs, Krsna observed two yamala-arjuna trees, which were actually
Nalakuvara and Manigriva, two sons of Kuvera who had been condemned by Narada Muni to become trees. Krsna,
by His mercy, now began to proceed toward the trees to fulfill the desire of Narada Muni.

activities.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, quoting from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Sanatana Gosvami, says that the
incident of Krsna's breaking the pot of yogurt and being bound by mother Yasoda took place on the Dipavali Day,
or Dipa-malika. Even today in India, this festival is generally celebrated very gorgeously in the month of Kartika by
fireworks and lights, especially in Bombay. It is to be understood that among all the cows of Nanda Maharaja,
several of mother Yasoda's cows ate only grasses so flavorful that the grasses would automatically flavor the milk.
Mother Yasoda wanted to collect the milk from these cows, make it into yogurt and churn it into butter personally,
since she thought that this child Krsna was going to the houses of neighborhood gopas and gopis to steal butter
because He did not like the milk and yogurt ordinarily prepared.
While churning the butter, mother Yasoda was singing about the childhood activities of Krsna. It was formerly a
custom that if one wanted to remember something constantly, he would transform it into poetry or have this done
by a professional poet. It appears that mother Yasoda did not want to forget Krsna's activities at any time. Therefore
she poeticized all of Krsna's childhood activities, such as the killing of Putana, Aghasura, Sakatasura and Trnavarta,
and while churning the butter, she sang about these activities in poetical form. This should be the practice of
persons eager to remain Krsna conscious twenty-four hours a day. This incident shows how Krsna conscious
mother Yasoda was. To stay in Krsna consciousness, we should follow such persons.

Dressed in a saffron-yellow sari, with a belt tied about her full hips, mother Yasoda pulled on the churning rope,
laboring considerably, her bangles and earrings moving and vibrating and her whole body shaking. Because of her
intense love for her child, her breasts were wet with milk. Her face, with its very beautiful eyebrows, was wet with
perspiration, and malati flowers were falling from her hair.
Anyone who desires to be Krsna conscious in motherly affection or parental affection should contemplate the
bodily features of mother Yasoda. It is not that one should desire to become like Yasoda, for this is Mayavada.
Either in parental affection or conjugal love, friendship or servitorship--in any way--we must follow in the
footsteps of the inhabitants of Vrndavana, not try to become like them. Therefore this description is provided here.
Advanced devotees must cherish this description, always thinking of mother Yasoda's features--how she was
dressed, how she was working and perspiring, how beautifully the flowers were arranged in her hair, and so on.
One should take advantage of the full description provided here by thinking of mother Yasoda in maternal affection
for Krsna.

Krsna was sleeping within the room, and as soon as He got up, He became hungry and went to His mother.
Wanting to stop her from churning and drink the milk of her breasts, He stopped her from moving the churning

Mother Yasoda then embraced Krsna, allowed Him to sit down on her lap, and began to look upon the face of the

she saw that the milk pan on the oven was boiling over, she immediately left her son to take care of the overflowing
milk, although the child was not yet fully satisfied with drinking the milk of His mother's breast.
Everything in the household affairs of mother Yasoda was meant for Krsna. Although Krsna was drinking the
breast milk of mother Yasoda, when she saw that the milk pan in the kitchen was overflowing, she had to take care
of it immediately, and thus she left her son, who then became very angry, not having been fully satisfied with
drinking the milk of her breast. Sometimes one must take care of more than one item of important business for the
same purpose. Therefore mother Yasoda was not unjust when she left her son to take care of the overflowing milk.
On the platform of love and affection, it is the duty of the devotee to do one thing first and other things later. The
proper intuition by which to do this is given by Krsna.

very cautiously approached Him from behind.
Mother Yasoda was able to trace Krsna by following His butter-smeared footprints. She saw that Krsna was
stealing butter, and thus she smiled. Meanwhile, the crows also entered the room and came out in fear. Thus

When Lord Sri Krsna saw His mother, stick in hand, He very quickly got down from the top of the mortar and
began to flee as if very much afraid. Although yogis try to capture Him as Paramatma by meditation, desiring to
enter into the effulgence of the Lord with great austerities and penances, they fail to reach Him. But mother Yasoda,
thinking that same Personality of Godhead, Krsna, to be her son, began following Krsna to catch Him.
Yogis, mystics, want to catch Krsna as Paramatma, and with great austerities and penances they try to approach
Him, yet they cannot. Here we see, however, that Krsna is going to be caught by Yasoda and is running away in
fear. This illustrates the difference between the bhakta and the yogi. Yogis cannot reach Krsna, but for pure
devotees like mother Yasoda, Krsna is already caught. Krsna was even afraid of mother Yasoda's stick. This was
mentioned by Queen Kunti in her prayers: bhaya-bhavanaya sthitasya (Bhag. 1.8.31). Krsna is afraid of mother
Yasoda, and yogis are afraid of Krsna. Yogis try to reach Krsna by jnana-yoga and other yogas, but fail. Yet although
mother Yasoda was a woman, Krsna was afraid of her, as clearly described in this verse.

While following Krsna, mother Yasoda, her thin waist overburdened by her heavy breasts, naturally had to
reduce her speed. Because of following Krsna very swiftly, her hair became loose, and the flowers in her hair were
falling after her. Yet she did not fail to capture her son Krsna.
Yogis cannot capture Krsna by severe penances and austerities, but mother Yasoda, despite all obstacles, was
finally able to catch Krsna without difficulty. This is the difference between a yogi and a bhakta. Yogis cannot enter
even the effulgence of Krsna. Yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-kotisu (Brahma-samhita 5.40). In that
effulgence there are millions of universes, but yogis and jnanis cannot enter that effulgence even after many, many
years of austerities, whereas bhaktas can capture Krsna simply by love and affection. This is the example shown
here by mother Yasoda. Krsna therefore confirms that if one wants to capture Him, one must undertake devotional
service.
bhaktya mam abhijanati

(Bg. 18.55)
Bhaktas enter even the planet of Krsna very easily, but the less intelligent yogis and jnanis, by their meditation,

catching; bhisayanti--mother Yasoda was threatening Him; avagurat--and thus she very mildly chastised Him.
When caught by mother Yasoda, Krsna became more and more afraid and admitted to being an offender. As she
looked upon Him, she saw that He was crying, His tears mixing with the black ointment around His eyes, and as
He rubbed His eyes with His hands, He smeared the ointment all over His face. Mother Yasoda, catching her
beautiful son by the hand, mildly began to chastise Him.
From these dealings between mother Yasoda and Krsna, we can understand the exalted position of a pure devotee
in loving service to the Lord. Yogis, jnanis, karmis and Vedantists cannot even approach Krsna; they must remain
very, very far away from Him and try to enter His bodily effulgence, although this also they are unable to do. Great
demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva always worship the Lord by meditation and by service. Even the most
powerful Yamaraja fears Krsna. Therefore, as we find in the history of Ajamila, Yamaraja instructed his followers
not even to approach the devotees, what to speak of capturing them. In other words, Yamaraja also fears Krsna and
Krsna's devotees. Yet this Krsna became so dependent on mother Yasoda that when she simply showed Krsna the
stick in her hand, Krsna admitted to being an offender and began to cry like an ordinary child. Mother Yasoda, of
course, did not want to chastise her beloved child very much, and therefore she immediately threw her stick away
and simply rebuked Krsna, saying, "Now I shall bind You so that You cannot commit any further offensive
activities. Nor for the time being can You play with Your playmates." This shows the position of a pure devotee, in
contrast with others, like jnanis, yogis and the followers of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, in regarding the
transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth.

Mother Yasoda was always overwhelmed by intense love for Krsna, not knowing who Krsna was or how powerful
He was. Because of maternal affection for Krsna, she never even cared to know who He was. Therefore, when she
saw that her son had become excessively afraid, she threw the stick away and desired to bind Him so that He would
not commit any further naughty activities.
Mother Yasoda wanted to bind Krsna not in order to chastise Him but because she thought that the child was so
restless that He might leave the house in fear. That would be another disturbance. Therefore, because of full
affection, to stop Krsna from leaving the house, she wanted to bind Him with rope. Mother Yasoda wanted to
impress upon Krsna that since He was afraid merely to see her stick, He should not perform such disturbing
activities as breaking the container of yogurt and butter and distributing its contents to the monkeys. Mother
Yasoda did not care to understand who Krsna was and how His power spreads everywhere. This is an example of
pure love for Krsna.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning and no end, no exterior and no interior, no front and no
rear. In other words, He is all-pervading. Because He is not under the influence of the element of time, for Him
there is no difference between past, present and future; He exists in His own transcendental form at all times. Being
absolute, beyond relativity, He is free from distinctions between cause and effect, although He is the cause and
effect of everything. That unmanifested person, who is beyond the perception of the senses, had now appeared as a
human child, and mother Yasoda, considering Him her own ordinary child, bound Him to the wooden mortar with
a rope.
In Bhagavad-gita (10.12), Krsna is described as the Supreme Brahman (param brahma param dhama). The word
brahma means "the greatest." Krsna is greater than the greatest, being unlimited and all-pervading. How can it be
possible for the all-pervading to be measured or bound? Then again, Krsna is the time factor. Therefore, He is allpervading
not only in space but also in time. We have measurements of time, but although we are limited by past,
present and future, for Krsna these do not exist. Every individual person can be measured, but Krsna has already
shown that although He also is an individual, the entire cosmic manifestation is within His mouth. All these points
considered, Krsna cannot be measured. How then did Yasoda want to measure Him and bind Him? We must
conclude that this took place simply on the platform of pure transcendental love. This was the only cause.

(Brahma-samhita 5.33)
Everything is one because Krsna is the supreme cause of everything. Krsna cannot be measured or calculated by
Vedic knowledge (vedesu durlabham). He is available only to devotees (adurlabham atma-bhaktau). Devotees can
handle Him because they act on the basis of loving service (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah).
Thus mother Yasoda wanted to bind Him.

When mother Yasoda was trying to bind the offending child, she saw that the binding rope was short by a
distance the width of two fingers. Thus she brought another rope to join to it.
Here is the first chapter in Krsna's exhibition of unlimited potency to mother Yasoda when she tried to bind Him:
the rope was too short. The Lord had already shown His unlimited potency by killing Putana, Sakatasura and
Trnavarta. Now Krsna exhibited another vibhuti, or display of potency, to mother Yasoda. "Unless I agree," Krsna
desired to show, "you cannot bind Me." Thus although mother Yasoda, in her attempt to bind Krsna, added one
rope after another, ultimately she was a failure. When Krsna agreed, however, she was successful. In other words,
one must be in transcendental love with Krsna, but that does not mean that one can control Krsna. When Krsna is
satisfied with one's devotional service, He does everything Himself. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty
adah. He reveals more and more to the devotee as the devotee advances in service. Jihvadau: this service begins
with the tongue, with chanting and with taking the prasada of Krsna.

Thus mother Yasoda joined whatever ropes were available in the household, but still she failed in her attempt to
bind Krsna. Mother Yasoda's friends, the elderly gopis in the neighborhood, were smiling and enjoying the fun.
Similarly, mother Yasoda, although laboring in that way, was also smiling. All of them were struck with wonder.
Actually this incident was wonderful because Krsna was only a child with small hands. To bind Him should have
required only a rope not more than two feet long. All the ropes in the house combined together might have been
hundreds of feet long, but still He was impossible to bind, for all the ropes together were still too short. Naturally
mother Yasoda and her gopi friends thought, "How is this possible?" Seeing this funny affair, all of them were
smiling. The first rope was short by a measurement the width of two fingers, and after the second rope was added,
it was still two fingers too short. If the shortness of all the ropes were added together, it must have amounted to the
width of hundreds of fingers. Certainly this was astonishing. This was another exhibition of Krsna's inconceivable
potency to His mother and His mother's friends.

Because of mother Yasoda's hard labor, her whole body became covered with perspiration, and the flowers and
comb were falling from her hair. When child Krsna saw His mother thus fatigued, He became merciful to her and
agreed to be bound.
When mother Yasoda and the other ladies finally saw that Krsna, although decorated with many bangles and
other jeweled ornaments, could not be bound with all the ropes available in the house, they decided that Krsna was
so fortunate that He could not be bound by any material condition. Thus they gave up the idea of binding Him. But
in competition between Krsna and His devotee, Krsna sometimes agrees to be defeated. Thus Krsna's internal
energy, yogamaya, was brought to work, and Krsna agreed to be bound by mother Yasoda.

devotee; sva-vasena--who is within the control only of His own self; api--indeed; krsnena--by Krsna; yasya--of

under the control.
O Maharaja Pariksit, this entire universe, with its great, exalted demigods like Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and Lord
Indra, is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet the Supreme Lord has one transcendental
attribute: He comes under the control of His devotees. This was now exhibited by Krsna in this pastime.
This pastime of Krsna's is very difficult to understand, but devotees can understand it. It is therefore said,
darsayams tad-vidam loka atmano bhakta-vasyatam (Bhag. 10.11.9): the Lord displays the transcendental attribute
of coming under the control of His devotees. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.35):
eko 'py asau racayitum jagad-anda-kotim
yac-chaktir asti jagad-anda-caya yad-antah
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
By His one plenary portion as Paramatma, the Lord controls innumerable universes, with all their demigods; yet
He agrees to be controlled by a devotee. In the Upanisads it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can
run with more speed than the mind, but here we see that although Krsna wanted to avoid being arrested by His
mother, He was finally defeated, and mother Yasoda captured Him. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam:
Krsna is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. Nonetheless, He steals butter like one who is
poverty-stricken. Yamaraja, the controller of all living entities, fears the order of Krsna, yet Krsna is afraid of His
mother's stick. These contradictions cannot be understood by one who is not a devotee, but a devotee can
understand how powerful is unalloyed devotional service to Krsna; it is so powerful that Krsna can be controlled by
an unalloyed devotee. This bhrtya-vasyata does not mean that He is under the control of the servant; rather, He is
under the control of the servant's pure love. In Bhagavad-gita (1.21) it is said that Krsna became the chariot driver
of Arjuna. Arjuna ordered Him, senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me 'cyuta: "My dear Krsna, You have
agreed to be my charioteer and to execute my orders. Place my chariot between the two armies of soldiers." Krsna
immediately executed this order, and therefore one may argue that Krsna also is not independent. But this is one's
ajnana, ignorance. Krsna is always fully independent; when He becomes subordinate to His devotees, this is a
display of ananda-cinmaya-rasa, the humor of transcendental qualities that increases His transcendental pleasure.
Everyone worships Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore He sometimes desires to be
controlled by someone else. Such a controller can be no one else but a pure devotee.

na--not; imam--this exalted position; virincah--Lord Brahma; na--nor; bhavah--Lord Siva; na--nor; srih--the
goddess of fortune; api--indeed; anga-samsraya--although she is always the better half of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead; prasadam--mercy; lebhire--obtained; gopi--mother Yasoda; yat tat--as that which; prapa--obtained;
vimukti-dat--from Krsna, who gives deliverance from this material world.
Neither Lord Brahma, nor Lord Siva, nor even the goddess of fortune, who is always the better half of the
Supreme Lord, can obtain from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer from this material world, such
mercy as received by mother Yasoda.
This is a comparative study between mother Yasoda and other devotees of the Lord. As stated in Caitanya
caritamrta (Adi 5.142), ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: the only supreme master is Krsna, and all others are His
servants. Krsna has the transcendental quality of bhrtya-vasyata, becoming subordinate to His bhrtya, or servant.
Now, although everyone is bhrtya and although Krsna has the quality of becoming subordinate to His bhrtya, the
position of mother Yasoda is the greatest. Lord Brahma is bhrtya, a servant of Krsna, and he is adi-kavi, the original
creator of this universe (tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye). Nonetheless, even he could not obtain such mercy as
mother Yasoda. As for Lord Siva, he is the topmost Vaisnava (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh). What to speak of Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is the Lord's constant companion in service, since she
always associates with His body. But even she could not get such mercy. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was surprised,
thinking, "What did mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja do in their previous lives by which they got such a great
opportunity, the opportunity to be the affectionate father and mother of Krsna?"
In this verse there are three negative pronouncements--na, na, na. When anything is uttered three times--"do it,
do it, do it"--one should understand that this is meant to indicate great stress on a fact. In this verse, we find na
lebhire, na lebhire, na lebhire. Yet mother Yasoda is in the supermost exalted position, and thus Krsna has become
completely subordinate to her.
The word vimuktidat is also significant. There are different types of liberation, such as sayujya, salokya, sarupya,
sarsti and samipya, but vimukti means "special mukti." When after liberation one is situated on the platform of
prema-bhakti, one is said to have achieved vimukti, "special mukti." Therefore the word na is mentioned. That
exalted platform of prema is described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as prema pum-artho mahan, and mother
Yasoda naturally acts in such an exalted position in loving affairs. She is therefore a nitya-siddha devotee, an
expansion of Krsna's hladini potency, His potency to enjoy transcendental bliss through expansions who are
special devotees (ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Such devotees are not sadhana-siddha.

Krsna, the son of mother Yasoda (Krsna as the son of Vasudeva is called Vasudeva, and as the son of mother

atma-bhutanam--of self-sufficient yogis; yatha--as; bhakti-matam--of the devotees; iha--in this world.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the son of mother Yasoda, is accessible to devotees engaged in
spontaneous loving service, but He is not as easily accessible to mental speculators, to those striving for selfrealization
by severe austerities and penances, or to those who consider the body the same as the self.
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yasoda, is very easily available to devotees, but
not to tapasvis, yogis, jnanis and others who have a bodily concept of life. Although they may sometimes be called
santa-bhaktas, real bhakti begins with dasya-rasa. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.11):
ye yatha mam prapadyante
tams tathaiva bhajamy aham
mama vartmanuvartante
manusyah partha sarvasah
"As living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son
of Prtha." Everyone is seeking Krsna, for He is the Supersoul of all individual souls. Everyone loves his body and
wants to protect it because he is within the body as the soul, and everyone loves the soul because the soul is part
and parcel of the Supersoul. Therefore, everyone is actually seeking to achieve happiness by reviving his
relationship with the Supersoul. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: "By
all the Vedas, it is I who am to be known." Therefore, the karmis, jnanis, yogis and saintly persons are all seeking
Krsna. But by following in the footsteps of devotees who are in a direct relationship with Krsna, especially the
inhabitants of Vrndavana, one can reach the supreme position of associating with Krsna. As it is said, vrndavanam
parityajya padam ekam na gacchati: Krsna does not leave Vrndavana even for a moment. The vrndavana-vasis--
mother Yasoda, Krsna's friends and Krsna's conjugal lovers, the younger gopis with whom He dances--have very
intimate relationships with Krsna, and if one follows in the footsteps of these devotees, Krsna is available. Although
the nitya-siddha expansions of Krsna always remain with Krsna, if those engaged in sadhana-siddhi follow in the
footsteps of Krsna's nitya-siddha associates, such sadhana-siddhas also can easily attain Krsna without difficulty.
But there are those who are attached to bodily concepts of life. Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, for example, have very
prestigious positions, and thus they have the sense of being very exalted isvaras. In other words, because Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva are guna-avataras and have exalted positions, they have some small sense of being like
Krsna. But the pure devotees who inhabit Vrndavana do not possess any bodily conception. They are fully
dedicated to the service of the Lord in sublime affection, prema. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore
recommended, prema pum-artho mahan: the highest perfection of life is prema, pure love in relationship with
Krsna. And mother Yasoda appears to be the topmost of devotees who have attained this perfection.

In their former birth, these two sons, known as Nalakuvara and Manigriva, were extremely opulent and
fortunate. But because of pride and false prestige, they did not care about anyone, and thus Narada Muni cursed
them to become trees.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"Mother Yasoda Binds Lord Krsna."
Chapter Ten
Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees
This chapter describes how Krsna broke the twin arjuna trees, from which Nalakuvara and Manigriva, the sons of
Kuvera, then came out.
Nalakuvara and Manigriva were great devotees of Lord Siva, but because of material opulence they became so
extravagant and senseless that one day they were enjoying with naked girls in a lake and shamelessly walking here
and there. Suddenly Narada Muni passed by, but they were so maddened by their wealth and false prestige that
even though they saw Narada Muni present, they remained naked and were not even ashamed. In other words,
because of opulence and false prestige, they lost their sense of common decency. Of course, it is the nature of the
material qualities that when one becomes very much opulent in terms of wealth and a prestigious position, one
loses one's sense of etiquette and does not care about anyone, even a sage like Narada Muni. For such bewildered
persons (ahankara-vimudhatma), who especially deride devotees, the proper punishment is to be again stricken
with poverty. The Vedic rules and regulations prescribe how to control the false sense of prestige by the practice of
yama, niyama and so on (tapasa brahmacaryena samena ca damena ca). A poor man can be convinced very easily
that the prestige of an opulent position in this material world is temporary, but a rich man cannot. Therefore
Narada Muni set an example by cursing these two persons, Nalakuvara and Manigriva, to become dull and
unconscious like trees. This was a fit punishment. But because Krsna is always merciful, even though they were
punished they were fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Therefore the
punishment given by Vaisnavas is not at all punishment; rather, it is another kind of mercy. By the curse of the
devarsi, Nalakuvara and Manigriva became twin arjuna trees and remained in the courtyard of mother Yasoda and
Nanda Maharaja, waiting for the opportunity to see Krsna directly. Lord Krsna, by the desire of His devotee,
uprooted these yamala-arjuna trees, and when Nalakuvara and Manigriva were thus delivered by Krsna after one
hundred years of the devas, their old consciousness revived, and they offered Krsna prayers suitable to be offered
by demigods. Having thus gotten the opportunity to see Krsna face to face, they understood how merciful Narada
Muni was, and therefore they expressed their indebtedness to him and thanked him. Then, after circumambulating
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, they departed for their respective abodes.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King Pariksit, because the two sons of Kuvera had been elevated to the association of
Lord Siva, of which they were very much proud, they were allowed to wander in a garden attached to Kailasa Hill,
on the bank of the Mandakini River. Taking advantage of this, they used to drink a kind of liquor called Varuni.
Accompanied by women singing after them, they would wander in that garden of flowers, their eyes always rolling
in intoxication.
This verse mentions some of the material advantages afforded to persons associated with or devoted to Lord Siva.
Apart from Lord Siva, if one is a devotee of any other demigod, one receives some material advantages. Foolish
people, therefore, become devotees of demigods. This has been pointed out and criticized by Lord Krsna in
Bhagavad-gita (7.20): kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah. Those who are not devotees of Krsna
have a taste for women, wine and so forth, and therefore they have been described as hrta jnana, bereft of sense.
The Krsna consciousness movement can very easily point out such foolish persons, for they have been indicated in
Bhagavad-gita (7.15), where Lord Krsna says:
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and
who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." Anyone who is not a devotee of Krsna
and does not surrender to Krsna must be considered naradhama, the lowest of men, and duskrti, one who always
commits sinful activities. Thus there is no difficulty in finding out who is a third-class or fourth-class man, for
one's position can be understood simply by this crucial test: is he or is he not a devotee of Krsna?
Why are devotees of the demigods greater in number than the Vaisnavas? The answer is given herein. Vaisnavas
are not interested in such fourth-class pleasures as wine and women, nor does Krsna allow them such facilities.

People generally go to the Ganges to be purified of the effects of sinful life, but here is an example of how foolish
persons enter the Ganges to become involved in sinful life. It is not that everyone becomes purified by entering the
Ganges. Everything, spiritual and material, depends on one's mental condition.

receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service." (Cc. Madhya 19.151) Narada appeared in the garden to give
the two sons of Kuvera the seed of devotional service, even though they were intoxicated. Saintly persons know
how to bestow mercy upon the fallen souls.

Seeing the two sons of the demigods naked and intoxicated by opulence and false prestige, Devarsi Narada, in
order to show them special mercy, desired to give them a special curse. Thus he spoke as follows.
Although in the beginning Narada Muni appeared very angry and cursed them, at the end the two demigods
Nalakuvara and Manigriva were able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, face to face. Thus the curse
was ultimately auspicious and brilliant. One has to judge what kind of curse Narada placed upon them. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives herein a good example. When a father finds his child deeply asleep but the
child has to take some medicine to cure some disease, the father pinches the child so that the child will get up and
take the medicine. In a similar way, Narada Muni cursed Nalakuvara and Manigriva in order to cure their disease of
material blindness.

sri-naradah uvaca--Narada Muni said; na--there is not; hi--indeed; anyah--another material enjoyment; jusatah--
of one who is enjoying; josyan--things very attractive in the material world (different varieties of eating, sleeping,
mating and defense); buddhi-bhramsah--such enjoyments attract the intelligence; rajah-gunah--being controlled by
the mode of passion; sri-madat--than riches; abhijatya-adih--among the four material principles (attractive personal
bodily features, birth in an aristocratic family, being very learned, and being very rich); yatra--wherein; stri--
women; dyutam--gambling; asavah--wine (wine, women and gambling are very prominent).
Narada Muni said: Among all the attractions of material enjoyment, the attraction of riches bewilders one's
intelligence more than having beautiful bodily features, taking birth in an aristocratic family, and being learned.
When one is uneducated but falsely puffed up by wealth, the result is that one engages his wealth in enjoying wine,
women and gambling.
Among the three modes of material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--people are certainly conducted by
the lower qualities, namely passion and ignorance, and especially by passion. Conducted by the mode of passion,
one becomes more and more involved in material existence. Therefore human life is meant for subduing the modes
of passion and ignorance and advancing in the mode of goodness.
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitam sattve prasidati
(Bhag. 1.2.19)
This is culture: one must subdue the modes of passion and ignorance. In the mode of passion, when one is falsely
proud of wealth, one engages his wealth only for three things, namely wine, women and gambling. We can actually
see, especially in this age, that those who have unnecessary riches simply try to enjoy these three things. In
Western civilization, these three things are very prominent because of an unnecessary increase of wealth. Narada
Muni considered all this in the case of Manigriva and Nalakuvara because he found in them so much pride in the
wealth of their father, Kuvera.

Unable to control their senses, rascals who are falsely proud of their riches or their birth in aristocratic families

When the modes of passion and ignorance increase in human society, giving rise to unnecessary economic

maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however
one may try to maintain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease, such foolish rascals
engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being duskrtis, they completely forget the existence of the supreme
controller, who is sitting within the core of everyone's heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). That
supreme controller is observing every bit of one's activity, and He rewards or punishes everyone by giving one a
suitable body made by material nature (bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya). In this way, sinful
persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that
when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth
will be finished with his next birth.
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
(Bhag. 5.5.4)
Animal killing is prohibited. Every living being, of course, has to eat something (jivo jivasya jivanam). But one
should be taught what kind of food one should take. Therefore the Isopanisad instructs, tena tyaktena bhunjithah:
one should eat whatever is allotted for human beings. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." A devotee, therefore, does
not eat anything that would require slaughterhouses for poor animals. Rather, devotees take prasada of Krsna (tena
tyaktena bhunjithah). Krsna recommends that one give Him patram puspam phalam toyam--a leaf, a Mower, fruit
or water. Animal food is never recommended for human beings; instead, a human being is recommended to take
prasada, remnants of food left by Krsna. Yajna-sistasinah santo mucyante sarva-kilbisaih (Bg. 3.13). If one practices
eating prasada, even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one becomes free from the results of sinful acts.

deva-samjnitam--the body now known as a very exalted person, like president, minister or even demigod; api--
even if the body is so exalted; ante--after death; krmi--turns into worms; vit--or into stool; bhasma-samjnitam--or
into ashes; bhuta-dhruk--a person who does not accept the sastric injunctions and is unnecessarily envious of other
living entities; tat-krte--by acting in that way; sva-artham--self-interest; kim--who is there; veda--who knows;
nirayah yatah--because from such sinful activities one must suffer hellish conditions.
While living one may be proud of one's body, thinking oneself a very big man, minister, president or even
demigod, but whatever one may be, after death this body will turn either into worms, into stool or into ashes. If
one kills poor animals to satisfy the temporary whims of this body, one does not know that he will suffer in his
next birth, for such a sinful miscreant must go to hell and suffer the results of his actions.
In this verse the three words krmi-vid-bhasma are significant. After death, the body may become krmi, which
means "worms," for if the body is disposed of without cremation, it may be eaten by worms; or else it may be eaten
by animals like hogs and vultures and be turned into stool. Those who are more civilized burn the dead body, and
thus it becomes ashes (bhasma-samjnitam). Yet although the body will be turned into worms, stool or ashes,
foolish persons, just to maintain it, commit many sinful activities. This is certainly regrettable. The human form of
body is actually meant for jivasya tattva jijnasa, enlightenment in knowledge of spiritual values. Therefore, one
must seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master. Tasmad gurum prapadyeta: one must approach a guru. Who is a
guru? Sabde pare ca nisnatam (Bhag. 11.3.21): a guru is one who has full transcendental knowledge. Unless one
approaches a spiritual master, one remains in ignorance. Acaryavan puruso veda (Chandogya Upanisad 6.14.2):
one has full knowledge about life when one is acaryavan, controlled by the acarya. But when one is conducted by
rajo-guna and tamo-guna, one does not care about anything; instead, one acts like an ordinary foolish animal,
risking his life (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani) and therefore continuing to go through suffering after suffering. Na te
viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum (Bhag. 7.5.31). Such a foolish person does not know how to elevate himself in this
body. Instead, he indulges in sinful activities and goes deeper and deeper into hellish life.

property as his own and while maintaining it commits such sinful activities as killing animals just to satisfy his
whims? Unless one is a rascal, one cannot commit such sinful activities.
Atheists do not believe in the existence of the soul. Nonetheless, unless one is very cruel, why should one kill
animals unnecessarily? The body is a manifestation of a combination of matter. In the beginning it was nothing,
but by a combination of matter it has come into existence. Then again, when the combination is dismantled, the
body will no longer exist. In the beginning it was nothing, and in the end it will be nothing. Why then should one
commit sinful activities when it is manifested? It is not possible for anyone to do this unless he is rascal number

asatah--of such a foolish rascal; sri-mada-andhasya--who is blinded by temporarily possessing riches and
opulence; daridryam--poverty; param anjanam--the best ointment for the eyes, by which to see things as they are;
atma-aupamyena--with comparison to himself; bhutani--living beings; daridrah--a poverty-stricken man; param--
perfectly; iksate--can see things as they are.
Atheistic fools and rascals who are very much proud of wealth fail to see things as they are. Therefore, returning
them to poverty is the proper ointment for their eyes so they may see things as they are. At least a poverty-stricken
man can realize how painful poverty is, and therefore he will not want others to be in a painful condition like his
own.
Even today, if a man who was formerly poverty-stricken gets money, he is inclined to utilize his money to
perform many philanthropic activities, like opening schools for uneducated men and hospitals for the diseased. In
this connection there is an instructive story called punar musiko bhava, "Again Become a Mouse." A mouse was
very much harassed by a cat, and therefore the mouse approached a saintly person to request to become a cat.
When the mouse became a cat, he was harassed by a dog, and then when he became a dog, he was harassed by a
tiger. But when he became a tiger, he stared at the saintly person, and when the saintly person asked him, "What
do you want?" the tiger said, "I want to eat you." Then the saintly person cursed him, saying, "May you again
become a mouse." A similar thing is going on all over the universe. One is going up and down, sometimes
becoming a mouse, sometimes a tiger, and so on. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
(Cc. Madhya 19.151)
The living entities are promoted and degraded by the laws of nature, but if one is very, very fortunate, by
association with saintly persons he gets the seed of devotional service, and his life becomes successful. Narada
Muni wanted to bring Nalakuvara and Manigriva to the platform of devotional service through poverty, and thus
he cursed them. Such is the mercy of a Vaisnava. Unless one is brought to the Vaisnava platform, one cannot be a
good man. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah (Bhag. 5.18.12). An avaisnava never becomes a good man,
however severely he is punished.

There is a saying, "The happiness of wealth is enjoyable by a person who has tasted the distress of poverty."
There is also another common saying, vandhya ki bujhibe prasava-vedana: "A woman who has not given birth to a
child cannot understand the pain of childbirth." Unless one comes to the platform of actual experience, one cannot
realize what is pain and what is happiness in this material world. The laws of nature act accordingly. If one has
killed an animal, one must himself be killed by that same animal. This is called mamsa. Mam means "me," and sa
means "he." As I am eating an animal, that animal will have the opportunity to eat me. In every state, therefore, it is
ordinarily the custom that if a person commits murder he is hanged.

A poverty-stricken man must automatically undergo austerities and penances because he does not have the
wealth to possess anything. Thus his false prestige is vanquished. Always in need of food, shelter and clothing, he
must be satisfied with what is obtained by the mercy of providence. Undergoing such compulsory austerities is
good for him because this purifies him and completely frees him from false ego.
A saintly person voluntarily accepts a state of poverty just to become free from material false prestige. Many great
kings left their princely standard of living and went to the forest to practice austerity according to Vedic culture,
just to become purified. But if one who cannot voluntarily accept such austerity is put into a situation of poverty,
he automatically must practice austerity. Austerity is good for everyone because it frees one from material
conditions. Therefore, if one is very much proud of his material position, putting him into poverty is the best way
to rectify his foolishness. Daridrya-doso guna-rasi-nasi: when a person is poverty-stricken, naturally his false pride
in aristocracy, wealth, education and beauty is smashed. Thus corrected, he is in the right position for liberation.

The real business of human life is to keep oneself fit for advancement in spiritual realization. Human life is not
meant for making the senses unnecessarily strong so that one suffers from disease and one increases in an envious,
fighting spirit. In this age of Kali, however, human civilization is so misled that people are unnecessarily increasing
in economic development, and as a result they are opening more and more slaughterhouses, liquor shops and
brothels. In this way, the whole civilization is being spoiled.

Saintly persons may freely associate with those who are poverty-stricken, but not with those who are rich. A
poverty-stricken man, by association with saintly persons, very soon becomes uninterested in material desires, and
the dirty things within the core of his heart are cleansed away.
It is said, mahad-vicalanam nrnam grhinam dina-cetasam (Bhag. 10.8.4). The only business of a saintly person or
sannyasi, a person in the renounced order, is to preach Krsna consciousness. Sadhus, saintly persons, want to
preach to both the poor and the rich, but the poor take more advantage of the sadhus' preaching than the rich do.
A poor man receives sadhus very quickly, offers them obeisances, and tries to take advantage of their presence,
whereas a rich man keeps a big greyhound dog at his door so that no one can enter his house. He posts a sign
saying "Beware of Dog" and avoids the association of saintly persons, whereas a poor man keeps his door open for
them and thus benefits by their association more than a rich man does. Because Narada Muni, in his previous life,
was the poverty-stricken son of a maidservant, he got the association of saintly persons and later became the
exalted Narada Muni. This was his actual experience. Therefore, he is now comparing the position of a poor man
with that of a rich man.

automatically purified. Ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam (Siksastaka 1). Unless the core of

A sadhu is one who is engaged in devotional service to the Lord without deviation (bhajate mam ananya-bhak).

"The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies,
he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime." (Bhag. 3.25.21) A sadhu is
suhrdah sarva-dehinam, the friend of everyone. Why then should the rich, instead of associating with sadhus,
waste their valuable time in association with other rich men who are averse to spiritual life? Both the poor man and
the rich man can take advantage of the Krsna consciousness movement, and here it is advised that everyone do so.
There is no profit in avoiding the association of the members of the Krsna consciousness movement. Narottama
dasa Thakura has said:
sat-sanga chadi' kainu asate vilasa
te-karane lagila ye karma-bandha-phansa
If we give up the association of sadhus, saintly persons engaged in Krsna consciousness, and associate with
persons seeking sense gratification and accumulating wealth for this purpose, our life is spoiled. The word asat
refers to an avaisnava, one who is not a devotee of Krsna, and sat refers to a Vaisnava, Krsna's devotee. One should
always seek the association of Vaisnavas and not spoil one's life by mixing with avaisnavas. In Bhagavad-gita (7.15),
the distinction between Vaisnava and avaisnava is enunciated:
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
Anyone who is not surrendered to Krsna is a most sinful person (duskrti), a rascal (mudha), and the lowest of
men (naradhama). Therefore one should not avoid the association of Vaisnavas, which is now available all over the
world in the form of the Krsna consciousness movement.

When a sadhu chastises or punishes someone, he does not do so for revenge. Maharaja Pariksit had inquired why
Narada Muni was subject to such a spirit of revenge (tamah). But this was not tamah, for Narada Muni, in full

physicians. They know how to protect a person from material disease. Thus they are never in tamo-guna. Sa gunan

Whatever they do, after full consideration, is meant just to lead everyone back home, back to Godhead.

These two young men, Nalakuvara and Manigriva, are by fortune the sons of the great demigod Kuvera, but
because of false prestige and madness after drinking liquor, they are so fallen that they are naked but cannot
understand that they are. Therefore, because they are living like trees (for trees are naked but are not conscious),
these two young men should receive the bodies of trees. This will be proper punishment. Nonetheless, after they
become trees and until they are released, by my mercy they will have remembrance of their past sinful activities.
Moreover, by my special favor, after the expiry of one hundred years by the measurement of the demigods, they
will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, face to face, and thus revive their real position
as devotees.
A tree has no consciousness: when cut, it feels no pain. But Narada Muni wanted the consciousness of
Nalakuvara and Manigriva to continue, so that even after being released from the life of trees, they would not forget
the circumstances under which they had been punished. Therefore, to bestow upon them special favor, Narada
Muni arranged things in such a way that after being released, they would be able to see Krsna in Vrndavana and
thus revive their dormant bhakti.
Each day of the demigods in the upper planetary system equals six months of our measurement. Although the
demigods in the upper planetary system are attached to material enjoyment, they are all devotees, and therefore
they are called demigods. There are two kinds of persons, namely the devas and the asuras. Asuras forget their
relationship with Krsna (asuram bhavam asritah), whereas the devas do not forget.
dvau bhuta-sargau loke 'smin
daiva asura eva ca
visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva
asuras tad-viparyayah
(Padma Purana)
The distinction between a pure devotee and a karma-misra devotee is this: a pure devotee does not desire
anything for material enjoyment, whereas a mixed devotee becomes a devotee to become a first-class enjoyer of this
material world. One who is in direct touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service remains
pure, uncontaminated by material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam).
By karma-misra-bhakti one is elevated to the celestial kingdom, by jnana-misra-bhakti one is able to merge in the
Brahman effulgence, and by yoga-misra-bhakti one is able to realize the omnipotency of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. But pure bhakti does not depend on karma, jnana or yoga, for it simply consists of loving affairs. The
liberation of the bhakta, therefore, which is called not just mukti but vimukti, surpasses the five other kinds of
liberation--sayujya, sarupya, salokya, sarsti and samipya. A pure devotee always engages in pure service
(anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama). Taking birth in the upper planetary system as a demigod is a chance
to become a further purified devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. Narada Muni indirectly gave Manigriva
and Nalakuvara the greatest opportunity by his so-called curse.

trouble. This means that even though they are trees, they are disturbed when skinned for medical science.

two persons (Nalakuvara and Manigriva); dhanada-atmajau--born of a rich father and being nondevotees; tat--the
words of Devarsi; tatha--just so; sadhayisyami--I shall execute (because he wanted Me to come face to face with the
yamala-arjuna, I shall do so); yat gitam--as already stated; tat--that; mahatmana--by Narada Muni.
"Although these two young men are the sons of the very rich Kuvera and I have nothing to do with them, Devarsi
Narada is My very dear and affectionate devotee, and therefore because he wanted Me to come face to face with
them, I must do so for their deliverance."
Nalakuvara and Manigriva actually had nothing to do with devotional service or seeing the Supreme Personality
of Godhead face to face, for this is not an ordinary opportunity. It is not that because one is very rich or learned or
was born in an aristocratic family one will be able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. This is
impossible. But in this case, because Narada Muni desired that Nalakuvara and Manigriva see Vasudeva face to face,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to fulfill the words of His very dear devotee Narada Muni. If one seeks
the favor of a devotee instead of directly asking favors from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is very easily
successful. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore recommended: vaisnava thakura tomara kukkura bhuliya
janaha more, krsna se tomara krsna dite para. One should desire to become like a dog in strictly following a
devotee. Krsna is in the hand of a devotee. Adurlabham atma-bhaktau. Thus without the favor of a devotee, one
cannot directly approach Krsna, what to speak of engaging in His service. Narottama dasa Thakura therefore sings,
chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: unless one becomes a servant of a pure devotee, one cannot be
delivered from the material condition of life. In our Gaudiya Vaisnava society, following in the footsteps of Rupa
Gosvami, our first business is to seek shelter of a bona fide spiritual master (adau gurv-asrayah).

Narada Muni was all Your plan. Therefore You are the supreme mystic. Everything--past, present and future--is

As it is said:
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.234)
Krsna's name, attributes and form are Absolute Truth, existing before the creation. Therefore, how can those who
are created--that is, those entrapped in bodies created of material elements--understand Krsna perfectly? This is not
possible. But, sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: Krsna reveals Himself to those engaged in
devotional service. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.15) by the Lord Himself: bhaktya mam abhijanati.
Even the descriptions of Krsna in Srimad-Bhagavatam are sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men with a
poor fund of knowledge. Therefore, the best course by which to know Him is to engage oneself in pure devotional
activities. The more one advances in devotional activities, the more one can understand Him as He is. If from the
material platform one could understand Krsna, then, since Krsna is everything (sarvam khalv idam brahma), one
could understand Krsna by seeing anything within this material world. But that is not possible.

Instead of trying to understand Krsna in detail, it is better to offer our respectful obeisances unto Him, for He is

These bodies of Yours, therefore, are not made of material elements, but are incarnations of Your Supreme
Personality. You are the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, who have now appeared, with full potency, for the
benefit of all living entities within this material world.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.7-8):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
Krsna appears as an incarnation when real spiritual life declines and when rogues and thieves increase to disturb
the situation of the world. Unfortunate, less intelligent persons, bereft of devotional service, cannot understand the
Lord's activities, and therefore such persons describe these activities as kalpana--mythology or imagination--
because they are rascals and the lowest of men (na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah). Such men
cannot understand that the events described by Vyasadeva in the puranas and other sastras are not fictitious or
imaginary, but factual.
Krsna, in His full, unlimited potency, here shows that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for although
the two trees were so large and sturdy that even many elephants could not move them, Krsna, as a child, exhibited
such extraordinary strength that they fell down with a great sound. From the very beginning, by killing Putana,
Sakatasura and Trnavartasura, by causing the trees to fall, and by showing the entire universe within His mouth,
Krsna proved that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The lowest of men (mudhas), because of sinful
activities, cannot understand this, but devotees can accept it without a doubt. Thus the position of a devotee is
different from that of a nondevotee.

The word parama-kalyana is significant because Krsna, in any of His incarnations, appears in order to protect the
sadhus (paritranaya sadhunam). The sadhus, saintly persons or devotees, are always harassed by nondevotees, and
Krsna appears in His incarnations to give them relief. This is His first concern. If we study the history of Krsna's
life, we shall find that for most of His life He predominantly engaged in killing demons one after another.

devotee descending from the parampara system of Narada (svayambhur naradah sambhuh), one can then
understand who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, many pseudo incarnations
are advertised simply for having exhibited some magical performances, but except for persons who are servants of
Narada and other servants of Krsna, no one can understand who is God and who is not. This is confirmed by
Narottama dasa Thakura. Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: no one is delivered from the material
conception of life unless favored by a Vaisnava. Others can never understand, neither by speculation nor by any
other bodily or mental gymnastics.

Everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate (Naradapancaratra).
Everything--the mind, the body and all the sense organs--should be engaged in Krsna's service. This is
to be learned from expert devotees like Narada, Svayambhu and Sambhu. This is the process. We cannot
manufacture our own way of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is not that everything one
manufactures or concocts will lead to understanding God. Such a proposition--yata mata, tata patha--is foolish.
Krsna says, bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: "Only by executing the activities of bhakti can one understand Me." (Bhag.

of Gokula, He was bound to the wooden mortar by the ropes of the gopis, and therefore, smiling widely, He spoke
to the sons of Kuvera the following words.
Krsna was smiling because He was thinking to Himself, "These two young demigods fell from the higher
planetary system to this planet, and I have delivered them from the bondage of standing for a long time as trees,
but as for Me, I am bound by the ropes of the gopis and am subject to their chastisements." In other words, Krsna

devotee in so many ways.

As stated by Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Cc. Madhya 22.54):
'sadhu-sanga,' 'sadhu-sanga'----sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya
If by chance one meets a sadhu, a devotee, one's life is immediately successful, and one is freed from material
bondage. It may be argued that whereas someone may receive a sadhu with great respect, someone else may not
receive a sadhu with such respect. A sadhu, however, is always equipoised toward everyone. Because of being a
pure devotee, a sadhu is always ready to deliver Krsna consciousness without discrimination. As soon as one sees a
sadhu, one naturally becomes free. Nonetheless, persons who are too much offensive, who commit vaisnavaaparadhas,
or offenses to a sadhu, will have to take some time before being rectified. This is also indicated herein.

O Nalakuvara and Manigriva, now you may both return home. Since you desire to be always absorbed in My
devotional service, your desire to develop love and affection for Me will be fulfilled, and now you will never fall
from that platform.
The highest perfection of life is to come to the platform of devotional service and always engage in devotional
activities. Understanding this, Nalakuvara and Manigriva desired to attain that platform, and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead blessed them with the fulfillment of their transcendental desire.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead having spoken to the two demigods in this way,
they circumambulated the Lord, who was bound to the wooden mortar, and offered obeisances to Him. After
taking the permission of Lord Krsna, they returned to their respective homes.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"Deliverance of the Yamala-arjuna Trees."
Chapter Eleven
The Childhood Pastimes of Krsna
This chapter describes how the inhabitants of Gokula left Gokula and went to Vrndavana and how Krsna killed
Vatsasura and Bakasura.
When the yamala-arjuna trees fell, they made a tremendous sound, like that of falling thunderbolts. Being
surprised, Krsna's father, Nanda, and the other elderly inhabitants of Gokula went to the spot, where they saw the
fallen trees and Krsna standing between them, bound to the ulukhala, the wooden mortar. They could find no
cause for the trees' having fallen and Krsna's being there. They thought this might be the work of some other asura
who had met Krsna on this spot, and they inquired from the playmates of Krsna about how the whole incident had
taken place. The children properly described how everything had happened, but the elderly persons could not
believe the story. Some of them, however, thought that it might be true, since they had already seen many
wonderful incidents in connection with Krsna. Anyway, Nanda Maharaja immediately released Krsna from the
ropes.
In this way, Krsna, at every day and every moment, displayed wonderful incidents to increase the parental
affection of Nanda Maharaja and Yasoda, who thus felt both surprise and joy. The breaking of the yamala-arjunas
was one of these wonderful pastimes.
One day a fruit vendor approached Nanda Maharaja's house, and Krsna gathered some food grains with His little
palms and went to the vendor to exchange the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the grains fell from His
palms, only one or two grains remaining, but the fruit vendor, out of full affection, accepted these grains in
exchange for as much fruit as Krsna could take. As soon as she did this, her basket became filled with gold and
jewels.
Thereafter, all the elderly gopas decided to leave Gokula because they saw that in Gokula there was always some
disturbance. They decided to go to Vrndavana, Vraja-dhama, and the next day they all departed. In Vrndavana,
both Krsna and Balarama, after finishing Their childhood pastimes, began to take charge of the calves and send
them to the pasturing grounds (go-carana). During this time, a demon named Vatsasura entered among the calves
and was killed, and another asura, in the shape of a big duck, was also killed. The playmates of Krsna narrated all
these stories to their mothers. The mothers could not believe their children, Krsna's playmates, but because of full
affection they enjoyed these narrations of Krsna's activities.

Considering all the circumstances, had this been done by Krsna? He was standing on the spot, and His playmates
described that this had been done by Him. Had Krsna actually done this, or were these merely stories? This was a

Krsna was bound by the rope to the ulukhala, the mortar, which He was dragging. But how could He have pulled
down the trees? Who had actually done it? Where was the source for this incident? Considering all these
astounding things, the cowherd men were doubtful and bewildered.
The cowherd men were very much agitated because the child Krsna, after all, had been standing between the two
trees, and if by chance the trees had fallen upon Him, He would have been smashed. But He was standing as He
was, and still the things had happened, so who had done all this? How could these events have happened in such a
wonderful way? These considerations were some of the reasons they were agitated and bewildered. They thought,
however, that by chance Krsna had been saved by God so that nothing had happened to Him.

Krsna's playmates wanted to inform Krsna's father of the exact situation by explaining that not only did the trees
break, but out of the broken trees came two beautiful men. "All these things happened," they said. "We have seen

Because of intense paternal affection, the cowherd men, headed by Nanda, could not believe that Krsna could
have uprooted the trees in such a wonderful way. Therefore they could not put their faith in the words of the boys.
Some of the men, however, were in doubt. "Since Krsna was predicted to equal Narayana," they thought, "it might
be that He could have done it."
One view was that it was impossible for a small boy like this to have done such a thing as pulling down the trees.
But there were doubts because Krsna had been predicted to equal Narayana. Therefore the cowherd men were in a
dilemma.

Nanda Maharaja was surprised that Yasoda, Krsna's mother, could have bound her beloved child in such a way.
Krsna was exchanging love with her. How then could she have been so cruel as to bind Him to the wooden mortar?
Nanda Maharaja understood this exchange of love, and therefore he smiled and released Krsna. In other words, as
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, binds a living entity in fruitive activities, He binds mother Yasoda and
Nanda Maharaja in parental affection. This is His pastime.

To pure devotees throughout the world who could understand His activities, the Supreme Personality of

the pleasure of the Vrajavasis by His childhood activities.
That Krsna performed childhood activities to increase the pleasure of His devotees was another transcendental
humor. He exhibited these activities not only to the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi, but also to others, who were
captivated by His external potency and opulence. Both the internal devotees, who were simply absorbed in love of
Krsna, and the external devotees, who were captivated by His unlimited potency, were informed of Krsna's desire
to be submissive to His servants.

Once a woman selling fruit was calling, "O inhabitants of Vrajabhumi, if you want to purchase some fruits, come
here!" Upon hearing this, Krsna immediately took some grains and went to barter as if He needed some fruits.
Aborigines generally go to the villagers to sell fruits. How much the aborigines were attached to Krsna is here
described. Krsna, to show His favor to the aborigines, would immediately go purchase fruits, bartering with paddy
in His hand as He had seen others do.

phala-vikrayini--the aborigine fruit vendor, who was an elderly woman; tasya--of Krsna; cyuta-dhanya--the paddy
He brought to barter having mostly fallen; kara-dvayam--palms of the hands; phalaih apurayat--the fruit vendor
filled His small palms with fruits; ratnaih--in exchange for jewels and gold; phala-bhandam--the basket of fruit;
apuri ca--filled.
While Krsna was going to the fruit vendor very hastily, most of the grains He was holding fell. Nonetheless, the
fruit vendor filled Krsna's hands with fruits, and her fruit basket was immediately filled with jewels and gold.
In Bhagavad-gita (9.26) Krsna says:
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
Krsna is so kind that if anyone offers Him a leaf, a fruit, a flower or some water, He will immediately accept it.
The only condition is that these things should be offered with bhakti (yo me bhaktya prayacchati). Otherwise, if
one is puffed up with false prestige, thinking, "I have so much opulence, and I am giving something to Krsna,"
one's offering will not be accepted by Krsna. The fruit vendor, although a woman belonging to the poor aborigine
class, dealt with Krsna with great affection, saying, "Krsna, You have come to me to take some fruit in exchange for
grains. All the grains have fallen, but still You may take whatever You like." Thus she filled Krsna's palms with
whatever fruits He could carry. In exchange, Krsna filled her whole basket with jewels and gold.
From this incident one should learn that for anything offered to Krsna with love and affection, Krsna can
reciprocate many millions of times over, both materially and spiritually. The basic principle involved is an
exchange of love. Therefore Krsna teaches in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
"O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you
may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me." With love and affection, one should try to give something to
Krsna from one's source of income. Then one's life will be successful. Krsna is full in all opulences; He does not
need anything from anyone. But if one is prepared to give something to Krsna, that is for one's own benefit. The
example given in this connection is that when one's real face is decorated, the reflection of one's face is
automatically decorated. Similarly, if we try to serve Krsna with all our opulences, we, as parts and parcels or
reflections of Krsna, will become happy in exchange. Krsna is always happy, for He is atmarama, fully satisfied with
His own opulence.

Generally young boys are competitive. If one friend has done something, another friend also wants to do
something. Therefore mother Yasoda pointed out how Krsna's playmates were decorated, so that Krsna might be
induced to decorate Himself like them.

My dear Maharaja Pariksit, because of intense love and affection, mother Yasoda, Krsna's mother, considered

Balarama, and brought Them home, where she performed her duties by fully bathing Them, dressing Them and
feeding Them.
Krsna is always neat, clean and opulent and does not need to be washed, bathed or dressed, yet mother Yasoda,

All these incidents are being caused by some unknown demon. Before he comes here to create another
disturbance, it is our duty to go somewhere else with the boys until there are no more disturbances.
Upananda suggested, "By the mercy of Lord Visnu, Krsna has always been saved from so many dangerous
incidents. Now let us leave this place and go someplace where we may worship Lord Visnu undisturbed, before
there is another cause of death from some demon who may attack us." A devotee desires only that he may execute
devotional service undisturbed. Actually we see, however, that even during the presence of Krsna, when Nanda
Maharaja and the other cowherd men had the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their presence, there were
disturbances. Of course, in every case, Krsna came out victorious. The instruction we may derive from this is that
we should not be disturbed by so-called disturbances. There have been so many disturbances to our Krsna
consciousness movement, but we cannot give up our forward march. On the contrary, people are receiving this
movement very enthusiastically all over the world, and they are purchasing literature about Krsna consciousness
with redoubled energy. Thus there are both encouragements and disturbances. This was so even in Krsna's time.

As soon as Krsna and Balarama were a little grown up, They were meant for taking care of the calves. Although
born of a very well-to-do family, They still had to take care of the calves. This was the system of education. Those
who were not born in brahmana families were not meant for academic education. The brahmanas were trained in a
literary, academic education, the ksatriyas were trained to take care of the state, and the vaisyas learned how to
cultivate the land and take care of the cows and calves. There was no need to waste time going to school to be
falsely educated and later increase the numbers of the unemployed. Krsna and Balarama taught us by Their
personal behavior. Krsna took care of the cows and played His flute, and Balarama took care of agricultural
activities with a plow in His hand.

tau--Krsna and Balarama; vatsa-palakau--as if taking care of the calves; bhutva--so becoming; sarva-loka-ekapalakau--
although They are the maintainers of all living beings throughout the whole universe; sa-pratah-asau--
finishing breakfast in the morning; go-vatsan--all the calves; carayantau--tending; viceratuh--wandered here and
there.
After the killing of the demon, Krsna and Balarama finished Their breakfast in the morning, and while continuing
to take care of the calves, They wandered here and there. Krsna and Balarama, the Supreme Personalities of
Godhead, who maintain the entire creation, now took charge of the calves as if cowherd boys.
Paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam. Krsna's daily business here in this material world was to kill the
duskrtis. This did not hamper His daily affairs, for it was routine work. While He tended the calves on the bank of
the River Yamuna, two or three incidents took place every day, and although these were serious, killing the demons
one after another appeared to be His daily routine work.

Although Balarama can do everything, because of intense affection for His brother He was momentarily

Rukmini. When Krsna, after kidnapping Rukmini, was attacked by all the kings, Rukmini was momentarily
bewildered, until the Lord took the proper steps.

Krsna, who was the father of Lord Brahma but who was acting as the son of a cowherd man, became like fire,
burning the root of the demon's throat, and the demon Bakasura immediately disgorged Him. When the demon
saw that Krsna, although having been swallowed, was unharmed, he immediately attacked Krsna again with his
sharp beak.
Although Krsna is always as soft as a lotus, within the throat of Bakasura He created a burning sensation of being
hotter than fire. Although Krsna's whole body is sweeter than sugar candy, Bakasura tasted bitterness and therefore
immediately vomited Krsna up. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.11), ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva
bhajamy aham. When Krsna is accepted as an enemy, He becomes the most intolerable object for the nondevotee,
who cannot tolerate Krsna within or without. Here this is shown by the example of Bakasura.

incident loudly.
It was the practice of the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi to compose poetry about the incidents that occurred in the
forest when Krsna performed His different activities of killing the asuras. They would compose all the stories in
poetry or have this done by professional poets, and then they would sing about these incidents. Thus it is written
here that the boys sang very loudly.

it was these causes of fear that were killed, instead of Him.

Although the causes of death, the daityas, were very fierce, they could not kill this boy Krsna. Rather, because

a fire.
Nanda Maharaja innocently thought, "Perhaps this boy Krsna formerly killed all these demons, and therefore in
this life they are envious and are attacking Him. But Krsna is a fire, and they are flies, and in a fight between fire
and flies, the fire is always victorious." Fighting is always taking place between the demons and the power of the
Supreme Personality. Paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg. 4.8). Anyone who is against the control of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be killed, life after life. Ordinary living beings are subject to karma, but
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always victorious over the demons.

not understand Krsna as He is. Gargamuni was able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the
Vedas, but Nanda Maharaja could not understand Krsna directly. Because of his intense love for Krsna, he forgot
who Krsna was and could not understand Krsna's potency. Although Krsna is Narayana Himself, Gargamuni did
not disclose this. Thus Nanda Maharaja appreciated the words of Gargamuni, but because of his deep affection he

those of Narayana.

Bhagavatam. Sadyo hrdy avarudhyate 'tra krtibhih susrusubhis tat-ksanat (Bhag. 1.1.2). Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda in Vrndavana appeared like ordinary persons of this material world, but they never felt the tribulations of
this world, although they sometimes met many dangerous situations created by the demons. This is a practical
example. If we follow in the footsteps of Nanda Maharaja and the gopas, we can all be happy simply by discussing
the activities of Krsna.

age are very difficult to perform. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore declared, sarvatma-snapanam param

Bhagavatam so that anyone in any part of the world can be absorbed in the Krsna consciousness movement by

like monkeys.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Childhood Pastimes of Krsna."
Chapter Twelve
The Killing of the Demon Aghasura
This chapter describes in detail Krsna's pastime of killing Aghasura.
One day Krsna wanted to enjoy a picnic lunch within the forest, and therefore He went out early into the forest
with the other cowherd boys, accompanied by their respective groups of calves. While they were enjoying their
picnic, Aghasura, the younger brother of Putana and Bakasura, appeared there, desiring to kill Krsna and His
companions. The demon, who had been sent by Kamsa, assumed the form of a python, expanding himself to a
length of eight miles and the height of a mountain, his mouth seeming to extend from the surface of the earth to
the heavenly planets. Having assumed this feature, Aghasura lay on the road. Krsna's friends, the cowherd boys,
thought that the demon's form was one of the beautiful spots of Vrndavana. Thus they wanted to enter within the
mouth of this gigantic python. The gigantic figure of the python became a subject for their sporting pleasure, and
they began to laugh, confident that even if this figure were dangerous, Krsna was there to protect them. In this
way, they proceeded toward the mouth of the gigantic figure.
Krsna knew everything about Aghasura, and therefore He wanted to forbid His friends to enter the demon's
mouth, but in the meantime all the cowherd boys, along with their groups of calves, entered the mouth of that
gigantic figure. Krsna was waiting outside, and Aghasura was waiting for Krsna, thinking that as soon as Krsna
entered he would close his mouth so that everyone would die. While waiting for Krsna, he refrained from
swallowing the boys. In the meantime, Krsna was thinking of how to save the boys and kill Aghasura. Thus He
entered the mouth of the gigantic asura, and when He was within the demon's mouth along with His friends, He
expanded His body to such an extent that the asura suffocated and died. After this, Krsna, by casting His nectarean
glance upon His friends, brought them back to life, and with pleasure they all came out unhurt. Thus Krsna
encouraged all the demigods, and they expressed their pleasure and happiness. For a crooked, sinful person there
is no scope for sayujya-mukti, or becoming one with the effulgence of Krsna, but because the Supreme Personality
of Godhead entered the body of Aghasura, by His touch this demon got the opportunity to merge into the existence
of the Brahman effulgence and thus attain sayujya-mukti.
When this pastime was performed, Krsna was only five years old. One year later, when He was six years old and
He stepped into the pauganda age, this pastime was disclosed to the inhabitants of Vraja. Pariksit Maharaja
inquired, "Why is it that this pastime was disclosed only after one year and yet the inhabitants of Vraja thought
that it had been performed that very day?" With this question, the Twelfth Chapter ends.

Along with the cowherd boys and their own groups of calves, Krsna came out with an unlimited number of
calves assembled. Then all the boys began to sport in the forest in a greatly playful spirit.
In this verse the words krsna-vatsair asankhyataih are significant. The word asankhyata means "unlimited."
Krsna's calves were unlimited. We may speak of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,
millions, billions, trillions, tens of trillions, and so on, but when we go further to speak of numbers impossible for
us to count, we are speaking of unlimited numbers. Such unlimited numbers are indicated here by the word
asankhyataih. Krsna is unlimited, His potency is unlimited, His cows and calves are unlimited, and His space is
unlimited. Therefore He is described in Bhagavad-gita as Parabrahman. The word brahman means "unlimited," and
Krsna is the Supreme Unlimited, Parabrahman. Therefore, we should not consider the statements of this verse to be
mythological. They are factual, but inconceivable. Krsna can accommodate an unlimited number of calves and an
unlimited measurement of space. This is neither mythological nor false, but if we study Krsna's potency with our
limited knowledge, that potency will never be possible to understand. Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam
indriyaih (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.109). Our senses cannot perceive how He could keep an unlimited number
of calves and cows and have unlimited space in which to do so. But this is answered in the Brhad-bhagavatamrta:
evam prabhoh priyanam ca
dhamnas ca samayasya ca
avicintya-prabhavatvad
atra kincin na durghatam
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, in the Brhad-bhagavatamrta, states that since everything about Krsna is unlimited, nothing
is impossible for Him. It is in this sense that we have to understand this verse.

musnanto 'nyonya-sikyadin
jnatan arac ca ciksipuh
tatratyas ca punar durad
dhasantas ca punar daduh
musnantah--stealing; anyonya--from one another; sikya-adin--lunch bags and other belongings; jnatan--having
been understood by the proprietor of the bag; arat ca--to a distant place; ciksipuh--threw away; tatratyah ca--those
who were in that place also; punah durat--then again threw farther away; hasantah ca punah daduh--when they saw
the proprietor, they threw it farther away and enjoyed laughing, and when the owner sometimes cried, his bag was
given to him again.
All the cowherd boys used to steal one another's lunch bags. When a boy came to understand that his bag had
been taken away, the other boys would throw it farther away, to a more distant place, and those standing there
would throw it still farther. When the proprietor of the bag became disappointed, the other boys would laugh, the
proprietor would cry, and then the bag would be returned.
This kind of playing and stealing among boys still exists even in the material world because this kind of sporting
pleasure is present in the spiritual world, from which this idea of enjoyment emanates. Janmady asya yatah
(Vedanta-sutra 1.1.2). This same enjoyment is displayed by Krsna and His associates in the spiritual world, but
there the enjoyment is eternal, whereas here, on the material platform, it is temporary; there the enjoyment is
brahman, whereas here the enjoyment is jada. The Krsna consciousness movement is meant to train one how to
transfer oneself from the jada to the Brahman, because human life is meant for this purpose. Athato brahma jijnasa
(Vedanta-sutra 1.1.1). Krsna comes down to teach us how we can enjoy with Him on the spiritual platform, in the
spiritual world. Not only does He come, but He personally displays His pastimes in Vrndavana and attracts people
to spiritual enjoyment.

Sometimes Krsna would go to a somewhat distant place to see the beauty of the forest. Then all the other boys
would run to accompany Him, each one saying, "I shall be the first to run and touch Krsna! I shall touch Krsna
first!" In this way they enjoyed life by repeatedly touching Krsna.

accumulated the results of life after life of pious activities.
All the boys would be differently engaged. Some boys blew their flutes, and others blew bugles made of horn.
Some imitated the buzzing of the bumblebees, and others imitated the voice of the cuckoo. Some boys imitated
flying birds by running after the birds' shadows on the ground, some imitated the beautiful movements and
attractive postures of the swans, some sat down with the ducks, sitting silently, and others imitated the dancing of
the peacocks. Some boys attracted young monkeys in the trees, some jumped into the trees, imitating the monkeys,
some made faces as the monkeys were accustomed to do, and others jumped from one branch to another. Some
boys went to the waterfalls and crossed over the river, jumping with the frogs, and when they saw their own
reflections on the water they would laugh. They would also condemn the sounds of their own echoes. In this way,
all the cowherd boys used to play with Krsna, who is the source of the Brahman effulgence for jnanis desiring to
merge into that effulgence, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead for devotees who have accepted eternal
servitorship, and who for ordinary persons is but another ordinary child. The cowherd boys, having accumulated
the results of pious activities for many lives, were able to associate in this way with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. How can one explain their great fortune?
As recommended by Srila Rupa Gosvami, tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet (Bhakti-rasamrtasindhu
1.2.4). Somehow or other, whether one thinks of Krsna as an ordinary human child, as the source of the
Brahman effulgence, as the origin of Paramatma, or as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should
concentrate one's full attention upon the lotus feet of Krsna. That is also the instruction of Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the easiest way of directly approaching
Krsna. Isvarah sadyo hrdy avarudhyate 'tra krtibhih susrusubhis tat-ksanat (Bhag. 1.1.2). Diverting even a little of
one's attention toward Krsna and activities in Krsna consciousness immediately enables one to achieve the highest
perfection of life. This is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness movement. Lokasyajanato vidvams cakre satvatasamhitam
(Bhag. 1.7.6). The secret of success is unknown to people in general, and therefore Srila Vyasadeva,
being compassionate toward the poor souls in this material world, especially in this age of Kali, has given us the
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-bhagavatam puranam amalam yad vaisnavanam priyam (Bhag. 12.13.18). For
Vaisnavas who are somewhat advanced, or who are fully aware of the glories and potencies of the Lord, Srimad-
Bhagavatam is a beloved Vedic literature. After all, we have to change this body (tatha dehantara-praptih). If we do
not care about Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, we do not know what the next body will be. But if one
adheres to these two books--Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam--one is sure to obtain the association of Krsna
in the next life (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna). Therefore, distribution of Srimad-Bhagavatam
all over the world is a great welfare activity for theologians, philosophers, transcendentalists and yogis (yoginam
api sarvesam), as well as for people in general. Janma-labhah parah pumsam ante narayana-smrtih (Bhag. 2.1.6): if
we can somehow or other remember Krsna, Narayana, at the end of life, our life will be successful.

Yogis may undergo severe austerities and penances for many births by practicing yama, niyama, asana and
pranayama, none of which are easily performed. Yet in due course of time, when these yogis attain the perfection of
controlling the mind, they will still be unable to taste even a particle of dust from the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. What then can we describe about the great fortune of the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi,
Vrndavana, with whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally lived and who saw the Lord face to face?
We can simply imagine the great fortune of the inhabitants of Vrndavana. It is impossible to describe how, after
many, many births of pious activities, they have become so fortunate.

My dear King Pariksit, thereafter there appeared a great demon named Aghasura, whose death was being awaited
even by the demigods. The demigods drank nectar every day, but still they feared this great demon and awaited his
death. This demon could not tolerate the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed in the forest by the cowherd boys.
One may ask how Krsna's pastimes could be interrupted by a demon. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura
answers this question by saying that although the transcendental pleasure being enjoyed by the cowherd boys
could not be stopped, unless they stopped the transcendental pleasure of their various activities they could not eat
their lunch. Therefore at lunchtime Aghasura appeared by the arrangement of yogamaya, so that for the time being
they could stop their activities and take lunch. Changing varieties are the mother of enjoyment. The cowherd boys
would continuously play, then stop, and then again enjoy in a different way. Therefore every day a demon would
come and interrupt their sporting pastimes. The demon would be killed, and then the boys would engage again in
their transcendental pastimes.

Krsna saw that all the cowherd boys, who did not know anyone but Him as their Lord, had now gone out of His
hand and were helpless, having entered like straws into the fire of the abdomen of Aghasura, who was death
personified. It was intolerable for Krsna to be separated from His friends the cowherd boys. Therefore, as if seeing
that this had been arranged by His internal potency, Krsna was momentarily struck with wonder and unsure of
what to do.

Now, what was to be done? How could both the killing of this demon and the saving of the devotees be
performed simultaneously? Krsna, being unlimitedly potent, decided to wait for an intelligent means by which He
could simultaneously save the boys and kill the demon. Then He entered the mouth of Aghasura.
Krsna is known as ananta-virya-sarvajna because everything is known to Him. Because He knows everything
perfectly well, it was not difficult for Him to find a means by which He could save the boys and at the same time
kill the demon. Thus He also decided to enter the demon's mouth.

Such are the acts of Krsna. paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg. 4.8). By enlarging Himself within

From the body of the gigantic python, a glaring effulgence came out, illuminating all directions, and stayed
individually in the sky until Krsna came out from the corpse's mouth. Then, as all the demigods looked on, this
effulgence entered into Krsna's body.
Apparently the serpent named Aghasura, because of having received association with Krsna, attained mukti by
entering Krsna's body. Entering the body of Krsna is called sayujya-mukti, but later verses prove that Aghasura,
like Dantavakra and others, received sarupya-mukti. This has been broadly described by Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura with references from the Vaisnava-tosani of Srila Jiva Gosvami. Aghasura attained sarupyamukti,
being promoted to the Vaikuntha planets to live with the same four-armed bodily features as Visnu. The
explanation of how this is so may be summarized as follows.
The effulgence came out from the python's body and became purified, attaining spiritual suddha-sattva, freedom
from material contamination, because Krsna had stayed within the serpent's body, even after the serpent's death.
One may doubt that such a demon, full of mischievous activities, could attain the liberation of sarupya or sayujya,
and one may be astonished about this. But Krsna is so kind that in order to drive away such doubts, He had the
effulgence, the individual life of the python, wait for some time in its individuality, in the presence of all the
demigods.
Krsna is the full effulgence, and every living being is part and parcel of that effulgence. As proved here, the
effulgence in every living being is individual. For some time, the effulgence remained outside the demon's body,
individually, and did not mix with the whole effulgence, the brahmajyoti. The Brahman effulgence is not visible to
material eyes, but to prove that every living being is individual, Krsna had this individual effulgence stay outside
the demon's body for some time, for everyone to see. Then Krsna proved that anyone killed by Him attains
liberation, whether sayujya, sarupya, samipya or whatever.
But the liberation of those who are on the transcendental platform of love and affection is vimukti, special
liberation. Thus the serpent first entered the body of Krsna personally and mixed with the Brahman effulgence.
This merging is called sayujya-mukti. But from later verses we find that Aghasura attained sarupya-mukti. Text 38
explains that Aghasura attained a body exactly like that of Visnu, and the verse after that also clearly states that he
attained a completely spiritual body like that of Narayana. Therefore in two or three places the Bhagavatam has
confirmed that Aghasura attained sarupya-mukti. One may then argue, How is it that he mixed with the Brahman
effulgence? The answer is that as Jaya and Vijaya, after three births, again attained sarupya-mukti and association
with the Lord, Aghasura received a similar liberation.

Thereafter, everyone being pleased, the demigods began to shower flowers from Nandana-kanana, the celestial
dancing girls began to dance, and the Gandharvas, who are famous for singing, offered songs of prayer. The
drummers began to beat their kettledrums, and the brahmanas offered Vedic hymns. In this way, both in the
heavens and on earth, everyone began to perform his own duties, glorifying the Lord.
Everyone has some particular duty. The sastra has concluded (nirupitah) that everyone should glorify the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by his own qualifications. If you are a singer, always glorify the Supreme Lord by
singing very nicely. If you are a musician, glorify the Supreme Lord by playing musical instruments. Svanusthitasya
dharmasya samsiddhir hari-tosanam (Bhag. 1.2.13). The perfection of life is to satisfy the Personality of Godhead.
Therefore, beginning from this earth up to the celestial kingdom, everyone engaged in glorifying the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The decision of all great saintly persons is that whatever qualifications one has acquired
should be utilized to glorify the Supreme Lord.
idam hi pumsas tapasah srutasya va

"Learned sages have definitely concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, austerity,
Vedic study, sacrifice, the chanting of hymns, and charity is found in the transcendental descriptions of the
qualities of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry." (Bhag. 1.5.22) This is the perfection of life. One should be
trained how to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one's respective qualities. Education, austerity,
penance or, in the modern world, business, industry, education and so on--all should be engaged in glorifying the
Lord. Then everyone in the world will be happy.
Krsna comes, therefore, to exhibit His transcendental activities so that people may have the chance to glorify Him
in every respect. To understand how to glorify the Lord is actual research work. It is not that everything should be
understood without God. That is condemned.

This incident of Krsna's saving Himself and His associates from death and of giving deliverance to Aghasura, who
had assumed the form of a python, took place when Krsna was five years old. It was disclosed in Vrajabhumi after
one year, as if it had taken place on that very day.
The word moksanam means "liberation." For the associates of Krsna and for Krsna Himself, there is no question
about liberation; they are already liberated, being in the spiritual world. In the material world there are birth,
death, old age and disease, but in the spiritual world there are no such things because everything is eternal. As for
the python, however, by the association of Krsna and His devotees, Aghasura also achieved the same facility of
eternal life. Therefore, as indicated here by the word atmahi-moksanam, if the python Aghasura could receive
eternal association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are already associates
of the Lord? Sakam vijahruh krta-punya-punjah (Bhag. 10.12.11). Here is proof that God is good for everyone.
Even when He kills someone, the one who is killed attains liberation. What then is to be said of those who are

Krsna is the cause of all causes. The causes and effects of the material world, both higher and lower, are all
created by the Supreme Lord, the original controller. When Krsna appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda, He did so by His causeless mercy. Consequently, for Him to exhibit His unlimited opulence was not at all
wonderful. Indeed, He showed such great mercy that even Aghasura, the most sinful miscreant, was elevated to
being one of His associates and achieving sarupya-mukti, which is actually impossible for materially contaminated
persons to attain.
The word maya is also used in connection with love. Out of maya, love, a father has affection for his child.
Therefore the word mayinah indicates that Krsna, out of love, appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaja and assumed
the form of a human child (manujarbha). Krsna is the cause of all causes. He is the creator of cause and effect, and
He is the supreme controller. Nothing is impossible for Him. Therefore, that He enabled even a living being like
Aghasura to attain the salvation of sarupya-mukti was not at all wonderful for Krsna. Krsna took pleasure in
entering the mouth of Aghasura in a sporting spirit along with His associates. Therefore, when Aghasura, by that
sporting association, as maintained in the spiritual world, was purified of all contamination, he attained sarupyamukti
and vimukti by the grace of Krsna. For Krsna this was not at all wonderful.

If even only once or even by force one brings the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead into one's mind,
one can attain the supreme salvation by the mercy of Krsna, as did Aghasura. What then is to be said of those
whose hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead enters when He appears as an incarnation, or those who always
think of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the source of transcendental bliss for all living entities and by whom all
illusion is completely removed?
The process for receiving the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here. Yat-pada-pankajapalasa-
vilasa-bhaktya (Bhag. 4.22.39). Simply by thinking of Krsna, one can attain Him very easily. Krsna is also
described as having His lotus feet always within the hearts of His devotees (bhagavan bhakta-hrdi sthitah). In the
case of Aghasura, one may argue that he was not a devotee. The answer to this is that he thought of Krsna for a
moment with devotion. Bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah. Without devotion, one cannot think of Krsna; and, conversely,
whenever one thinks of Krsna, one undoubtedly has devotion. Although Aghasura's purpose was to kill Krsna, for a
moment Aghasura thought of Krsna with devotion, and Krsna and His associates wanted to sport within Aghasura's
mouth. Similarly, Putana wanted to kill Krsna by poisoning Him, but Krsna took her as His mother because He had
accepted the milk of her breast. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat (Bg. 2.40). Especially when
Krsna appears as an avatara, anyone who thinks of Krsna in His different incarnations (ramadi-murtisu kalaniyamena
tisthan), and especially in His original form as Krsna, attains salvation. There are many instances of this,
and among them is Aghasura, who attained the salvation of sarupya-mukti. Therefore the process is satatam
kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah (Bg. 9.14). Those who are devotees always engage in glorifying Krsna.
Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam: when we speak of Krsna, we refer to all His avataras, such as Krsna,
Govinda, Narayana, Visnu, Lord Caitanya, Krsna-Balarama and Syamasundara. One who always thinks of Krsna
must attain vimukti, special salvation as the Lord's personal associate, not necessarily in Vrndavana, but at least in
Vaikuntha. This is called sarupya-mukti.

O greatest yogi, my spiritual master, kindly describe why this happened. I am very much curious to know about
it. I think that it was nothing but another illusion due to Krsna.
Krsna has many potencies: parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8). The description of
Aghasura was disclosed after one year. Some act of Krsna's potency must have been involved. Therefore Maharaja
Pariksit was very curious to know about this, and he requested Sukadeva Gosvami to explain it.

O my lord, my spiritual master, although we are the lowest of ksatriyas, we are glorified and benefited because we
have the opportunity of always hearing from you the nectar of the pious activities of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
The pious activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are very confidential. It is not ordinarily possible to
hear such activities unless one is very, very fortunate. Pariksit Maharaja placed himself as ksatra-bandhavah, which
means "the lowest of the ksatriyas." The qualities of the ksatriya are described in Bhagavad-gita, and although the
general quality of the ksatriya is isvara-bhava, the tendency to rule, a ksatriya is not supposed to rule over a
brahmana. Thus Maharaja Pariksit regretted that he had wanted to rule over the brahmanas and had therefore been
cursed. He considered himself the lowest of the ksatriyas. Danam isvara-bhavas ca ksatram karma svabhavajam (Bg.
18.43). There was no doubt that Maharaja Pariksit had the good qualities of a ksatriya, but as a devotee he
presented himself, with submissiveness and humility, as the lowest of the ksatriyas, remembering his act of
wrapping a dead serpent around the neck of a brahmana. A student and disciple has the right to ask the guru about
any confidential service, and it is the duty of the guru to explain these confidential matters to his disciple.

Gosvami in this way, Sukadeva Gosvami, immediately remembering subject matters about Krsna within the core of
his heart, externally lost contact with the actions of his senses. Thereafter, with great difficulty, he revived his
external sensory perception and began to speak to Maharaja Pariksit about krsna-katha.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Tenth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled,
"The Killing of the Demon Aghasura."
Chapter Thirteen
The Stealing of the Boys and Calves by Brahma
This chapter describes Lord Brahma's attempt to take away the calves and cowherd boys, and it also describes the
bewilderment of Lord Brahma and finally the clearance of his illusion.
Although the incident concerning Aghasura had been performed one year before, when the cowherd boys were
five years old, when they were six years old they said, "It happened today." What happened was this. After killing
Aghasura, Krsna, along with His associates the cowherd boys, went for a picnic within the forest. The calves, being
allured by green grasses, gradually went far away, and therefore Krsna's associates became a little agitated and
wanted to bring back the calves. Krsna, however, encouraged the boys by saying, "You take your tiffin without
being agitated. I shall go find the calves." And thus the Lord departed. Then, just to examine the potency of Krsna,
Lord Brahma took away all the calves and cowherd boys and kept them in a secluded place.
When Krsna was unable to find the calves and boys, He could understand that this was a trick performed by
Brahma. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, in order to please Lord Brahma, as well
as His own associates and their mothers, expanded Himself to become the calves and boys, exactly as they were
before. In this way, He discovered another pastime. A special feature of this pastime was that the mothers of the
cowherd boys thus became more attached to their respective sons, and the cows became more attached to their
calves. After nearly a year, Baladeva observed that all the cowherd boys and calves were expansions of Krsna. Thus
He inquired from Krsna and was informed of what had happened.
When one full year had passed, Brahma returned and saw that Krsna was still engaged as usual with His friends
and the calves and cows. Then Krsna exhibited all the calves and cowherd boys as four-armed forms of Narayana.
Brahma could then understand Krsna's potency, and he was astonished by the pastimes of Krsna, his worshipable
Lord. Krsna, however, bestowed His causeless mercy upon Brahma and released him from illusion. Thus Brahma
began to offer prayers to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said: O best of devotees, most fortunate Pariksit, you have inquired very nicely, for
although constantly hearing the pastimes of the Lord, you are perceiving His activities to be newer and newer.
Unless one is very advanced in Krsna consciousness, one cannot stick to hearing the pastimes of the Lord
constantly. Nityam nava-navaya-manam: even though advanced devotees hear continually about the Lord for years,
they still feel that these topics are coming to them as newer and fresher. Therefore such devotees cannot give up
hearing of the pastimes of Lord Krsna. premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti.
The word santah is used to refer to persons who have developed love for Krsna. Yam syamasundaram acintya-gunasvarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami (Brahma-samhita 5.38). Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, is
addressed as bhagavatottama, the best of devotees, because unless one is very much elevated in devotional service,
one cannot feel ecstasy from hearing more and more and appreciate the topics as ever fresher and newer.

satam--of the devotees; ayam--this; sara-bhrtam--those who are paramahamsas, who have accepted the essence of
life; nisargah--feature or symptom; yat--which; artha-vani--the aim of life, the aim of profit; sruti--the aim of

striyah--(topics) of woman or sex; vitanam--of debauchees, who are attached to women; iva--exactly like; sadhu
varta--actual conversation.
Paramahamsas, devotees who have accepted the essence of life, are attached to Krsna in the core of their hearts,
and He is the aim of their lives. It is their nature to talk only of Krsna at every moment, as if such topics were
newer and newer. They are attached to such topics, just as materialists are attached to topics of women and sex.
The word sara-bhrtam means paramahamsas. The hamsa, or swan, accepts milk from a mixture of milk and water
and rejects the water. Similarly, the nature of persons who have taken to spiritual life and Krsna consciousness,
understanding Krsna to be the life and soul of everyone, is that they cannot give up krsna-katha, or topics about
Krsna, at any moment. Such paramahamsas always see Krsna within the core of the heart (santah sadaiva hrdayesu
vilokayanti). Kama (desires), krodha (anger) and bhaya (fear) are always present in the material world, but in the
spiritual, or transcendental, world one can use them for Krsna. Kamam krsna-karmarpane. The desire of the
paramahamsas, therefore, is to act always for Krsna. Krodham bhakta-dvesi jane. They use anger against the
nondevotees and transform bhaya, or fear, into fear of being deviated from Krsna consciousness. In this way, the
life of a paramahamsa devotee is used entirely for Krsna, just as the life of a person attached to the material world is
used simply for women and money. What is day for the materialistic person is night for the spiritualist. What is
very sweet for the materialist--namely women and money--is regarded as poison by the spiritualist.
sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca
ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato 'py asadhu
This is the instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu. For the paramahamsa, Krsna is everything, but for the
materialist, women and money are everything.

To a pure devotee, Krsna is always visible, as stated in the Brahma samhita (santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti)
and as indicated by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (sarvatah pani-padam tat sarvato 'ksi-siro-mukham). If by
accumulating pious activities (krta-punya-punjah) one is raised to the platform of pure devotional service, Krsna is
always visible in the core of one's heart. One who has attained such perfection is all-beautiful in transcendental
bliss. The present Krsna consciousness movement is an attempt to keep Krsna in the center, for if this is done all
activities will automatically become beautiful and blissful.

In the presence of Krsna's friendship, a devotee cannot have any fear. Krsna is the supreme controller, the
controller of even death, which is supposed to be the ultimate fear in this material world. Bhayam
dvitiyabhinivesatah syat (Bhag. 11.2.37). This fear arises because of lack of Krsna consciousness; otherwise there
cannot be any fear. For one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, this material world of fear becomes
hardly dangerous at all.

Bhavambudhih, the material ocean of fear, becomes very easy to cross by the mercy of the supreme controller.
This material world, in which there is fear and danger at every step (padam padam yad vipadam), is not meant for
those who have taken shelter at Krsna's lotus feet. Such persons are delivered from this fearful world.

The Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) assert that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do

Still, when there is a need to take care of His friends, He does this personally. Krsna assured His friends, "Don't be

ambhojanma-janih--Lord Brahma, who was born from a lotus flower; tat-antara-gatah--now became entangled

boys made by Krsna's maya; isituh--of the supreme controller; drastum--just to see; manju--very pleasing;

vatsa-pan--and the cowherd boys taking care of the calves; nitva--bringing them; anyatra--to a different place;
kurudvaha--O Maharaja Pariksit; antara-dadhat--kept hidden and invisible for some time; khe avasthitah yah--this
person Brahma, who was situated in the higher planetary system in the sky; pura--formerly; drstva--was observing;
aghasura-moksanam--the wonderful killing and deliverance of Aghasura from material tribulation; prabhavatah--of
the all-potent Supreme Person; praptah param vismayam--had become extremely astonished.
O Maharaja Pariksit, Brahma, who resides in the higher planetary system in the sky, had observed the activities of
the most powerful Krsna in killing and delivering Aghasura, and he was astonished. Now that same Brahma wanted
to show some of his own power and see the power of Krsna, who was engaged in His childhood pastimes, playing
as if with ordinary cowherd boys. Therefore, in Krsna's absence, Brahma took all the boys and calves to another
place. Thus he became entangled, for in the very near future he would see how powerful Krsna was.
When Aghasura was being killed by Krsna, who was accompanied by His associates, Brahma was astonished, but
when he saw that Krsna was very much enjoying His pastimes of lunch, he was even more astonished and wanted
to test whether Krsna was actually there. Thus he became entangled in Krsna's maya. After all, Brahma was born
materially. As mentioned here, ambhojanma janih: he was born of ambhoja, a lotus flower. It does not matter that
he was born of a lotus and not of any man, animal or material father. A lotus is also material, and anyone born
through the material energy must be subject to the four material deficiencies: bhrama (the tendency to commit
mistakes), pramada (the tendency to be illusioned), vipralipsa (the tendency to cheat) and karanapatava (imperfect
senses). Thus Brahma also became entangled.
Brahma, with his maya, wanted to test whether Krsna was actually present. These cowherd boys were but
expansions of Krsna's personal self (ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhih). Later Krsna would show Brahma how
He expands Himself into everything as His personal pleasure, ananda-cinmaya-rasa. Hladini saktir asmat: Krsna has
a transcendental potency called hladini sakti. He does not enjoy anything that is a product of the material energy.
Brahma, therefore, would see Lord Krsna expand His energy.
Brahma wanted to take away Krsna's associates, but instead he took away some other boys and calves. Ravana
wanted to take away Sita, but that was impossible, and instead he took away a maya Sita. Similarly, Brahma took
away mayarbhakah: boys manifested by Krsna's maya. Brahma could show some extraordinary opulence to the
mayarbhakah; but he could not show any extraordinary potency to Krsna's associates. That he would see in the
very near future. Mayarbhakasya isituh. This bewilderment, this maya, was caused by the supreme controller,
prabhavatah--the all-potent Supreme person, Krsna--and we shall see the result. Anyone materially born is subject
to bewilderment. This pastime is therefore called brahma-vimohana-lila, the pastime of bewildering Brahma.
Mohitam nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam (Bg. 7.13). Materially born persons cannot fully understand
Krsna. Even the demigods cannot understand Him (muhyanti yat surayah). Tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye (Bhag.
1.1.1). Everyone, from Brahma down to the small insect, must take lessons from Krsna.

Thereafter, when Krsna was unable to find the calves, He returned to the bank of the river, but there He was also
unable to see the cowherd boys. Thus He began to search for both the calves and the boys, as if He could not
understand what had happened.
Krsna could immediately understand that Brahma had taken away both the calves and the boys, but as an
innocent child He searched here and there so that Brahma could not understand Krsna's maya. This was all a
dramatic performance. A player knows everything, but still he plays on the stage in such a way that others do not
understand him.

When Krsna was unable to find the calves and their caretakers, the cowherd boys, anywhere in the forest, He
could suddenly understand that this was the work of Lord Brahma.
Although Krsna is visva-vit, the knower of everything happening in the entire cosmic manifestation, as an
innocent child He showed ignorance of Brahma's actions, although He could immediately understand that these
were the doings of Brahma. This pastime is called brahma-vimohana, the bewilderment of Brahma. Brahma was
already bewildered by Krsna's activities as an innocent child, and now he would be further bewildered.

Thereafter, just to create pleasure both for Brahma and for the mothers of the calves and cowherd boys, Krsna,
the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation, expanded Himself as calves and boys.
Although Brahma was already entangled in bewilderment, he wanted to show his power to the cowherd boys; but
after he took away the boys and their calves and returned to his abode, Krsna created further astonishment for
Brahma, and for the mothers of the boys, by establishing the lunch pastimes in the forest again and replacing all the
calves and boys, just as they had appeared before. According to the Vedas, ekam bahu syam: the Personality of
Godhead can become many, many millions upon millions of calves and cowherd boys, as He did to bewilder
Brahma more and more.

By His Vasudeva feature, Krsna simultaneously expanded Himself into the exact number of missing cowherd
boys and calves, with their exact bodily features, their particular types of hands, legs and other limbs, their sticks,
bugles and flutes, their lunch bags, their particular types of dress and ornaments placed in various ways, their
names, ages and forms, and their special activities and characteristics. By expanding Himself in this way, beautiful
Krsna proved the statement samagra-jagad visnumayam: "Lord Visnu is all-pervading."
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.33):
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
Krsna, param brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is adyam, the beginning of everything; He is adipurusam,
the ever-youthful original person. He can expand Himself in more forms than one can imagine, yet He
does not fall down from His original form as Krsna; therefore He is called Acyuta. This is the Supreme personality
of Godhead. Sarvam visnumayam jagat. Sarvam khalv idam brahma. Krsna thus proved that He is everything, that
He can become everything, but that still He is personally different from everything (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani na
caham tesv avasthitah). This is Krsna, who is understood by acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philosophy. purnasya
purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate: Krsna is always complete, and although He can create millions of universes, all
of them full in all opulences, He remains as opulent as ever, without any change (advaitam). This is explained by
different Vaisnava acaryas through philosophies such as visuddhadvaita, visistadvaita and dvaitadvaita. Therefore
one must learn about Krsna from the acaryas. Acaryavan puruso veda: one who follows the path of the acaryas
knows things as they are. Such a person can know Krsna as He is, at least to some extent, and as soon as one
understands Krsna (janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah), one is liberated from material bondage
(tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna).

calves that were also He Himself; prativarya atma-vatsapaih--again He Himself was represented as the cowherd boys
controlling and commanding the calves; kridan--thus Himself constituting everything in these transcendental

Now expanding Himself so as to appear as all the calves and cowherd boys, all of them as they were, and at the
same time appear as their leader, Krsna entered Vrajabhumi, the land of His father, Nanda Maharaja, just as He
usually did while enjoying their company.
Krsna usually stayed in the forest and pasturing ground, taking care of the calves and cows with His associates
the cowherd boys. Now that the original group had been taken away by Brahma, Krsna Himself assumed the forms
of every member of the group, without anyone's knowledge, even the knowledge of Baladeva, and continued the
usual program. He was ordering His friends to do this and that, and He was controlling the calves and going into
the forest to search for them when they went astray, allured by new grass, but these calves and boys were He
Himself. This was Krsna's inconceivable potency. As explained by Srila Jiva Gosvami, radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir
hladini saktir asmat. Radha and Krsna are the same. Krsna, by expanding His pleasure potency, becomes
Radharani. The same pleasure potency (ananda-cinmaya-rasa) was expanded by Krsna when He Himself became all
the calves and boys and enjoyed transcendental bliss in Vrajabhumi. This was done by the yogamaya potency and
was inconceivable to persons under the potency of mahamaya.

The mothers of the boys, upon hearing the sounds of the flutes and bugles being played by their sons,
immediately rose from their household tasks, lifted their boys onto their laps, embraced them with both arms and
began to feed them with their breast milk, which flowed forth because of extreme love specifically for Krsna.
Actually Krsna is everything, but at that time, expressing extreme love and affection, they took special pleasure in
feeding Krsna, the Parabrahman, and Krsna drank the milk from His respective mothers as if it were a nectarean
beverage.
Although all the elderly gopis knew that Krsna was the son of mother Yasoda, they still desired, "If Krsna had
become my son, I would also have taken care of Him like mother Yasoda. "This was their inner ambition. Now, in
order to please them, Krsna personally took the role of their sons and fulfilled their desire. They enhanced their
special love for Krsna by embracing Him and feeding Him, and Krsna tasted their breast milk to be just like a
nectarean beverage. While thus bewildering Brahma, He enjoyed the special transcendental pleasure created by
yogamaya between all the other mothers and Himself.

Previously, from the very beginning, the gopis had motherly affection for Krsna. Indeed, their affection for Krsna
exceeded even their affection for their own sons. In displaying their affection, they had thus distinguished between
Krsna and their sons, but now that distinction disappeared.
The distinction between one's own son and another's son is not unnatural. Many elderly women have motherly
affection for the sons of others. They observe distinctions, however, between those other sons and their own. But
now the elderly gopis could not distinguish between their own sons and Krsna, for since their own sons had been
taken by Brahma, Krsna had expanded as their sons. Therefore, their extra affection for their sons, who were now
Krsna Himself, was due to bewilderment resembling that of Brahma. Previously, the mothers of Sridama, Sudama,
Subala and Krsna's other friends did not have the same affection for one another's sons, but now the gopis treated
all the boys as their own. Sukadeva Gosvami, therefore, wanted to explain this increment of affection in terms of
Krsna's bewilderment of Brahma, the gopis, the cows and everyone else.

The cowherd men, having been unable to check the cows from going to their calves, felt simultaneously ashamed
and angry. They crossed the rough road with great difficulty, but when they came down and saw their own sons,
they were overwhelmed by great affection.
Everyone was increasing in affection for Krsna. When the cowherd men coming down from the hill saw their
own sons, who were no one else than Krsna, their affection increased.

At that time, all the thoughts of the cowherd men merged in the mellow of paternal love, which was aroused by
the sight of their sons. Experiencing a great attraction, their anger completely disappearing, they lifted their sons,
embraced them in their arms and enjoyed the highest pleasure by smelling their sons' heads.
After Brahma stole the original cowherd boys and calves, Krsna expanded Himself to become the boys and calves
again. Therefore, because the boys were actually Krsna's expansions, the cowherd men were especially attracted to
them. At first the cowherd men, who were on top of the hill, were angry, but because of Krsna the boys were
extremely attractive, and therefore the cowherd men immediately came down from the hill with special affection.

In the beginning the cowherd men were angry that the cows were being attracted by the calves, but when the
men came down from the hill, they themselves were attracted by their sons, and therefore the men embraced them.
To embrace one's son and smell his head are symptoms of affection.

Because of an increase of affection, the cows had constant attachment even to those calves that were grown up
and had stopped sucking milk from their mothers. When Baladeva saw this attachment, He was unable to
understand the reason for it, and thus He began to consider as follows.
The cows had younger calves who had started sucking milk from their mothers, and some of the cows had newly
given birth, but now, because of love, the cows enthusiastically showed their affection for the older calves, which
had left off milking. These calves were grown up, but still the mothers wanted to feed them. Therefore Balarama
was a little surprised, and He wanted to inquire from Krsna about the reason for their behavior. The mothers were
actually more anxious to feed the older calves, although the new calves were present, because the older calves were
expansions of Krsna. These surprising events were taking place by the manipulation of yogamaya. There are two
mayas working under the direction of Krsna--mahamaya, the energy of the material world, and yogamaya, the
energy of the spiritual world. These uncommon events were taking place because of the influence of yogamaya.
From the very day on which Brahma stole the calves and boys, yogamaya acted in such a way that the residents of
Vrndavana, including even Lord Balarama, could not understand how yogamaya was working and causing such
uncommon things to happen. But as yogamaya gradually acted, Balarama in particular was able to understand what
was happening, and therefore He inquired from Krsna.

What is this wonderful phenomenon? The affection of all the inhabitants of Vraja, including Me, toward these
boys and calves is increasing as never before, just like our affection for Lord Krsna, the Supersoul of all living
entities.
This increase of affection was not maya; rather, because Krsna had expanded Himself as everything and because
the whole life of everyone in Vrndavana was meant for Krsna, the cows, because of affection for Krsna, had more
affection for the older calves than for the new calves, and the men increased in their affection for their sons.
Balarama was astonished to see all the residents of Vrndavana so affectionate toward their own children, exactly as
they had been for Krsna. Similarly, the cows had grown affectionate toward their calves--as much as toward Krsna.
Balarama was surprised to see the acts of yogamaya. Therefore He inquired from Krsna, "What is happening here?
What is this mystery?"

Who is this mystic power, and where has she come from? Is she a demigod or a demoness? She must be the

Balarama was surprised. This extraordinary show of affection, He thought, was something mystical, performed
either by the demigods or some wonderful man. Otherwise, how could this wonderful change take place? "This
maya might be some raksasi-maya," He thought, "but how can raksasi-maya have any influence upon Me? This is
not possible. Therefore it must be the maya of Krsna." He thus concluded that the mystical change must have been
caused by Krsna, whom Balarama considered His worshipable personality of Godhead. He thought, "It was
arranged by Krsna, and even I could not check its mystic power." Thus Balarama understood that all these boys
and calves were only expansions of Krsna.

Thinking in this way, Lord Balarama was able to see, with the eye of transcendental knowledge, that all these
calves and Krsna's friends were expansions of the form of Sri Krsna.
Every individual is different. There are even differences between twin brothers. Yet when Krsna expanded
Himself as the boys and calves, each boy and each calf appeared in its own original feature, with the same
individual way of acting, the same tendencies, the same color, the same dress, and so on, for Krsna manifested
Himself with all these differences. This was Krsna's opulence.

situation; prabhuna--(having been explained) by Lord Krsna; balah--Baladeva; avait--understood.
Lord Baladeva said, "O supreme controller! These boys are not great demigods, as I previously thought. Nor are
these calves great sages like Narada. Now I can see that You alone are manifesting Yourself in all varieties of
difference. Although one, You are existing in the different forms of the calves and boys. Please briefly explain this
to Me." Having thus been requested by Lord Baladeva, Krsna explained the whole situation, and Baladeva
understood it.
Inquiring from Krsna about the actual situation, Lord Balarama said, "My dear Krsna, in the beginning I thought
that all these cows, calves and cowherd boys were either great sages and saintly persons or demigods, but at the
present it appears that they are actually Your expansions. They are all You; You Yourself are playing as the calves
and cows and boys. What is the mystery of this situation? Where have those other calves and cows and boys gone?
And why are You expanding Yourself as the cows, calves and boys? Will You kindly tell Me what is the cause?" At
the request of Balarama, Krsna briefly explained the whole situation: how the calves and boys were stolen by
Brahma and how He was concealing the incident by expanding Himself so that people would not know that the
original cows, calves and boys were missing. Balarama understood, therefore, that this was not maya but Krsna's
opulence. Krsna has all opulences, and this was but another opulence of Krsna.
"At first," Lord Balarama said, "I thought that these boys and calves were a display of the power of great sages
like Narada, but now I see that all these boys and calves are You." After inquiring from Krsna, Lord Balarama
understood that Krsna Himself had become many. That the Lord can do this is stated in the Brahma-samhita
(5.33). Advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam: although He is one, He can expand Himself in so many forms.
According to the Vedic version, ekam bahu syam: He can expand Himself into many thousands and millions but
still remain one. In that sense, everything is spiritual because everything is an expansion of Krsna; that is,
everything is an expansion either of Krsna Himself or of His potency. Because the potency is nondifferent from the
potent, the potency and the potent are one (sakti-saktimatayor abhedah). The Mayavadis, however, say, cid-acitsamanvayah:
spirit and matter are one. This is a wrong conception. Spirit (cit) is different from matter (acit), as
explained by Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My separated
material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine,
which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe." Spirit
and matter cannot be made one, for actually they are superior and inferior energies, yet the Mayavadis, or Advaitavadis,
try to make them one. This is wrong. Although spirit and matter ultimately come from the same one source,
they cannot be made one. For example, there are many things that come from our bodies, but although they come
from the same source, they cannot be made one. We should be careful to note that although the supreme source is
one, the emanations from this source should be separately regarded as inferior and superior. The difference
between the Mayavada and Vaisnava philosophies is that the Vaisnava philosophy recognizes this fact. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu's philosophy, therefore, is called acintya-bhedabheda--simultaneous oneness and difference. For
example, fire and heat cannot be separated, for where there is fire there is heat and where there is heat there is fire.
Nonetheless, although we cannot touch fire, heat we can tolerate. Therefore, although they are one, they are
different.

measurement of time); kridantam--playing; dadrse--he saw; sa-kalam--along with His expansions; harim--Lord Hari
(Sri Krsna).
When Lord Brahma returned after a moment of time had passed (according to his own measurement), he saw
that although by human measurement a complete year had passed, Lord Krsna, after all that time, was engaged just
as before in playing with the boys and calves, who were His expansions.
Lord Brahma had gone away for only a moment of his time, but when he returned, a year of human time had
passed. On different planets, the calculation of time is different. To give an example, a man-made satellite may
orbit the earth in an hour and twenty-five minutes and thus complete one full day, although a day ordinarily takes
twenty-four hours for those living on earth. Therefore, what was but a moment for Brahma was one year on earth.
Krsna continued to expand Himself in so many forms for one year, but by the arrangement of yogamaya no one
could understand this but Balarama.
After one moment of Brahma's calculation, Brahma came back to see the fun caused by his stealing the boys and
calves. But he was also afraid that he was playing with fire. Krsna was his master, and he had played mischief for
fun by taking away Krsna's calves and boys. He was really anxious, so he did not stay away very long; he came back
after a moment (of his calculation). When Brahma returned, he saw that all the boys, calves and cows were playing
with Krsna in the same way as when he had come upon them; by Krsna's display of yogamaya, the same pastimes
were going on without any change.
On the day when Lord Brahma had first come, Baladeva could not go with Krsna and the cowherd boys, for it was
His birthday, and His mother had kept Him back for the proper ceremonial bath, called santika-snana. Therefore
Lord Baladeva was not taken by Brahma at that time. Now, one year later, Brahma returned, and because he
returned on exactly the same day, Baladeva was again kept at home for His birthday. Therefore, although this verse
mentions that Brahma saw Krsna and all the cowherd boys, Baladeva is not mentioned. It was five or six days
earlier that Baladeva had inquired from Krsna about the extraordinary affection of the cows and cowherd men, but
now, when Brahma returned, Brahma saw all the calves and cowherd boys playing with Krsna as expansions of
Krsna, but he did not see Baladeva. As in the previous year, Lord Baladeva did not go to the woods on the day Lord
Brahma appeared there.

Lord Brahma thought: Whatever boys and calves there were in Gokula, I have kept them sleeping on the bed of
my mystic potency, and to this very day they have not yet risen again.
For one year Lord Brahma kept the calves and boys lying down in a cave by his mystic power. Therefore when
Brahma saw Lord Krsna still playing with all the cows and calves, he began trying to reason about what was
happening. "What is this?" he thought. "Maybe I took those calves and cowherd boys away but now they have been
taken from that cave. Is this what has happened? Has Krsna brought them back here?" Then, however, Lord
Brahma saw that the calves and boys he had taken were still in the same mystic maya into which he had put them.
Thus he concluded that the calves and cowherd boys now playing with Krsna were different from the ones in the
cave. He could understand that although the original calves and boys were still in the cave where he had put them,
Krsna had expanded Himself and so the present demonstration of calves and boys consisted of expansions of
Krsna. They had the same features, the same mentality and the same intentions, but they were all Krsna.

A similar number of boys and calves have been playing with Krsna for one whole year, yet they are different from

Although appearing like calves, cows and cowherd boys, these were all Visnu. Actually they were visnu-tattva,
not jiva-tattva. Brahma was surprised. "The original cowherd boys and cows," he thought, "are still where I put
them last year. So who is it that is now keeping company with Krsna exactly as before? Where have they come
from?" Brahma was surprised that his mystic power had been neglected. Without touching the original cows and
cowherd boys kept by Brahma, Krsna had created another assembly of calves and boys, who were all expansions of
visnu-tattva. Thus Brahma's mystic power was superseded.

Brahma was puzzled. "The original boys and calves are still sleeping as I have kept them," he thought, "but
another set is here playing with Krsna. How has this happened?" Brahma could not grasp what was happening.
Which boys were real, and which were not real? Brahma was unable to come to any definite conclusion. He
pondered the matter for a long while. "How can there be two sets of calves and boys at the same time? Have the
boys and calves here been created by Krsna, or has Krsna created the ones lying asleep? Or are both merely
creations of Krsna?" Brahma thought about the subject in many different ways. "After I go to the cave and see that
the boys and calves are still there, does Krsna go take them away and put them here so that I come here and see
them, and does Krsna then take them from here and put them there?" Brahma could not figure out how there
could be two sets of calves and cowherd boys exactly alike. Although thinking and thinking, he could not
understand at all.

Thus because Lord Brahma wanted to mystify the all-pervading Lord Krsna, who can never be mystified, but
who, on the contrary, mystifies the entire universe, he himself was put into bewilderment by his own mystic
power.
Brahma wanted to bewilder Krsna, who bewilders the entire universe. The whole universe is under Krsna's mystic
power (mama maya duratyaya), but Brahma wanted to mystify Him. The result was that Brahma himself was
mystified, just as one who wants to kill another may himself be killed. In other words, Brahma was defeated by his
own attempt. In a similar position are the scientists and philosophers who want to overcome the mystic power of
Krsna. They challenge Krsna, saying, "What is God? We can do this, and we can do that." But the more they
challenge Krsna in this way, the more they are implicated in suffering. The lesson here is that we should not try to
overcome Krsna. Rather, instead of endeavoring to surpass Him, we should surrender to Him (sarva-dharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja).
Instead of defeating Krsna, Brahma himself was defeated, for he could not understand what Krsna was doing.
Since Brahma, the chief person within this universe, was so bewildered, what is to be said of so-called scientists and
philosophers? Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. We should give up all our tiny efforts to defy
the arrangement of Krsna. Instead, whatever arrangements He proposes, we should accept. This is always better, for
this will make us happy. The more we try to defeat the arrangement of Krsna, the more we become implicated in
Krsna's maya (daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya). But one who has reached the point of surrendering
to the instructions of Krsna (mam eva ye prapadyante) is liberated, free from krsna-maya (mayam etam taranti te).
The power of Krsna is just like a government that cannot be overcome. First of all there are laws, and then there is
police power, and beyond that is military power. Therefore, what is the use of trying to overcome the power of the
government? Similarly, what is the use of trying to challenge Krsna?
From the next verse it is clear that Krsna cannot be defeated by any kind of mystic power. If one gets even a little
power of scientific knowledge, one tries to defy God, but actually no one is able to bewilder Krsna. When Brahma,
the chief person within the universe, tried to bewilder Krsna, he himself was bewildered and astonished. This is the
position of the conditioned soul. Brahma wanted to mystify Krsna, but he himself was mystified.
The word visnum is significant in this verse. Visnu pervades the entire material world, whereas Brahma merely
occupies one subordinate post.
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vila-ja jagadanda-nathah
(Brahma-samhita 5.48)
The word nathah, which refers to Lord Brahma, is plural because there are innumerable universes and
innumerable Brahmas. Brahma is but a tiny force. This was exhibited in Dvaraka when Krsna called for Brahma.
One day when Brahma came to see Krsna at Dvaraka, the doorman, at Lord Krsna's request, asked, "Which Brahma
are you?" Later, when Brahma inquired from Krsna whether this meant that there was more than one Brahma,
Krsna smiled and at once called for many Brahmas from many universes. The four-headed Brahma of this universe
then saw innumerable other Brahmas coming to see Krsna and offer their respects. Some of them had ten heads,
some had twenty, some had a hundred and some had a million heads. Upon seeing this wonderful exhibition, the
four-headed Brahma became nervous and began to think of himself as no more than a mosquito in the midst of
many elephants. Therefore, what can Brahma do to bewilder Krsna?

As the darkness of snow on a dark night and the light of a glowworm in the light of day have no value, the mystic
power of an inferior person who tries to use it against a person of great power is unable to accomplish anything;
instead, the power of that inferior person is diminished.
When one wants to supersede a superior power, one's own inferior power becomes ludicrous. Just as a glowworm
in the daytime and snow at night have no value, Brahma's mystic power became worthless in the presence of Krsna,
for greater mystic power condemns inferior mystic power. On a dark night, the darkness produced by snow has no
meaning. The glowworm appears very important at night, but in the daytime its glow has no value; whatever little
value it has is lost. Similarly, Brahma became insignificant in the presence of Krsna's mystic power. Krsna's maya
was not diminished in value, but Brahma's maya was condemned. Therefore, one should not try to exhibit one's
insignificant opulence before a greater power.

Then, while Lord Brahma looked on, all the calves and the boys tending them immediately appeared to have
complexions the color of bluish rainclouds and to be dressed in yellow silken garments.
While Brahma was contemplating, all the calves and cowherd boys immediately transformed into visnu-murtis,
having bluish complexions and wearing yellow garments. Brahma was contemplating his own power and the
immense, unlimited power of Krsna, but before he could come to a conclusion, he saw this immediate
transformation.

bearing the emblem of the goddess of fortune on Their chests, armlets on Their arms, the Kaustubha gem
on Their necks, which were marked with three lines like a conchshell, and bracelets on Their hands; nupuraih--
with ornaments on the feet; katakaih--with bangles on Their ankles; bhatah--appeared beautiful; kati-sutra-anguliyakaih--
with sacred belts around the waist and with rings on the fingers.
All those personalities had four arms, holding conchshell, disc, mace and lotus flower in Their hands. They wore
helmets on Their heads, earrings on Their ears and garlands of forest flowers around Their necks. On the upper
portion of the right side of Their chests was the emblem of the goddess of fortune. Furthermore, They wore armlets
on Their arms, the Kaustubha gem around Their necks, which were marked with three lines like a conchshell, and
bracelets on Their wrists. With bangles on Their ankles, ornaments on Their feet, and sacred belts around Their
waists, They all appeared very beautiful.
All the Visnu forms had four arms, with conchshell and other articles, but these characteristics are also possessed
by those who have attained sarupya-mukti in Vaikuntha and who consequently have forms exactly like the form of
the Lord. However, these Visnu forms appearing before Lord Brahma also possessed the mark of Srivatsa and the
Kaustubha gem, which are special characteristics possessed only by the Supreme Lord Himself. This proves that all
these boys and calves were in fact directly expansions of Visnu, the Personality of Godhead, not merely His
associates of Vaikuntha. Visnu Himself is included within Krsna. All the opulences of Visnu are already present in
Krsna, and consequently for Krsna to demonstrate so many Visnu forms was actually not very astonishing.
The Srivatsa mark is described by the Vaisnava-tosani as being a curl of fine yellow hair on the upper portion of
the right side of Lord Visnu's chest. This mark is not for ordinary devotees. It is a special mark of Visnu or Krsna.

Every part of Their bodies, from Their feet to the top of Their heads, was fully decorated with fresh, tender
garlands of tulasi leaves offered by devotees engaged in worshiping the Lord by the greatest pious activities, namely
hearing and chanting.
The word bhuri-punyavad-arpitaih is significant in this verse. These forms of Visnu were worshiped by those
who had performed pious activities (sukrtibhih) for many births and who were constantly engaged in devotional
service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh). Bhakti, devotional service, is the engagement of those who have performed
highly developed pious activities. The accumulation of pious activities has already been mentioned elsewhere in
the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.12.11), where Sukadeva Gosvami says,
ittham satam brahma-sukhanubhutya
dasyam gatanam para-daivatena
mayasritanam nara-darakena
sakam vijahruh krta-punya-punjah
"Those who are engaged in self-realization, appreciating the Brahman effulgence of the Lord, and those engaged
in devotional service, accepting the Supreme personality of Godhead as master, as well as those who are under the
clutches of maya, thinking the Lord an ordinary person, cannot understand that certain exalted personalities--after
accumulating volumes of pious activities--are now playing with the Lord in friendship as cowherd boys."
In our Krsna-Balarama Temple in Vrndavana, there is a tamala tree that covers an entire corner of the courtyard.
Before there was a temple the tree was lying neglected, but now it has developed very luxuriantly, covering the
whole corner of the courtyard. This is a sign of bhuri-punya.

candrika-visada-smeraih--by pure smiling like the full, increasing moonlight; sa-aruna-apanga-viksitaih--by the
clear glances of Their reddish eyes; svaka-arthanam--of the desires of His own devotees; iva--just as; rajahsattvabhyam--
by the modes of passion and goodness; srastr-palakah--were creators and protectors.
Those Visnu forms, by Their pure smiling, which resembled the increasing light of the moon, and by the sidelong
glances of Their reddish eyes, created and protected the desires of Their own devotees, as if by the modes of
passion and goodness.
Those Visnu forms blessed the devotees with Their clear glances and smiles, which resembled the increasingly
full light of the moon (sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranam). As maintainers, They glanced upon Their devotees,
embracing them and protecting them by smiling. Their smiles resembled the mode of goodness, protecting all the
desires of the devotees, and the glancing of Their eyes resembled the mode of passion. Actually, in this verse the
word rajah means not "passion" but "affection." In the material world, rajo-guna is passion, but in the spiritual
world it is affection. In the material world, affection is contaminated by rajo-guna and tamo-guna, but in the
suddha-sattva the affection that maintains the devotees is transcendental.
The word svakarthanam refers to great desires. As mentioned in this verse, the glance of Lord Visnu creates the
desires of the devotees. A pure devotee, however, has no desires. Therefore Sanatana Gosvami comments that
because the desires of devotees whose attention is fixed on Krsna have already been fulfilled, the Lord's sidelong
glances create variegated desires in relation to Krsna and devotional service. In the material world, desire is a
product of rajo-guna and tamo-guna, hilt desire in the spiritual world gives rise to a variety of everlasting
transcendental service. Thus the word svakarthanam refers to eagerness to serve Krsna.
In Vrndavana there is a place where there was no temple, but a devotee desired, "Let there be a temple and seva,
devotional service." Therefore, what was once an empty corner has now become a place of pilgrimage. Such are the
desires of a devotee.

atma-adi-stamba-paryantaih--from Lord Brahma to the insignificant living entity; murti-madbhih--assuming some
form; cara-acaraih--both the moving and the nonmoving; nrtya-gita-adi-aneka-arhaih--by many varied means of
worship, such as dancing and singing; prthak prthak--differently; upasitah--who were being worshiped.
All beings, both moving and nonmoving, from the four-headed Lord Brahma down to the most insignificant
living entity, had taken forms and were differently worshiping those visnu-murtis, according to their respective
capacities, with various means of worship, such as dancing and singing.
Innumerable living entities are engaged in different types of worship of the Supreme, according to their abilities
and karma, but everyone is engaged (jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa'); there is no one who is not serving.
Therefore the maha-bhagavata, the topmost devotee, sees everyone as being engaged in the service of Krsna; only
himself does he see as not engaged. We have to elevate ourselves from a lower position to a higher position, and
the topmost position is that of direct service in Vrndavana. But everyone is engaged in service. Denial of the service
of the Lord is maya.
ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
"Only Krsna is the supreme master, and all others are His servants. As Krsna desires, everyone dances according
to His tune.' (Cc. Adi 5.142)
There are two kinds of living entities--the moving and the nonmoving. Trees, for example, stand in one place,
whereas ants move. Brahma saw that all of them, down to the smallest creatures, had assumed different forms and
were accordingly engaged in the service of Lord Visnu.
One receives a form according to the way one worships the Lord. In the material world, the body one receives is
guided by the demigods. This is sometimes referred to as the influence of the stars. As indicated in Bhagavad-gita
(3.27) by the words prakrteh kriyamanani, according to the laws of nature one is controlled by the demigods.
All living entities are serving Krsna in different ways, but when they are Krsna conscious, their service is fully
manifest. As a flower in the bud gradually fructifies and yields its desired aroma and beauty, so when a living entity
comes to the platform of Krsna consciousness, the beauty of his real form comes into full blossom. That is the
ultimate beauty and the ultimate fulfillment of desire.

All the visnu-murtis were surrounded by the opulences, headed by anima-siddhi; by the mystic potencies, headed
by Aja; and by the twenty-four elements for the creation of the material world, headed by the mahat-tattva.
In this verse the word mahimabhih means aisvarya, or opulence. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can do
whatever He likes. That is His aisvarya. No one can command Him, but He can command everyone. Sad-aisvaryapurnam.
The Lord is full in six opulences. The yoga-siddhis, the perfections of yoga, such as the ability to become
smaller than the smallest (anima-siddhi) or bigger than the biggest (mahima-siddhi), are present in Lord Visnu.
Sad-aisvaryaih purno ya iha bhagavan (Cc. Adi 1.3). The word aja means maya, or mystic power. Everything

The twenty-four elements mentioned are the five working senses (panca-karmendriya), the five senses for
obtaining knowledge (panca-jnanendriya), the five gross material elements (panca-mahabhuta), the five sense
objects (panca-tanmatra), the mind (manas), the false ego (ahankara), the mahat-tattva, and material nature

Then Lord Brahma saw that kala (the time factor), svabhava (one's own nature by association), samskara
(reformation), kama (desire), karma (fruitive activity) and the gunas (the three modes of material nature), their
own independence being completely subordinate to the potency of the Lord, had all taken forms and were also
worshiping those visnu-murtis.
No one but Visnu has any independence. If we develop consciousness of this fact, then we are in actual Krsna
consciousness. We should always remember that Krsna is the only supreme master and that everyone else is His
servant (ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya). Be one even Narayana or Lord Siva, everyone is subordinate to Krsna
(siva-virincinutam). Even Baladeva is subordinate to Krsna. This is a fact.
ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
(Cc. Adi 5.142>
One should understand that no one is independent, for everything is part and parcel of Krsna and is acting and
moving by the supreme desire of Krsna. This understanding, this consciousness, is Krsna consciousness.

"A person who considers demigods like Brahma and Siva to be on an equal level with Narayana must certainly be
considered an offender." No one can compare to Narayana, or Krsna. Krsna is Narayana, and Narayana is also
Krsna, for Krsna is the original Narayana. Brahma himself addressed Krsna, narayanas tvam na hi sarva-dehinam:
"You are also Narayana. Indeed, You are the original Narayana." (Bhag. 10.14.14)
Kala, or the time factor, has many assistants, such as svabhava, samskara, kama, karma and guna. Svabhava, or
one's own nature, is formed according to the association of the material qualities. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sadasad-
yoni janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Sat and asat-svabhava--one's higher or lower nature--is formed by association with
the different qualities, namely sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. We should gradually come to the sattvaguna,
so that we may avoid the two lower gunas. This can be done if we regularly discuss Srimad-Bhagavatam and
hear about Krsna's activities. Nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya (Bhag. 1.2.18). All the activities of
Krsna described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, beginning even with the pastimes concerning Putana, are transcendental.
Therefore, by hearing and discussing Srimad-Bhagavatam, the rajo-guna and tamo-guna are subdued, so that only
sattva-guna remains. Then rajo-guna and tamo-guna cannot do us any harm.
Varnasrama-dharma, therefore, is essential, for it can bring people to sattva-guna. Tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kamalobhadayas
ca ye (Bhag. 1.2.19). Tamo-guna and rajo-guna increase lust and greed, which implicate a living entity
in such a way that he must exist in this material world in many, many forms. That is very dangerous. One should
therefore be brought to sattva-guna by the establishment of varnasrama-dharma and should develop the
brahminical qualifications of being very neat and clean, rising early in the morning and seeing mangala-aratrika,
and so on. In this way, one should stay in sattva-guna, and then one cannot be influenced by tamo-guna and rajoguna.
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham

(Bhag. 1.2.19)
The opportunity for this purification is the special feature of human life; in other lives, this is not possible. Such
purification can be achieved very easily by radha-krsna-bhajana, devotional service rendered to Radha and Krsna,
and therefore Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu, indicating that unless one worships
Radha-Krsna, one's human form of life is wasted. Vasudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah. janayaty asu
vairagyam (Bhag. 1.2.7). By engagement in the service of Vasudeva, one very quickly renounces material life. The
members of the Krsna consciousness movement, for example, being engaged in vasudeva-bhakti, very quickly
come to the stage of being nice Vaisnavas, so much so that people are surprised that mlecchas and yavanas are able
to come to this stage. This is possible by vasudeva-bhakti. But if we do not come to the stage of sattva-guna in this
human life, then, as Narottama dasa Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu--there is no profit in gaining
this human form of life.
Sri Viraraghava Acarya comments that each of the items mentioned in the first half of this verse is a cause for
material entanglement. Kala, or the time factor, agitates the modes of material nature, and svabhava is the result of
association with these modes. Therefore Narottama dasa Thakura says, bhakta-sane vasa. If one associates with
bhaktas, then one's svabhava, or nature, will change. Our Krsna consciousness movement is meant to give people
good association so that this change may take place, and we actually see that by this method people all over the
world are gradually becoming devotees.
As for samskara, or reformation, this is possible by good association, for by good association one develops good
habits, and habit becomes second nature. Therefore, bhakta-sane vasa: let people have the chance to live with
bhaktas. Then their habits will change. In the human form of life one has this chance, but as Narottama dasa
Thakura sings, hari hari viphale janama gonainu: if one fails to take advantage of this opportunity, one's human life
is wasted. We are therefore trying to save human society from degradation and actually elevate people to the higher
nature.
As for kama and karma--desires and activities--if one engages in devotional service, one develops a different
nature than if one engages in activities of sense gratification, and of course the result is also different. According to
the association of different natures, one receives a particular type of body. Karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni
janmasu (Bg. 13.22). Therefore we should always seek good association, the association of devotees. Then our life
will be successful. A man is known by his company. If one has the chance to live in the good association of
devotees, one is able to cultivate knowledge, and naturally one's character or nature will change for one's eternal
benefit.

The visnu-murtis all had eternal, unlimited forms, full of knowledge and bliss and existing beyond the influence
of time. Their great glory was not even to be touched by the jnanis engaged in studying the Upanisads.
Mere sastra jnana, or knowledge in the Vedas, does not help anyone understand the personality of Godhead.
Only one who is favored or shown mercy by the Lord can understand Him. This is also explained in the Upanisads
(Mundaka Upanisad 3.2.3):
nayam atma pravacanena labhyo
na medhasa na bahuna srutena
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tanum svam
"The Supreme Lord is not obtained by expert explanations, by vast intelligence, or even by much hearing. He is
obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person, He manifests His own form."
One description given of Brahman is satyam brahma, ananda-rupam: "Brahman is the Absolute Truth and
complete ananda, or bliss." The forms of Visnu, the Supreme Brahman, were one, but They were manifested
differently. The followers of the Upanisads, however, cannot understand the varieties manifested by Brahman. This
proves that Brahman and Paramatma can actually he understood only through devotion, as confirmed by the Lord
Himself in Srimad-Bhagavatam: bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah (Bhag. 11.14.21). To establish that Brahman indeed has
transcendental form, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives various quotations from the sastras. In the
Svetasvatara Upanisad (3.8), the Supreme is described as aditya-varnam tamasah parastat, "He whose self-manifest
form is luminous like the sun and transcendental to the darkness of ignorance." Ananda-matram ajaram puranam
ekam santam bahudha drsyamanam: "The Supreme is blissful, with no tinge of unhappiness. Although He is the
oldest, He never ages, and although one, He is experienced in different forms." Sarve nityah sasvatas ca dehas tasya
paratmanah: "All the forms of that Supreme Person are eternal." (Maha-varaha purana) The Supreme Person has a
form, with hands and legs and other personal features, but His hands and legs are not material. Bhaktas know that
the form of Krsna, or Brahman, is not at all material. Rather, Brahman has a transcendental form, and when one is
absorbed in it, being fully developed in bhakti, one can understand Him (premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena).
The Mayavadis, however, cannot understand this transcendental form, for they think that it is material.
Transcendental forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His person are so great that the impersonal
followers of the Upanisads cannot reach the platform of knowledge to understand them. Particularly, the
transcendental forms of the Lord are beyond the reach of the impersonalists, who can only understand, through the
studies of the Upanisads, that the Absolute Truth is not matter and that the Absolute Truth is not materially
restricted by limited potency.
Yet although Krsna cannot be seen through the Upanisads, in some places it is said that Krsna can in fact be
known in this way. Aupanisadam purusam: "He is known by the Upanisads." This means that when one is purified
by Vedic knowledge, one is then allowed to enter into devotional understanding (mad-bhaktim labhate param).
tac chraddadhana munayo
jnana-vairagya-yuktaya
pasyanty atmani catmanam
bhaktya sruta-grhitaya
"The seriously inquisitive student or sage, well equipped with knowledge and detachment, realizes that Absolute
Truth by rendering devotional service in terms of what he has heard from the Vedanta-sruti." (Bhag. 1.2.12) The
word sruta-grhitaya refers to Vedanta knowledge, not sentimentality. Sruta-grhita is sound knowledge.
Lord Visnu, Brahma thus realized, is the reservoir of all truth, knowledge and bliss. He is the combination of
these three transcendental features, and He is the object of worship for the followers of the Upanisads. Brahma
realized that all the different forms of cows, boys and calves transformed into Visnu forms were not transformed by
mysticism of the type that a yogi or demigod can display by specific powers invested in him. The cows, calves and
boys transformed into visnu-murtis, or Visnu forms, were not displays of visnu-maya, or Visnu energy, but were
Visnu Himself. The respective qualifications of Visnu and visnu-maya are just like those of fire and heat. In heat
there is the qualification of fire, namely warmth; and yet heat is not fire. The manifestation of the Visnu forms of
the boys, cows and calves was not like the heat, but rather like the fire--they were all actually Visnu. Factually, the
qualification of Visnu is full truth, full knowledge and full bliss. Another example may be given with material
objects, which may be reflected in many, many forms. For example, the sun is reflected in many waterpots, but the
reflections of the sun in many pots are not actually the sun. There is no actual heat and light from the sun in the
pot, although it appears as the sun. But each and every one of the forms Krsna assumed was fully Visnu.
We should discuss Srimad-Bhagavatam daily as much as possible, and then everything will be clarified, for
Bhagavatam is the essence of all Vedic literature (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam). It was written by Vyasadeva
(maha-muni-krte) when he was self-realized. Thus the more we read Srimad-Bhagavatam, the more its knowledge
becomes clear. Each and every verse is transcendental.

Then, by the power of the effulgence of those visnu-murtis, Lord Brahma, his eleven senses jolted by

village deity.
Brahma was stunned because of transcendental bliss (muhyanti yat surayah). In his astonishment, all his senses
were stunned, and he was unable to say or do anything. Brahma had considered himself absolute, thinking himself
the only powerful deity, but now his pride was subdued, and he again became merely one of the demigods--an
important demigod, of course, but a demigod nonetheless. Brahma, therefore, cannot be compared to God--Krsna,
or Narayana. It is forbidden to compare Narayana even to demigods like Brahma and Siva, what to speak of others.

The Supreme Brahman is beyond mental speculation, He is self-manifest, existing in His own bliss, and He is
beyond the material energy. He is known by the crest jewels of the Vedas by refutation of irrelevant knowledge.
Thus in relation to that Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, whose glory had been shown by the
manifestation of all the four-armed forms of Visnu, Lord Brahma, the lord of Sarasvati, was mystified. "What is
this?" he thought, and then he was not even able to see. Lord Krsna, understanding Brahma's position, then at once
removed the curtain of His yogamaya.
Brahma was completely mystified. He could not understand what he was seeing, and then he was not even able to
see. Lord Krsna, understanding Brahma's position, then removed that yogamaya covering. In this verse, Brahma is
referred to as iresa. Ira means Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, and Iresa is her husband, Lord Brahma. Brahma,
therefore, is most intelligent. But even Brahma, the lord of Sarasvati, was bewildered about Krsna. Although he
tried, he could not understand Lord Krsna. In the beginning the boys, the calves and Krsna Himself had been
covered by yogamaya, which later displayed the second set of calves and boys, who were Krsna's expansions, and
which then displayed so many four-armed forms. Now, seeing Brahma's bewilderment, Lord Krsna caused the
disappearance of that yogamaya. One may think that the maya taken away by Lord Krsna was mahamaya, but Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that it was yogamaya, the potency by which Krsna is sometimes manifest
and sometimes not manifest. The potency which covers the actual reality and displays something unreal is
mahamaya, but the potency by which the Absolute Truth is sometimes manifest and sometimes not is yogamaya.
Therefore, in this verse the word aja refers to yogamaya.
Krsna's energy--His maya-sakti, or svarupa-sakti--is one, but it is manifested in varieties. parasya saktir vividhaiva
sruyate (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8). The difference between Vaisnavas and Mayavadis is that Mayavadis say that
this maya is one, whereas Vaisnavas recognize its varieties. There is unity in variety. For example, in one tree, there
are varieties of leaves, fruits and flowers. Varieties of energy are required for performing the varieties of activity
within the creation. To give another example, in a machine all the parts may be iron, but the machine includes
varied activities. Although the whole machine is iron, one part works in one way, and other parts work in other
ways. One who does not know how the machine is working may say that it is all iron; nonetheless, in spite of its
being iron, the machine has different elements, all working differently to accomplish the purpose for which the
machine was made. One wheel runs this way, another wheel runs that way, functioning naturally in such a way
that the work of the machine goes on. Consequently we give different names to the different parts of the machine,
saying, "This is a wheel," "This is a screw," "This is a spindle," "This is the lubrication," and so on. Similarly, as
explained in the Vedas,
parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate
svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca
Krsna's power is variegated, and thus the same sakti, or potency, works in variegated ways. Vividha means
"varieties." There is unity in variety. Thus yogamaya and mahamaya are among the varied individual parts of the
same one potency, and all of these individual potencies work in their own varied ways. The samvit, sandhini and
ahladini potencies--Krsna's potency for existence, His potency for knowledge and His potency for pleasure--are
distinct from yogamaya. Each is an individual potency. The ahladini potency is Radharani. As Svarupa Damodara
Gosvami has explained, radha krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini saktir asmat (Cc. Adi 1.5). The ahladini-sakti is
manifested as Radharani, but Krsna and Radharani are the same, although one is potent and the other is potency.
Brahma was mystified about Krsna's opulence (nija-mahimani) because this opulence was atarkya, or
inconceivable. With one's limited senses, one cannot argue about that which is inconceivable. Therefore the
inconceivable is called acintya, that which is beyond cintya, our thoughts and arguments. Acintya refers to that
which we cannot contemplate but have to accept. Srila Jiva Gosvami has said that unless we accept acintya in the
Supreme, we cannot accommodate the conception of God. This must be understood. Therefore we say that the
words of sastra should be taken as they are, without change, since they are beyond our arguments. Acintyah khalu
ye bhava na tams tarkena yojayet: "That which is acintya cannot be ascertained by argument." People generally
argue, but our process is not to argue but to accept the Vedic knowledge as it is. When Krsna says, "This is
superior, and this is inferior," we accept what He says. It is not that we argue, "Why is this superior and that
inferior?" If one argues, for him the knowledge is lost.
This path of acceptance is called avaroha-pantha The word avaroha is related to the word avatara, which
means"that which descends." The materialist wants to understand everything by the aroha-pantha--by argument
and reason--but transcendental matters cannot be understood in this way. Rather, one must follow the avarohapantha,
the process of descending knowledge. Therefore one must accept the parampara system. And the best
parampara is that which extends from Krsna (evam parampara-praptam). What Krsna says, we should accept
(imam rajarsayo viduh). This is called the avaroha-pantha.
Brahma, however, adopted the aroha-pantha. He wanted to understand Krsna's mystic power by his own limited,
conceivable power, and therefore he himself was mystified. Everyone wants to take pleasure in his own knowledge,
thinking, "I know something." But in the presence of Krsna this conception cannot stand, for one cannot bring
Krsna within the limitations of prakrti. One must submit. There is no alternative. Na tams tarkena yojayet. This
submission marks the difference between Krsna-ites and Mayavadis.
The phrase atan-nirasana refers to the discarding of that which is irrelevant. (Atat means "that which is not a
fact.") Brahman is sometimes described as asthulam ananv ahrasvam adirgham, "that which is not large and not
small, not short and not long." (Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad 5.8.8) Neti neti: "It is not this, it is not that." But what is
it? In describing a pencil, one may say, "It is not this; it is not that," but this does not tell us what it is. This is
called definition by negation. In Bhagavad-gita, Krsna also explains the soul by giving negative definitions. Na
jayate mriyate va: "It is not born, nor does it die. You can hardly understand more than this." But what is it? It is
eternal. Ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano na hanyate hanyamane sarire: "It is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying
and primeval. It is not slain when the body is slain." (Bg. 2.20) In the beginning the soul is difficult to understand,
and therefore Krsna has given negative definitions:
nainam chindanti sastrani
nainam dahati pavakah
na cainam kledayanty apo
na sosayati marutah
"The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can it be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor
withered by the wind." (Bg. 2.23) Krsna says, "It is not burned by fire." Therefore, one has to imagine what it is
that is not burned by fire. This is a negative definition.

Lord Brahma's external consciousness then revived, and he stood up, just like a dead man coming back to life.
Opening his eyes with great difficulty, he saw the universe, along with himself.
We actually do not die. At death, we are merely kept inert for some time, just as during sleep. At night we sleep,
and all our activities stop, but as soon as we arise, our memory immediately returns, and we think, "Oh, where am
I? What do I have to do?" This is called suptotthita-nyaya. Suppose we die. "Die" means that we become inert for
some time and then again begin our activities. This takes place life after life, according to our karma, or activities,
and svabhava, or nature by association. Now, in the human life, if we prepare ourselves by beginning the activity of
our spiritual life, we return to our real life and attain perfection. Otherwise, according to karma, svabhava, prakrti
and so on, our varieties of life and activity continue, and so also do our birth and death. As explained by
Bhaktivinoda Thakura, mayara vase, yaccha bhese', khaccha habudubu bhai: "My dear brothers, why are you being
washed away by the waves of maya?" One should come to the spiritual platform, and then one's activities will be
permanent. Krta-punya-punjah: this stage is attained after one accumulates the results of pious activities for many,
many lives. Janma-koti-sukrtair na labhyate (Cc. Madhya 8.70). The Krsna consciousness movement wants to stop
koti-janma, repeated birth and death. In one birth, one should rectify everything and come to permanent life. This
is Krsna consciousness.

Vrndavana is the transcendental abode of the Lord, where there is no hunger, anger or thirst. Though naturally
inimical, both human beings and fierce animals live there together in transcendental friendship.
The word vana means "forest." We are afraid of the forest and do not wish to go there, but in Vrndavana the
forest animals are as good as demigods, for they have no envy. Even in this material world, in the forest the animals
live together, and when they go to drink water they do not attack anyone. Envy develops because of sense
gratification, but in Vrndavana there is no sense gratification, for the only aim is Krsna's satisfaction. Even in this
material world, the animals in Vrndavana are not envious of the sadhus who live there. The sadhus keep cows and
supply milk to the tigers, saying, "Come here and take a little milk." Thus envy and malice are unknown in
Vrndavana. That is the difference between Vrndavana and the ordinary world. We are horrified to hear the name of
vana, the forest, but in Vrndavana there is no such horror. Everyone there is happy by pleasing Krsna.
Krsnotkirtana-gana-nartana-parau. Whether a gosvami or a tiger or other ferocious animal, everyone's business is
the same--to please Krsna. Even the tigers are also devotees. This is the specific qualification of Vrndavana. In
Vrndavana everyone is happy. The calf is happy, the cat is happy, the dog is happy, the man is happy--everyone.
Everyone wants to serve Krsna in a different capacity, and thus there is no envy. One may sometimes think that the
monkeys in Vrndavana are envious, because they cause mischief and steal food, but in Vrndavana we find that the
monkeys are allowed to take butter, which Krsna Himself distributes. Krsna personally demonstrates that everyone
has the right to live. This is Vrndavana life. Why should I live and you die? No. That is material life. The
inhabitants of Vrndavana think, "Whatever is given by Krsna, let us divide it as prasada and eat." This mentality
cannot appear all of a sudden, but it will gradually develop with Krsna consciousness; by sadhana, one can come to
this platform.
In the material world one may collect funds all over the world in order to distribute food freely, yet those to
whom the food is given may not even feel appreciative. The value of Krsna consciousness, however, will gradually
be very much appreciated. For instance, in an article about the temple of the Hare Krsna movement in Durban,
South Africa, the Durban Post reported, "All the devotees here are very active in the service of Lord Krsna, and the
results are obvious to see: happiness, good health, peace of mind, and the development of all good qualities." This
is the nature of Vrndavana. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah: without Krsna consciousness, happiness is
impossible; one may struggle, but one cannot have happiness. We are therefore trying to give human society the
opportunity for a life of happiness, good health, peace of mind and all good qualities through God consciousness.

family of cowherd men (another of Krsna's names is Gopala, "He who maintains the cows"); brahma--the Absolute
Truth; advayam--without a second; param--the Supreme; anantam--unlimited; agadha-bodham--possessing
unlimited knowledge; vatsan--the calves; sakhin--and His friends, the boys; iva pura--just as before; paritah--
everywhere; vicinvat--searching; ekam--alone, all by Himself; sa-pani-kavalam--with a morsel of food in His hand;
paramesthi--Lord Brahma; acasta--saw.
Then Lord Brahma saw the Absolute Truth--who is one without a second, who possesses full knowledge and who
is unlimited--assuming the role of a child in a family of cowherd men and standing all alone, just as before, with a
morsel of food in His hand, searching everywhere for the calves and His cowherd friends.
The word agadha-bodham, meaning "full of unlimited knowledge," is significant in this verse. The Lord's
knowledge is unlimited, and therefore one cannot touch where it ends, just as one cannot measure the ocean. What
is the extent of our intelligence in comparison to the vast expanse of water in the ocean? On my passage to
America, how insignificant the ship was, like a matchbox in the midst of the ocean. Krsna's intelligence resembles
the ocean, for one cannot imagine how vast it is. The best course, therefore, is to surrender to Krsna. Don't try to
measure Krsna.
The word advayam, meaning "one without a second," is also significant. Because Brahma was overcast by Krsna's
maya, he was thinking himself the Supreme. In the material world, everyone thinks, "I am the best man in this
world. I know everything." One thinks, "Why should I read Bhagavad-gita? I know everything. I have my own
interpretation." Brahma, however, was able to understand that the Supreme Personality is Krsna. Isvarah paramah
krsnah. Another of Krsna's names, therefore, is paramesvara.
Now Brahma saw Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing as a cowherd boy in Vrndavana, not
demonstrating His opulence but standing just like an innocent boy with some food in His hand, loitering with His
cowherd boyfriends, calves and cows. Brahma did not see Krsna as catur-bhuja, the opulent Narayana; rather, he
simply saw an innocent boy. Nonetheless, he could understand that although Krsna was not demonstrating His
power, He was the same Supreme person. people generally do not appreciate someone unless he shows something
wonderful, but here, although Krsna did not manifest anything wonderful, Brahma could understand that the same
wonderful person was present like an ordinary child, although He was the master of the whole creation. Thus
Brahma prayed, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami: "You are the original person, the cause of everything. I
bow down to You." This was his realization. Tam aham bhajami. This is what is wanted. Vedesu durlabham: one
cannot reach Krsna merely by Vedic knowledge. Adurlabham atma-bhaktau: but when one becomes a devotee,
then one can realize Him. Brahma, therefore, became a devotee. In the beginning he was proud of being Brahma,
the lord of the universe, but now he understood, "Here is the Lord of the universe. I am simply an insignificant
agent. Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami."
Krsna was playing like a dramatic actor. Because Brahma had some false prestige, thinking that he had some
power, Krsna showed him his real position. A similar incident occurred when Brahma went to see Krsna in
Dvaraka. When Krsna's doorman informed Lord Krsna that Lord Brahma had arrived, Krsna responded, "Which
Brahma? Ask him which Brahma." The doorman relayed this question, and Brahma was astonished. "Is there
another Brahma besides me?" he thought. When the doorman informed Lord Krsna, "It is four-headed Brahma,"
Lord Krsna said, "Oh, four-headed. Call others. Show him." This is Krsna's position. For Krsna the four-headed
Brahma is insignificant, to say nothing of "four-headed scientists." Materialistic scientists think that although this
planet earth is full of opulence, all others are vacant. Because they simply speculate, this is their scientific
conclusion. But from the Bhagavatam we understand that the entire universe is full of living entities everywhere.
Thus it is the folly of the scientists that although they do not know anything, they mislead people by presenting
themselves as scientists, philosophers and men of knowledge.

feet; natva--making obeisances; mut-asru-su-jalaih--with the water of his tears of joy; akrta--performed;
abhisekam--the ceremony of bathing His lotus feet.
After seeing this, Lord Brahma hastily got down from his swan carrier, fell down like a golden rod and touched
the lotus feet of Lord Krsna with the tips of the four crowns on his heads. Offering his obeisances, he bathed the
feet of Krsna with the water of his tears of joy.
Lord Brahma bowed down like a stick, and because Lord Brahma's complexion is golden, he appeared to be like a
golden stick lying down before Lord Krsna. When one falls down before a superior just like a stick, one's offering
of obeisances is called dandavat. Danda means "stick," and vat means "like." It is not that one should simply say,
"dandavat." Rather, one must fall down. Thus Brahma fell down, touching his foreheads to the lotus feet of Krsna,
and his crying in ecstasy is to be regarded as an abhiseka bathing ceremony of Krsna's lotus feet.
He who appeared before Brahma as a human child was in fact the Absolute Truth, Parabrahman (brahmeti
paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate). The Supreme Lord is narakrti; that is, He resembles a human being. It is not
that He is four-armed (catur-bahu). Narayana is catur-bahu, but the Supreme Person resembles a human being.
This is also confirmed in the Bible, where it is said that man was made in the image of God.
Lord Brahma saw that Krsna, in His form as a cowherd boy, was Parabrahman, the root cause of everything, but
was now appearing as a human child, loitering in Vrndavana with a morsel of food in His hand. Astonished, Lord
Brahma hastily got down from his swan carrier and let his body fall to the earth. Usually, the demigods never touch
the ground, but Lord Brahma, voluntarily giving up his prestige as a demigod, bowed down on the ground before
Krsna. Although Brahma has one head in each direction, he voluntarily brought all his heads to the ground and
touched Krsna's feet with the tips of his four helmets. Although his intelligence works in every direction, he
surrendered everything before the boy Krsna.
It is mentioned that Brahma washed the feet of Krsna with his tears, and here the word sujalaih indicates that his
tears were purified. As soon as bhakti is present, everything is purified (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam). Therefore
Brahma's crying was a form of bhakty-anubhava, a transformation of transcendental ecstatic love.

he fell and rose as he recalled the wonderful activities of the Lord. After repeating obeisances for a long time,
Brahma stood up and smeared his hands over his eyes. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that the
word locane indicates that with his two hands he wiped the two eyes on each of his four faces. Seeing the Lord
