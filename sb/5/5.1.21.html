<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavan api manuna yathavad upakalpitapacitih priyavrata-naradayor avisamam abhisamiksamanayor
atmasam avasthanam avan-manasam ksayam avyavahrtam pravartayann agamat.
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavan--the most powerful Lord Brahma; api--also; manuna--by Manu; yathavat--as deserved;
upakalpita-apacitih--being worshiped; priyavrata-naradayoh--in the presence of Priyavrata and Narada;
avisamam--without aversion; abhisamiksamanayoh--looking on; atmasam--just suitable for his position;
avasthanam--to his abode; avak-manasam--beyond the description of mind and words; ksayam--the
planet; avyavahrtam--extraordinarily situated; pravartayan--departing; agamat--returned.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma was then worshiped by Manu, who respectfully satisfied him as well as he could.
Priyavrata and Narada also looked upon Brahma with no tinges of resentment. Having engaged Priyavrata
in accepting his father's request, Lord Brahma returned to his abode, Satyaloka, which is indescribable by
the endeavor of mundane mind or words.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Manu was certainly very satisfied that Lord Brahma had persuaded his son Priyavrata to take the
responsibility for ruling the world. Priyavrata and Narada were also very satisfied. Although Brahma had
forced Priyavrata to accept the management of worldly affairs, thus breaking his vow to remain
brahmacari and completely engage in devotional service, Narada and Priyavrata did not look upon
Brahma with resentment. Narada was not at all sorry that he had been frustrated in making Priyavrata a
disciple. Both Priyavrata and Narada were exalted personalities who knew how to respect Lord Brahma.
Therefore instead of looking upon Brahma with resentment, they very feelingly offered him their respect.
Lord Brahma then returned to his celestial abode, known as Satyaloka, which is described here as being
impeccable and being unapproachable by words.
It is stated in this verse that Lord Brahma returned to his residence, which is as important as his own
personality. Lord Brahma is the creator of this universe and the most exalted personality within it. His
lifetime is described in Bhagavad-gita (8.17). Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh. The total
duration of the four yugas is 4,300,000 years, and when that is multiplied a thousand times, it equals
twelve hours in the life of Brahma. Therefore we cannot factually comprehend even twelve hours of
Brahma's life, to say nothing of the one hundred years that constitute his entire lifetime. How, then, can
we understand his abode? The Vedic literatures describe that in Satyaloka there is no birth, death, old age
or disease. In other words, since Satyaloka is situated next to Brahmaloka, or the Brahman effulgence, it is
almost as good as Vaikunthaloka. Lord Brahma's abode is practically indescribable from our present
status. Therefore it has been described as avan-manasa-gocara, or beyond the description of our words
and the imagination of our minds. The Vedic literatures thus describe the abode of Lord Brahma: yad vai
parardhyam tad uparamesthyam na yatra soko na jara na mrtyur nartir na codvegah. "In Satyaloka, which
is situated many millions and billions of years away, there is no lamentation, nor is there old age, death,
anxiety or the influence of enemies."
