<h2>Text</h2>
satyam disaty arthitam arthito nrnam
naivarthado yat punar arthita yatah
svayam vidhatte bhajatam anicchatam
icchapidhanam nija-pada-pallavam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
satyam--certainly; disati--He offers; arthitam--the object prayed for; arthitah--being prayed to; nrnam--
by the human beings; na--not; eva--indeed; artha-dah--the bestower of benedictions; yat--which; punah--
again; arthita--a demand for a benediction; yatah--from which; svayam--personally; vidhatte--He gives;
bhajatam--unto those engaged in His service; anicchatam--although not desiring it; iccha-pidhanam--
which covers all desirable things; nija-pada-pallavam--His own lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead fulfills the material desires of a devotee who approaches Him with
such motives, but He does not bestow benedictions upon the devotee that will cause him to demand more
benedictions again. However, the Lord willingly gives the devotee shelter at His own lotus feet, even
though such a person does not aspire for it, and that shelter satisfies all his desires. That is the Supreme
Personality's special mercy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees mentioned in the previous verse approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead with
material motives, but this verse explains how such devotees are saved from those desires. Srimad-
Bhagavatam (2.3.10) advises:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"Whether one is freed from all material desires, is full of material desires, or desires to become one with
the Supreme, he should engage in devotional service." In this way, not only will the devotee's desires be
fulfilled, but the day will come when he will have no other desire than to serve the lotus feet of the Lord.
One who engages in the service of the Lord with some motive is called a sakama-bhakta, and one who
serves the Lord without any motives is called an akama-bhakta. Krsna is so merciful that He turns a
sakama-bhakta into an akama-bhakta. A pure devotee, an akama-bhakta, who has no material motives, is
satisfied simply to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (6.22). Yam labdhva
caparam labham manyate nadhikam tatah: if one engages in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, he
does not want anything more. This is the highest stage of devotional service. The Lord is so kind even to a
sakama-bhakta, a motivated devotee, that He satisfies his desires in such a way that one day he becomes
an akama-bhakta. Dhruva Maharaja, for example, became a bhakta with the motive of getting a better
kingdom than that of his father, but finally he became an akama-bhakta and said to the Lord, svamin
krtartho'smi varam na yace: "My dear Lord, I am very satisfied simply to serve Your lotus feet. I do not
want any material benefits." Sometimes it is found that a small child eats dirty things, but his parents take
away the dirty things and offer him a sandesa or some other sweetmeat. Devotees who aspire for material
benedictions are compared to such children. The Lord is so kind that He takes away their material desires
and gives them the highest benediction. Therefore, even for material motives, one should not worship
anyone other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead; one must fully engage himself in the devotional
service of the Lord so that all his desires will be fulfilled and at the end he can go back home, back to
Godhead. This is explained in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.37-39, 41) as follows.
Anyakami--a devotee may desire something other than service to the lotus feet of the Lord; yadi kare
krsnera bhajana--but if he engages in Lord Krsna's service; na magiteha krsna tare dena sva-carana--Krsna
gives him shelter at His lotus feet, even though he does not aspire for it. Krsna kahe--the Lord says; ama
bhaje--"He is engaged in My service"; mage visaya-sukha--"but he wants the benefits of material sense
gratification." Amrta chadi' visa mage:--"such a devotee is like a person who asks for poison instead of
nectar." Ei bada murkha: "That is his foolishness." Ami-vijna: "But I am experienced." Ei murkhe 'visaya'
kene diba: "Why should I give such a foolish person the dirty things of material enjoyment?" Sva-caranamrta:
"It would be better for Me to give him shelter at My lotus feet." 'Visaya' bhulaiba: "I shall cause him
to forget all material desires." Kama lagi' krsna bhaje--if one engages in the service of the Lord for sense
gratification; paya krsna-rase--the result is that he ultimately gets a taste for serving the lotus feet of the
Lord. Kama chadi' 'da' haite haya abhilase: He then gives up all material desires and wants to become an
eternal servant of the Lord.
