<h2>Text</h2>
ko va iha te 'parajito 'parajitaya mayayanavasita-padavyanavrta-matir visaya-visa-rayanavrta-prakrtir
anupasita-mahac-caranah.
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kah va--who is that person; iha--within this material world; te--of Your Lordship; aparajitah--not
conquered; aparajitaya--by the unconquerable; mayaya--illusory energy; anavasita-padavya--whose path
cannot be ascertained; anavrta-matih--whose intelligence is not bewildered; visaya-visa--of material
enjoyment, which is like poison; raya--by the course; anavrta--not covered; prakrtih--whose nature;
anupasita--without worshiping; mahat-caranah--the lotus feet of great devotees.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, unless one worships the lotus feet of great devotees, one will be conquered by the illusory
energy, and his intelligence will be bewildered. Indeed, who has not been carried away by the waves of
material enjoyment, which are like poison? Your illusory energy is unconquerable. No one can see the
path of this material energy or tell how it is working.
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Nabhi was inclined to performing great sacrifices for begetting a son. The son might be as
good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but such a material desire--be it great or insignificant--is
brought about by the influence of maya. A devotee does not at all desire anything for sense gratification.
Devotion is therefore explained as devoid of material desires (anyabhilasita-sunya). Everyone is subjected
to the influence of maya and entangled in all kinds of material desire, and Maharaja Nabhi was no
exception. Freedom from maya's influence is possible when one engages in the service of the great
devotees (mahac-carana-seva). Without worshiping the lotus feet of a great devotee, one cannot be freed
from maya's influence. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara
payeche keba: "Who has been freed from maya's clutches without serving the lotus feet of a Vaisnava?"
Maya is aparajita, and her influence is also aparajita. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome."
Only a devotee can surpass maya's great influence. It was no fault on Maharaja Nabhi's part that he
wanted a son. He wanted a son like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the best of all sons. By
the association of the Lord's devotee, one no longer desires material opulence. This is confirmed in
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.54):
"sadhu-sanga", "sadhu-sanga" sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya
and Madhya 22.51:
mahat-krpa vina kona karme 'bhakti' naya
krsna-bhakti dure rahu, samsara nahe ksaya
If one is serious about escaping maya's influence and returning home, back to Godhead, one must
associate with a sadhu (devotee). That is the verdict of all scriptures. By the slight association of a
devotee, one can be freed from the clutches of maya. Without the mercy of the pure devotee, one cannot
get freedom by any means. Certainly a pure devotee's association is necessary in order to obtain the loving
service of the Lord. One cannot be freed from maya's clutches without sadhu-sanga, the benediction of a
great devotee. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.32) Prahlada Maharaja says:
naisam matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo-'bhisekam
niskincananam na vrnita yavat
One cannot become the Lord's pure devotee without taking the dust of a great devotee on his head
(pada-rajo-'bhisekam). A pure devotee is niskincana; he has no material desire to enjoy the material
world. One has to take shelter of such a pure devotee in order to attain his qualities. The pure devotee is
always free from the clutches of maya and her influence.
