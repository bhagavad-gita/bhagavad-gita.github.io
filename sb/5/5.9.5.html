<h2>Translation</h2>
King Rahugana could understand the speeches given by the carriers, who were afraid of being punished.
He could also understand that simply due to the fault of one person, the palanquin was not being carried
properly. Knowing this perfectly well and hearing their appeal, he became a little angry, although he was
very advanced in political science and was very experienced. His anger arose due to his inborn nature as a
king. Actually King Rahugana's mind was covered by the mode of passion, and he therefore spoke as
follows to Jada Bharata, whose Brahman effulgence was not clearly visible, being covered like a fire
covered by ashes.
<h2>Purport</h2>
The distinction between rajo-guna and sattva-guna is explained in this verse. Although the King was
very upright and advanced in political science and governmental management, he was nonetheless in the
mode of passion, and therefore, due to a slight agitation, he became angry. Jada Bharata, despite all kinds
of injustice endured because of his deaf and dumb display, remained silent by the strength of his spiritual
advancement. Nonetheless his brahma-tejah, his Brahman effulgence, was indistinctly visible in his
person.
