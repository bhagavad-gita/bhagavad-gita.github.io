<h2>Translation</h2>
The residents of the material world who enjoy the products of these flowing rivers have no wrinkles on
their bodies and no grey hair. They never feel fatigue, and perspiration does not give their bodies a bad
odor. They are not afflicted by old age, disease or untimely death, they do not suffer from chilly cold or
scorching heat, nor do their bodies lose their luster. They all live very happily, without anxieties, until
death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse hints at the perfection of human society even within this material world. The miserable
conditions of this material world can be corrected by a sufficient supply of milk, yogurt, honey, ghee,
molasses, food grains, ornaments, bedding, sitting places and so on. This is human civilization. Ample
food grains can be produced through agricultural enterprises, and profuse supplies of milk, yogurt and
ghee can be arranged through cow protection. Abundant honey can be obtained if the forests are
protected. Unfortunately, in modern civilization, men are busy killing the cows that are the source of
yogurt, milk and ghee, they are cutting down all the trees that supply honey, and they are opening
factories to manufacture nuts, bolts, automobiles and wine instead of engaging in agriculture. How can
the people be happy? They must suffer from all the misery of materialism. Their bodies become wrinkled
and gradually deteriorate until they become almost like dwarves, and a bad odor emanates from their
bodies because of unclean perspiration resulting from eating all kinds of nasty things. This is not human
civilization. If people actually want happiness in this life and want to prepare for the best in the next life,
they must adopt a Vedic civilization. In a Vedic civilization, there is a full supply of all the necessities
mentioned above.
