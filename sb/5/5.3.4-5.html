<h2>Translation</h2>
The priests began to offer prayers to the Lord, saying: O most worshipable one, we are simply Your
servants. Although You are full in Yourself, please, out of Your causeless mercy, accept a little service
from us, Your eternal servants. We are not actually aware of Your transcendental form, but we can simply
offer our respectful obeisances again and again, as instructed by the Vedic literatures and authorized
acaryas. Materialistic living entities are very much attracted to the modes of material nature, and therefore
they are never perfect, but You are above the jurisdiction of all material conceptions. Your name, form
and qualities are all transcendental and beyond the conception of experimental knowledge. Indeed, who
can conceive of You? In the material world we can perceive only material names and qualities. We have
no other power than to offer our respectful obeisances and prayers unto You, the transcendental person.
The chanting of Your auspicious transcendental qualities will wipe out the sins of all mankind. That is the
most auspicious activity for us, and we can thus partially understand Your supernatural position.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do with material perception. Even the
impersonalist Sankaracarya says. narayanah paro 'vyaktat: "Narayana. the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is beyond the material conception." We cannot concoct the form and attributes of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. We must simply accept the description given in Vedic literatures about the Lord's
form and activities. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.29):
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksalaksavrtesu
surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all
desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always
served with great reverence and affection by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune." We can
have some conception of the Absolute Truth, His form and His attributes simply by reading the
descriptions given in Vedic literatures and authoritative statements given by exalted personalities like
Brahma, Narada, Sukadeva Gosvami and others. Srila Rupa Gosvami says, atah sri-krsna-namadi na
bhaved grahyam indriyaih: "We cannot conceive the name, form and qualities of Sri Krsna through our
material senses." Because of this, other names for the Lord are adhoksaja and aprakrta, which indicate that
He is beyond any material senses. Out of His causeless mercy upon His devotees, the Lord appeared
before Maharaja Nabhi. Similarly, when we are engaged in the Lord's devotional service, the Lord reveals
Himself to us. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah. This is the only way to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas
casmi tattvatah: one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service.
There is no other way. We have to hear from the authorities and from the sastras and consider the
Supreme Lord in terms of their statements. We cannot imagine or concoct forms and attributes of the
Lord.
