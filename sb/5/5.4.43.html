TRANSLATION
This Bhagavata Purana is as brilliant as the sun, and it has arisen just after the departure of Lord Krsna
to His own abode, accompanied by religion, knowledge, etc. Persons who have lost their vision due to the
dense darkness of ignorance in the age of Kali shall get light from this Purana.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna has His eternal dhama, or abode, where He eternally enjoys Himself with His eternal
associates and paraphernalia. And His eternal abode is a manifestation of His internal energy, whereas the
material world is a manifestation of His external energy. When He descends on the material world, He
displays Himself with all paraphernalia in His internal potency, which is called atma-maya. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He descends by His own potency (atma-maya). His form, name, fame,
paraphernalia, abode, etc., are not, therefore, creations of matter. He descends to reclaim the fallen souls
and to reestablish codes of religion which are directly enacted by Him. Except for God, no one can
establish the principles of religion. Either He or a suitable person empowered by Him can dictate the
codes of religion. Real religion means to know God, our relation with Him and our duties in relation with
Him and to know ultimately our destination after leaving this material body. The conditioned souls, who
are entrapped by the material energy, hardly know all these principles of life. Most of them are like
animals engaged in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. They are mostly engaged in sense enjoyment
under the pretension of religiosity, knowledge or salvation. They are still more blind in the present age of
quarrel, or Kali-yuga. In the Kali-yuga the population is just a royal edition of the animals. They have
nothing to do with spiritual knowledge or godly religious life. They are so blind that they cannot see
anything beyond the jurisdiction of the subtle mind, intelligence or ego, but they are very much proud of
their advancement in knowledge, science and material prosperity. They can risk their lives to become a
dog or hog just after leaving the present body, for they have completely lost sight of the ultimate aim of
life. The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna appeared before us just a little prior to the beginning of Kaliyuga,
and He returned to His eternal home practically at the commencement of Kali-yuga. While He was
present, He exhibited everything by His different activities. He spoke the Bhagavad-gita specifically and
eradicated all pretentious principles of religiosity. And prior to His departure from this material world, He
empowered Sri Vyasadeva through Narada to compile the messages of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and thus
both the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-Bhagavatam are like torchbearers for the blind people of this age.
In other words, if men in this age of Kali want to see the real light of life, they must take to these two
books only, and their aim of life will be fulfilled. Bhagavad-gita is the preliminary study of the
Bhagavatam. And Srimad-Bhagavatam is the summum bonum of life, Lord Sri Krsna personified. We must
therefore accept Srimad-Bhagavatam as the direct representation of Lord Krsna. One who can see Srimad-
Bhagavatam can see also Lord Sri Krsna in person. They are identical.
