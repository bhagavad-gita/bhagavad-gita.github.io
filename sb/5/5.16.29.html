tam anuparito loka-palanam astanam yatha-disam yatha-rupam turiya-manena puro 'stav upaklptah.
SYNONYMS
tam--that great township named Brahmapuri; anuparitah--surrounding; loka-palanam--of the governors
of the planets; astanam--eight; yatha-disam--according to the directions; yatha-rupam--in exact
conformity with the township of Brahmapuri; turiya-manena--by measurement only one fourth; purah--
townships; astau--eight; upaklptah--situated.
TRANSLATION
Surrounding Brahmapuri in all directions are the residences of the eight principal governors of the
planetary systems, beginning with King Indra. These abodes are similar to Brahmapuri but are one fourth
the size.
PURPORT
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura confirms that the townships of Lord Brahma and the eight
subordinate governors of the planetary systems, beginning with Indra, are mentioned in other Puranas.
merau nava-purani syur
manovaty amaravati
tejovati samyamani
tatha krsnangana para
sraddhavati gandhavati
tatha canya mahodaya
yasovati ca brahmendra
bahyadinam yatha-kramam
Brahma's township is known as Manovati, and those of his assistants such as Indra and Agni are known
as Amaravati, Tejovati, Samyamani, Krsnangana, Sraddhavati, Gandhavati, Mahodaya and Yasovati.
Brahmapuri is situated in the middle, and the other eight puris surround it in all directions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "A Description of Jambudvipa."
Chapter Seventeen
The Descent of the River Ganges
The Seventeenth Chapter describes the origin of the Ganges River and how it flows in and around
Ilavrta-varsa. There is also a description of the prayers Lord Siva offers to Lord Sankarsana, part of the
quadruple expansions of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Lord Visnu once approached Bali Maharaja
while the King was performing a sacrifice. The Lord appeared before him as Trivikrama, or Vamana, and
begged alms from the King in the form of three steps of land. With two steps, Lord Vamana covered all
three planetary systems and pierced the covering of the universe with the toes of His left foot. A few drops
of water from the Causal Ocean leaked through this hole and fell on the head of Lord Siva, where they
remained for one thousand millenniums. These drops of water are the sacred Ganges River. It first flows
onto the heavenly planets, which are located on the soles of Lord Visnu's feet. The Ganges River is known
by many names, such as the Bhagirathi and the Jahnavi. It purifies Dhruvaloka and the planets of the
seven sages because both Dhruva and the sages have no other desire than to serve the Lord's lotus feet.
The Ganges River, emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord, inundates the heavenly planets, especially
the moon, and then flows through Brahmapuri atop Mount Meru. Here the river divides into four
branches (known as Sita, Alakananda, Caksu and Bhadra), which then flow down to the ocean of salt
water. The branch known as Sita flows through Sekhara-parvata and Gandhamadana-parvata and then
flows down to Bhadrasva-varsa, where it mixes with the ocean of salt water in the West. The Caksu
branch flows through Malyavan-giri and, after reaching Ketumala-varsa, mixes with the ocean of salt
water in the West. The branch known as Bhadra flows onto Mount Meru, Mount Kumuda, and the Nila,
Sveta and Srngavan mountains before it reaches Kuru-desa, where it flows into the ocean of salt water in
the north. The Alakananda branch flows through Brahmalaya, crosses over many mountains, including
Hemakuta and Himakuta, and then reaches Bharata-varsa, where it flows into the southern side of the
ocean of salt water. Many other rivers and their branches flow through the nine varsas.
The tract of land known as Bharata-varsa is the field of activities, and the other eight varsas are for
persons who are meant to enjoy heavenly comfort. In each of these eight beautiful provinces, the celestial
denizens enjoy various standards of material comfort and pleasure. A different incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead distributes His mercy in each of the nine varsas of Jambudvipa.
In the Ilavrta-varsa, Lord Siva is the only male. There he lives with his wife, Bhavani, who is attended by
many maidservants. If any other male enters that province, Bhavani curses him to become a woman. Lord
Siva worships Lord Sankarsana by offering various prayers, one of which is as follows: "My dear Lord,
please liberate all Your devotees from material life and bind all the nondevotees to the material world.
Without Your mercy, no one can be released from the bondage of material existence."
