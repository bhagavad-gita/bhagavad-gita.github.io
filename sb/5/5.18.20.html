<h2>Translation</h2>
After many, many births, when the results of one's pious activities mature, one gets an opportunity to
associate with pure devotees. Then one is able to cut the knot of bondage to ignorance, which bound him
because of varied fruitive activities. As a result of associating with devotees, one gradually renders service
to Lord Vasudeva, who is transcendental, free from attachment to the material world, beyond the mind
and words, and independent of everything else. That bhakti-yoga, devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, is
the real path of liberation.
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahman realization is the beginning of liberation, and Paramatma realization is still further
advancement toward the realm of liberation, but one achieves real liberation when he understands his
position as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (muktir hitvanyatha rupam
svarupena vyavasthitih). In the material world, in the bodily concept of life, everyone is working in the
wrong direction. When one becomes brahma-bhuta, spiritually realized, one understands that he is not
the body and that working in the bodily concept of life is useless and misdirected. Then his devotional
service begins. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful. He
never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he
attains pure devotional service unto Me." Devotional service is actual liberation. When one is attracted by
the beauty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and his mind is always engaged at the Lord's lotus feet,
he is no longer interested in subjects that do not help him in self-realization. In other words, he loses all
attraction for material activities. In the Taittiriya Upanisad (2.7) it is said: esa hy evanandayati. yada hy
evaisa etasmin na drsye 'natmye anirukte 'nilayane 'bhayam pratistham vindate 'tha so 'bhayam gato
bhavati. A living entity becomes established in spiritual, blissful life when he fully understands that his
happiness depends on spiritual self-realization, which is the basic principle of ananda (bliss), and when he
is eternally situated in the service of the Lord, who has no other lord above Him.
