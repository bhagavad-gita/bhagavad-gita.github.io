<h2>Text</h2>
muktas tato yadi bandhad devadatta upacchinatti tasmad api visnumitra ity anavasthitih.
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
muktah--liberated; tatah--from that; yadi--if; bandhat--from the government imprisonment or being
beaten by the protector of the woman; deva-dattah--person named Devadatta; upacchinatti--takes the
money from him; tasmat--from the person named Devadatta; api--again; visnu-mitrah--a person named
Visnumitra; iti--thus; anavasthitih--the riches do not stay in one place but pass from one hand to another.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Stealing or cheating another person out of his money, the conditioned soul somehow or other keeps it
in his possession and escapes punishment. Then another man, named Devadatta, cheats him and takes the
money away. Similarly, another man, named Visnumitra, steals the money from Devadatta and takes it
away. In any case, the money does not stay in one place. It passes from one hand to another. Ultimately
no one can enjoy the money, and it remains the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<h2>Purport</h2>
Riches come from Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, and the goddess of fortune is the property of
Narayana, the Supreme personality of Godhead. The goddess of fortune cannot stay anywhere but by the
side of Narayana; therefore another of her names is Cancala, restless. She cannot be peaceful unless she is
in the company of her husband, Narayana. For example, Laksmi was carried away by the materialistic
Ravana. Ravana kidnapped Sita, the goddess of fortune belonging to Lord Rama. As a result, Ravana's
entire family, opulence and kingdom were smashed, and Sita, the goddess of fortune, was recovered from
his clutches and reunited with Lord Rama. Thus all property, riches and wealth belong to Krsna. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the true beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, and He is
the supreme proprietor of all the planetary systems."
Foolish materialistic people collect money and steal from other thieves. but they cannot keep it. In any
case, it must be spent. One person cheats another, and another person cheats someone else; therefore the
best way to possess Laksmi is to keep her by the side of Narayana. This is the point of the Krsna
consciousness movement. We worship Laksmi (Radharani) along with Narayana (Krsna). We collect
money from various sources, but that money does not belong to anyone but Radha and Krsna (Laksmi-
Narayana). If money is utilized in the service of Laksmi-Narayana, the devotee automatically lives in an
opulent way. However, if one wants to enjoy Laksmi the way Ravana did, he will be vanquished by the
laws of nature, and whatever few possessions he has will be taken away. Finally death will take everything
away, and death is the representative of Krsna.
