<h2>Translation</h2>
Svayambhuva Manu, with the assistance of Lord Brahma, thus fulfilled his desires. With the permission
of the great sage Narada, he delivered to his son the governmental responsibility for maintaining and
protecting all the planets of the universe. He thus achieved relief from the most dangerous, poisonous
ocean of material desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Svayambhuva Manu was practically hopeless because such a great personality as Narada was instructing
his son Priyavrata not to accept household life. Now he was very pleased that Lord Brahma had interfered
by inducing his son to accept the responsibility for ruling the government of the universe. From
Bhagavad-gita we get information that Vaivasvata Manu was the son of the sun-god and that his son,
Maharaja Iksvaku, ruled this planet earth. Svayambhuva Manu, however, appears to have been in charge
of the entire universe, and he entrusted to his son, Maharaja Priyavrata, the responsibility for maintaining
and protecting all the planetary systems. Dhara-mandala means "planet." This earth, for instance, is called
dhara-mandala. Akhila, however, means "all" or "universal." It is therefore difficult to understand where
Maharaja Priyavrata was situated, but from this literature his position certainly appears greater than that
of Vaivasvata Manu, for he was entrusted with all the planetary systems of the entire universe.
Another significant statement is that Svayambhuva Manu took great satisfaction from abnegating the
responsibility for ruling all the planetary systems of the universe. At present, politicians are very eager to
take charge of the government, and they engage their men in canvassing from door to door to get votes to
win the post of president or a similar exalted office. On the contrary, however, herein we find that King
Priyavrata had to be persuaded by Lord Brahma to accept the post of emperor of the entire universe.
Similarly, his father, Svayambhuva Manu, felt relieved to entrust the universal government to Priyavrata.
Thus it is evident that the kings and executive heads of government in the Vedic age never accepted their
positions for sense enjoyment. Such exalted kings, who were known as rajarsis, ruled only to maintain
and protect the kingdom for the welfare of the citizens. The history of Priyavrata and Svayambhuva Manu
describes how exemplary, responsible monarchs performed the duties of government with disinterest,
keeping themselves always aloof from the contamination of material attachment.
Material affairs have herein been compared to an ocean of poison. They have been described in a similar
way by Srila Narottama dasa Thakura in one of his songs:
samsara-visanale, diva-nisi hiya jvale,
judaite na kainu upaya
"My heart is always burning in the fire of material existence. and I have made no provisions for getting
out of it."
golokera prema-dhana, hari-nama-sankirtana,
rati na janmila kene taya
"The only remedy is hari-nama-sankirtana, the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, which is
imported from the spiritual world, Goloka Vrndavana. How unfortunate I am that I have no attraction for
this." Manu wanted to seek shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore when his son Priyavrata
took charge of his worldly affairs, Manu was very relieved. That is the system of Vedic civilization. At the
end of life, one must free himself from worldly affairs and completely engage in the service of the Lord.
The word surarsi-vara-anumatena is also significant. Manu entrusted the government to his son with the
permission of the great saint Narada. This is particularly mentioned because although Narada wanted
Priyavrata to become free from all material affairs, when Priyavrata took charge of the universe by the
request of Lord Brahma and Manu, Narada was also very pleased.
