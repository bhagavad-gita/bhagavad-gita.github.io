<h2>Text</h2>
tatrayam slokah----

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--in that connection; ayam slokah--there is this famous verse; praiyavratam--coming from King
Priyavrata; vamsam--the dynasty; imam--this; virajah--King Viraja; carama-udbhavah--the source of one
hundred sons (headed by Satajit); akarot--decorated; ati-alam--very greatly; kirtya--by his reputation;
visnuh--Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sura-ganam--the demigods; yatha--just as.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There is a famous verse about King Viraja. "Because of his high qualities and wide fame, King Viraja
became the jewel of the dynasty of King Priyavrata, just as Lord Visnu, by His transcendental potency,
decorates and blesses the demigods."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Within a garden, a flowering tree attains a good reputation because of its fragrant flowers. Similarly, if
there is a famous man in a family, he is compared to a fragrant flower in a forest. Because of him, an entire
family can become famous in history. Because Lord Krsna took birth in the Yadu dynasty, the Yadu
dynasty and the Yadavas have remained famous for all time. Because of King Viraja's appearance, the
family of Maharaja Priyavrata has remained famous for all time.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
"The Glories of the Descendants of King Priyavrata."
Chapter Sixteen
A Description of Jambudvipa
While describing the character of Maharaja Priyavrata and his descendants, Sukadeva Gosvami also
described Meru Mountain and the planetary system known as Bhu-mandala. Bhu-mandala is like a lotus
flower, and its seven islands are compared to the whorl of the lotus. The place known as Jambudvipa is in
the middle of that whorl. In Jambudvipa there is a mountain known as Sumeru, which is made of solid
gold. The height of this mountain is 84,000 yojanas, of which 16,000 yojanas are below the earth. Its
width is estimated to be 32,000 yojanas at its summit and 16,000 yojanas at its foot. (One yojana equals
approximately eight miles.) This king of mountains, Sumeru, is the support of the planet earth.
On the southern side of the land known as Ilavrta-varsa are the mountains known as Himavan,
Hemakuta and Nisadha, and on the northern side are the mountains Nila, Sveta and Srnga. Similarly, on
the eastern and western side there are Malyavan and Gandhamadana, two large mountains. Surrounding
Sumeru Mountain are four mountains known as Mandara, Merumandara, Suparsva and Kumuda, each
10,000 yojanas long and 10,000 yojanas high. On these four mountains there are trees a banyan tree.
There are also lakes full of milk, honey, sugarcane juice and pure water. These lakes can fulfill all desires.
There are also gardens named Nandana, Citraratha, Vaibhrajaka and Sarvatobhadra. On the side of
Suparsva Mountain is a kadamba tree with streams of honey flowing from its hollows, and on Kumuda
Mountain there is a banyan tree named Satavalsa, from whose roots flow rivers containing milk, yogurt
and many other desirable things. Surrounding Sumeru Mountain like filaments of the whorl of a lotus are
twenty mountain ranges such as Kuranga, Kurara, Kusumbha, Vaikanka and Trikuta. To the east of
Sumeru are the mountains Jathara and Devakuta, to the west are Pavana and Pariyatra, to the south are
Kailasa and Karavira, and to the north are Trisrnga and Makara. These eight mountains are about 18,000
yojanas long, 2,000 yojanas wide and 2,000 yojanas high. On the summit of Mount Sumeru is
Brahmapuri, the residence of Lord Brahma. Each of its four sides is 10,000 yojanas long. Surrounding
Brahmapuri are the cities of King Indra and seven other demigods. These cities are one fourth the size of
Brahmapuri.
