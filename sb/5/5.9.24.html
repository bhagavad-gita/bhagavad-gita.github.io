<h2>Text</h2>
tan me bhavan nara-devabhimanamadena
tucchikrta-sattamasya
krsista maitri-drsam arta-bandho
yatha tare sad-avadhyanam amhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; me--unto me; bhavan--your good self; nara-deva-abhimana-madena--by madness due to
having the body of a king and thus being proud of it; tucchikrta--who has insulted; sat-tamasya--you who
are the best among human beings; krsista--kindly show; maitri-drsam--your causeless mercy upon me like
a friend; arta-bandho--O friend of all distressed persons; yatha--so; tare--I can get relief from; satavadhyanam--
neglecting a great personality like you; amhah--the sin.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Whatever you have spoken appears to me to be contradictory. O best friend of the distressed, I have
committed a great offense by insulting you. I was puffed up with false prestige due to possessing the body
of a king. For this I have certainly become an offender. Therefore I pray that you kindly glance at me with
your causeless mercy. If you do so, I can be relieved from sinful activities brought about by insulting you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said that by offending a Vaisnava, one finishes all his spiritual activities.
Offending a Vaisnava is considered the mad elephant offense. A mad elephant can destroy an entire
garden which has been developed with great labor. One may attain the topmost platform of devotional
service, but somehow or other if he offends a Vaisnava, the whole structure collapses. Unconsciously,
King Rahugana offended Jada Bharata, but due to his good sense, he asked to be excused. This is the
process by which one can be relieved from a vaisnava-aparadha. Krsna is always very simple and by nature
merciful. When one commits an offense at the feet of a Vaisnava, one must immediately apologize to such
a personality so that his spiritual advancement may not be hampered.
