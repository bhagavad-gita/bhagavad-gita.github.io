<h2>Translation</h2>
The King thus began criticizing himself: Alas, how condemned I have become because of my sense
gratification! I have now fallen into material enjoyment, which is exactly like a covered well. I have had
enough! I am not going to enjoy any more. Just see how I have become like a dancing monkey in the
hands of my wife. Because of this, I am condemned.
PURPORT
How condemned is the advancement of material knowledge can be understood from the behavior of
Maharaja Priyavrata. He performed such wonderful acts as creating another sun, which shined during the
night, and creating a chariot so great that its wheels formed vast oceans. These activities are so great that
modern scientists cannot even imagine how such things can be done. Maharaja Priyavrata acted very
wonderfully in the material field of activities, but because he was dealing in sense gratification--ruling his
kingdom and dancing to the indications of his beautiful wife--he personally condemned himself. When
we think about this example of Maharaja Priyavrata, we can just consider how degraded is the modern
civilization of materialistic advancement. Modern so-called scientists and other materialists are very
satisfied because they can construct great bridges, roads and machines, but such activities are nothing
comparable to those of Maharaja Priyavrata. If Maharaja Priyavrata could condemn himself in spite of his
wonderful activities, how condemned we are in our so-called advancement of material civilization. We
can conclude that such advancement has nothing to do with the problems of the living entity entangled
within this material world. Unfortunately, modern man does not understand his entanglement and how
condemned he is, nor does he know what kind of body he is going to have in the next life. From a
spiritual point of view, a great kingdom, beautiful wife and wonderful material activities are all
impediments to spiritual advancement. Maharaja Priyavrata had served the great sage Narada sincerely.
Therefore even though he had accepted material opulences, he could not be deviated from his own task.
He again became Krsna conscious. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita:
nehabhikrama-naso 'sti
pratyavayo na vidyate
svalpam apy asya dharmasya
trayate mahato bhayat
"In devotional service there is no loss or diminution, and even a small service rendered in devotional life
is sufficient to save one from the greatest danger." (Bg. 2.40) Such renunciation as Maharaja Priyavrata's is
possible only by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally when people are powerful or
when they have a beautiful wife, a beautiful home and material popularity, they become more and more
entangled. Priyavrata Maharaja, however, having been completely trained by the great sage Narada,
revived his Krsna consciousness in spite of all impediments.
