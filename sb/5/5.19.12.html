TRANSLATION
Narada, the most powerful saintly sage, also worships Nara-Narayana by chanting the following mantra:
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this
visible cosmic manifestation, yet He is completely free from false prestige. Although to the foolish He
appears to have accepted a material body like us, He is unaffected by bodily tribulations like hunger, thirst
and fatigue. Although He is the witness who sees everything, His senses are unpolluted by the objects He
sees. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that unattached, pure witness of the world, the Supreme
Soul, the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the body of
eternity, transcendental bliss and full knowledge. Now in this verse He is more fully described. Krsna is
the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation, yet He is unattached to it. If we were to construct a very tall
skyscraper, we would be very attached to it, but Krsna is so renounced that although He has created
everything, He is not attached to anything (na badhyate). Furthermore, although Krsna has His
transcendental form, sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, He is not disturbed by the bodily necessities of life, which
are called daihika; for example, He is never hungry, thirsty or fatigued (na hanyate deha-gato 'pi
daihikaih). Then again, since everything is Krsna's property, He sees everything and is present
everywhere, but because His body is transcendental, He is above vision, the objects of vision and the
process of vision. When we see someone beautiful, we are attracted. The sight of a beautiful woman
immediately attracts a man, and the sight of a man naturally attracts a woman. Krsna, however, is
transcendental to all these faults. Although He is the seer of everything, He is not afflicted with faulty
vision (na drg yasya gunair vidusyate). Therefore, although He is the witness and seer, He is aloof from all
affection for the activities He sees. He is always unattached and separate; He is only a witness.
