TRANSLATION
The great rsi Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, there is no limit to the expansion of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead's material energy. This material world is a transformation of the material qualities
[sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna], yet no one could possibly explain it perfectly, even in a lifetime
as long as that of Brahma No one in the material world is perfect, and an imperfect person could not
describe this material universe accurately, even after continued speculation. O King, I shall nevertheless
try to explain to you the principal regions, such as Bhu-goloka [Bhuloka], with their names, forms,
measurements and various symptoms.
PURPORT
The material world is only one fourth of the Supreme personality of Godhead's creation, but it is
unlimited and impossible for anyone to know or describe, even with the qualification of a life as long as
that of Brahma, who lives for millions and millions of years. Modern scientists and astronomers try to
explain the cosmic situation and the vastness of space, and some of them believe that all the glittering
stars are different suns. From Bhagavad-gita, however, we understand that all these stars (naksatras) are
like the moon, in that they reflect the sunshine. They are not independent luminaries. Bhuloka is
explained to be that portion of outer space through which the heat and light of the sun extend. Therefore
it is natural to conclude that this universe extends in space as far as we can see and encompasses the
glittering stars. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami admitted that to give full details of this expansive material
universe would be impossible, but nevertheless he wanted to give the King as much knowledge as he had
received through the parampara system. We should conclude that if one cannot comprehend the material
expansions of the Supreme personality of Godhead, one certainly cannot estimate the expansiveness of
the spiritual world. The Brahma-samhita (5.33) confirms this:
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
The limits of the expansions of Govinda, the Supreme personality of Godhead, cannot be estimated by
anyone, even a person as perfect as Brahma, not to speak of tiny scientists whose senses and instruments
are all imperfect and who cannot give us information of even this one universe. We should therefore be
satisfied with the information obtainable from Vedic sources as spoken by authorities like Sukadeva
Gosvami.
