<h2>Translation</h2>
After perceiving the moonshine, Maharaja Bharata continued speaking like a crazy person. He said: The
deer's son was so submissive and dear to me that due to its separation I am feeling separation from my
own son. Due to the burning fever of this separation, I am suffering as if inflamed by a forest fire. My
heart, which is like the lily of the land, is now burning. Seeing me so distressed, the moon is certainly
splashing its shining nectar upon me--just as a friend throws water on another friend who has a high
fever. In this way, the moon is bringing me happiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Ayur-vedic treatment, it is said that if one has a high fever, someone should splash him
with water after gargling this water. In this way the fever subsides. Although Bharata Maharaja was very
aggrieved due to the separation of his so-called son, the deer, he thought that the moon was splashing
gargled water on him from its mouth and that this water would subdue his high fever, which was raging
due to separation from the deer.
