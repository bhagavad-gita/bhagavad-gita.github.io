<h2>Translation</h2>
In India [Bharata-varsa], there are many worshipers of the demigods, the various officials appointed by
the Supreme Lord, such as Indra, Candra and Surya, all of whom are worshiped differently. The
worshipers offer the demigods their oblations, considering the demigods part and parcel of the whole, the
Supreme Lord. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts these offerings and gradually raises
the worshipers to the real standard of devotional service by fulfilling their desires and aspirations. Because
the Lord is complete, He offers the worshipers the benedictions they desire even if they worship only part
of His transcendental body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (9.13) Lord Krsna says:
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible." Mahatma, advanced devotees, worship only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Others, however, who are also sometimes called mahatmas, worship the Lord as
ekatvena prthaktvena. In other words, they accept the demigods as different parts of Krsna and worship
them for various benedictions. Although the devotees of the demigods thus achieve the desired results
offered by Krsna, they have been described in Bhagavad-gita as hrta jnana, not very intelligent. Krsna does
not desire to be worshiped indirectly through the different parts of His body; Krsna wants direct
devotional worship. Therefore a devotee who directly worships Lord Krsna through staunch devotional
service, as recommended in Srimad-Bhagavatam, (tivrena bhakti-yogena yajeta purusam param), is very
quickly elevated to the transcendental position. Nevertheless, devotees who worship the demigods, the
different parts of the Lord, receive the benedictions they desire because the Lord is the original master of
all benedictions. If anyone wants a particular benediction, for the Lord to award it is not at all difficult.
