TRANSLATION
King Gaya gave full protection and security to the citizens so that their personal property would not be
disturbed by undesirable elements. He also saw that there was sufficient food to feed all the citizens. [This
is called posana.] He would sometimes distribute gifts to the citizens to satisfy them. [This is called
prinana.] He would sometimes call meetings and satisfy the citizens with sweet words. [This is called
upalalana.] He would also give them good instructions on how to become first-class citizens. [This is
called anusasana.] Such were the characteristics of King Gaya's royal order. Besides all this, King Gaya
was a householder who strictly observed the rules and regulations of household life. He performed
sacrifices and was an unalloyed pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was called
Mahapurusa because as a king he gave the citizens all facilities, and as a householder he executed all his
duties so that at the end he became a strict devotee of the Supreme Lord. As a devotee, he was always
ready to give respect to other devotees and to engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is the
bhakti-yoga process. Due to all these transcendental activities, King Gaya was always free from the bodily
conception. He was full in Brahman realization, and consequently he was always jubilant. He did not
experience material lamentation. Although he was perfect in all respects, he was not proud, nor was he
anxious to rule the kingdom.
PURPORT
As Lord Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita, when He descends on earth, He has two types of business--to
give protection to the faithful and annihilate the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam).
Since the king is the representative of the Supreme personality of Godhead, he is sometimes called naradeva,
that is, the Lord as a human being. According to the Vedic injunctions, he is worshiped as God on
the material platform. As a representative of the Supreme Lord, the king had the duty to protect the
citizens in a perfect way so that they would not be anxious for food and protection and so that they would
be jubilant. The king would supply everything for their benefit, and because of this he would levy taxes. If
the king or government otherwise levies taxes on the citizens, he becomes responsible for the sinful
activities of the citizens. In Kali-yuga, monarchy is abolished because the kings themselves are subjected
to the influence of Kali-yuga. It is understood from the Ramayana that when Bibhisana became friends
with Lord Ramacandra, he promised that if by chance or will he broke the laws of friendship with Lord
Ramacandra, he would become a brahmana or a king in Kali-yuga. In this age, as Bibhisana indicated,
both brahmanas and kings are in a wretched condition. Actually there are no kings or brahmanas in this
age, and due to their absence the whole world is in a chaotic condition and is always in distress.
Compared to present standards, Maharaja Gaya was a true representative of Lord Visnu; therefore he was
known as Mahapurusa.
