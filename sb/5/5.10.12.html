ksetrajna eta manaso vibhutir
jivasya maya-racitasya nityah
avirhitah kvapi tirohitas ca
suddho vicaste hy avisuddha-kartuh
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ksetra-jnah--the individual soul; etah--all these; manasah--of the mind; vibhutih--different activities;
jivasya--of the living entity; maya-racitasya--created by the external, material energy; nityah--from time
immemorial; avirhitah--sometimes manifested; kvapi--somewhere; tirohitah ca--and not manifested;
suddhah--purified; vicaste--sees this; hi--certainly; avisuddha--unpurified; kartuh--of the doer.
<h2>Translation</h2>
The individual soul bereft of Krsna consciousness has many ideas and activities created in the mind by
the external energy. They have been existing from time immemorial. Sometimes they are manifest in the
wakening state and in the dream state, but during deep sleep [unconsciousness] or trance, they disappear.
A person who is liberated in this life [jivan-mukta] can see all these things vividly.
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.3), ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata. There are two
kinds of ksetrajna, or living beings. One is the individual living being, and the other is the supreme living
being. The ordinary living being knows about his body to some extent, but the Supreme, Paramatma,
knows the condition of all bodies. The individual living being is localized, and the Supreme. Paramatma.
is all-pervading. In this sloka the word ksetrajna refers to an ordinary living being, not the supreme living
being. This ordinary living being is of two kinds--nitya-baddha or nitya-mukta. One is eternally
conditioned and the other eternally liberated. The eternally liberated living being; are in the Vaikuntha
jagat, the spiritual world, and they never fall into the material world. Those in the material world are
conditioned souls, nitya-baddha. The nitya-baddhas can become liberated by controlling the mind
because the cause of conditioned life is the mind. When the mind is trained and the soul is not under the
mind's control, the soul can be liberated even in this material world. When it is liberated, one is called
jivan-mukta. A jivan-mukta knows how he has become conditioned; therefore he tries to purify himself
and return home, back to Godhead. The eternally conditioned soul is eternally conditioned because he is
controlled by the mind. The conditioned state and liberated state are compared to the sleeping,
unconscious state and the awakened state. Those who are sleeping and unconscious are eternally
conditioned, but those who are awake understand that they are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Therefore even in this material world, they engage in Krsna's service. As
confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami: iha yasya harer dasye. If one takes to Krsna's service, he is liberated,
even though he appears to be a conditioned soul within the material world. Jivan-muktah sa ucyate. In
any condition, one is to be considered liberated if his only business is to serve Krsna.

the shelter of everything; ksetra-jnah--known as ksetrajna; atma--the vital force; idam--this material
world; anupravistah--entered within.
<h2>Translation</h2>
There are two kinds of ksetrajna--the living entity, as explained above, and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is explained as follows. He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and
is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does
not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with
Lord Brahma. He is called Narayana, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this
material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is
therefore known as Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present
within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings,
moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15). Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam
apohanam ca. Every living being is controlled by the supreme living being, Paramatma, who resides
within everyone's heart. He is the purusa, the purusa-avatara, who creates this material world. The first
purusa-avatara is Maha-Visnu, and that Maha-Visnu is the plenary portion of the plenary portion of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Krsna's first expansion is Baladeva, and His next expansions are
Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Vasudeva is the original cause of the brahmajyoti, and
the brahmajyoti is the expansion of the rays of the body of Vasudeva.
yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-kotikotisv
asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam
tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of
His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which
displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of
universes." (Brahma-samhita 5.40) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus described in Bhagavadgita:
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in
them." (Bg. 9.4)
This is the position of the plenary expansions of Krsna as the all-pervading Vasudeva, Sankarsana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha.
