<h2>Text</h2>
deva-tiryan-manusyanam
sarisrpa-savirudham
sarva-jiva-nikayanam
surya atma drg-isvarah
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
deva--of the demigods; tiryak--the lower animals; manusyanam--and the human beings; sarisrpa--the
insects and the serpents; sa-virudham--and the plants and trees; sarva-jiva-nikayanam--of all groups of
living entities; suryah--the sun-god; atma--the life and soul; drk--of the eyes; isvarah--the personality of
Godhead.
<h2>Translation</h2>
All living entities, including demigods, human beings, animals, birds, insects, reptiles, creepers and
trees, depend upon the heat and light given by the sun-god from the sun planet. Furthermore, it is
because of the sun's presence that all living entities can see, and therefore he is called drg-isvara, the
Personality of Godhead presiding over sight.
PURPORT
In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, surya atma atmatvenopasyah. The actual life
and soul of all living entities within this universe is the sun. He is therefore upasya, worshipable. We
worship the sun-god by chanting the Gayatri mantra (om bhur bhuvah svah tat savitur varenyam bhargo
devasya dhimahi). Surya is the life and soul of this universe, and there are innumerable universes for
which a sun-god is the life and soul, just as the Supreme personality of Godhead is the life and soul of the
entire creation. We have information that Vairaja, Hiranyagarbha, entered the great, dull, material globe
called the sun. This indicates that the theory held by so-called scientists that no one lives there is wrong.
Bhagavad-gita also says that Krsna first instructed Bhagavad-gita to the sun-god (imam vivasvate yogam
proktavan aham avyayam). Therefore the sun is not vacant. It is inhabited by living entities, and the
predominating deity is Vairaja, or Vivasvan. The difference between the sun and earth is that the sun is a
fiery planet, but everyone there has a suitable body and can live there without difficulty.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "Studying the Structure of the Universe."
Chapter Twenty-one
The Movements of the Sun
This chapter informs us of the movements of the sun. The sun is not stationary; it is also moving like
the other planets. The sun's movements determine the duration of night and day. When the sun travels
north of the equator, it moves slowly during the day and very quickly at night, thus increasing the
duration of the daytime and decreasing the duration of night. Similarly, when the sun travels south of the
equator, the exact opposite is true--the duration of the day decreases, and the duration of night increases.
When the sun enters Karkata-rasi (Cancer) and then travels to Simha-rasi (Leo) and so on through
Dhanuh-rasi (Sagittarius), its course is called Daksinayana, the southern way, and when the sun enters
Makara-rasi (Capricorn) and thereafter travels through Kumbharasi (Aquarius) and so on through
Mithuna-rasi (Gemini), its course is called Uttarayana, the northern way. When the sun is in Mesa-rasi
(Aries) and Tula-rasi (Libra), the duration of day and night are equal.
On Manasottara Mountain are the abodes of four demigods. East of Sumeru Mountain is Devadhani,
where King Indra lives, and south of Sumeru is Samyamani, the abode of Yamaraja, the superintendent of
death. Similarly, west of Sumeru is Nimlocani, the abode of Varuna, the demigod who controls the water,
and north of Sumeru is Vibhavari, where the demigod of the moon lives. Sunrise, noon, sunset and
midnight occur in all these places because of the movements of the sun. Diametrically opposite the place
where the sunrise takes places and the sun is seen by human eyes, the sun will be setting and passing
away from human vision. Similarly, the people residing diametrically opposite the point where it is
midday will be experiencing midnight. The sun rises and sets with all the other planets, headed by the
moon and other luminaries.
The entire kala-cakra, or wheel of time, is established on the wheel of the sun-god's chariot. This wheel
is known as Samvatsara. The seven horses pulling the chariot of the sun are known as Gayatri, Brhati,
Usnik, Jagati, Tristup, Anustup and Pankti. They are harnessed by a demigod known as Arunadeva to a
yoke 900,000 yojanas wide. Thus the chariot carries Adityadeva, the sun-god. Always staying in front of
the sun-god and offering their prayers are sixty thousand sages known as Valikhilyas. There are fourteen
Gandharvas, Apsaras and other demigods, who are divided into seven parties and who perform ritualistic
activities every month to worship the Supersoul through the sun-god according to different names. Thus
the sun-god travels through the universe for a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas (760,800,000 miles) at a
speed of 16,004 miles at every moment.
