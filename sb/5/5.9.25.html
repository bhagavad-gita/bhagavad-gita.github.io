<h2>Translation</h2>
O my dear lord, you are the friend of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the friend of all living
entities. You are therefore equal to everyone, and you are free from the bodily conception. Although I
have committed an offense by insulting you, I know that there is no loss or gain for you due to my insult.
You are fixed in your determination, but I have committed an offense. Because of this, even though I may
be as strong as Lord Siva, I shall be vanquished without delay due to my offense at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Rahugana was very intelligent and conscious of the inauspicious effects arising from insulting
a Vaisnava. He was therefore very anxious to be excused by Jada Bharata. Following in the footsteps of
Maharaja Rahugana, everyone should be very cautious not to commit an offense at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava. Srila Vrndavana dasa Thakura in the Caitanya-bhagavata (Madhya 13) says:
sulapani-sama yadi bhakta-ninda kare
bhagavata pramana----tathapi sighra mare
hena vaisnavere ninde sarvajna ha-i
se janera adhah-pata sarva-sastre ka-i
"Even if one is as strong as Lord Siva, who carries a trident in his hand, one will nonetheless fall down
from his spiritual position if he tries to insult a Vaisnava. That is the verdict of all Vedic scriptures." He
also says this in Caitanya-bhagavata (Madhya 22):
vaisnavera ninda karibeka yara gana
tara raksa samarthya nahika kona jana
sulapani-sama yadi vaisnavere ninde
tathapiha nasa yaya----kahe sastra-vrnde
iha na maniya ye sujana ninda kare
janme janme se papistha daiva-dose mare
"One who blasphemes a Vaisnava cannot be protected by anyone. Even if a person is as strong as Lord
Siva, if he blasphemes a Vaisnava, he is sure to be destroyed. This is the verdict of all sastras. If one does
not care for the verdict of the sastras and dares blaspheme a Vaisnava, he suffers life after life because of
this."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "The Discussion Between Jada Bharata and Maharaja Rahugana."
Chapter Eleven
Jada Bharata Instructs King Rahugana
In this chapter the brahmana Jada Bharata instructs Maharaja Rahugana in detail. He tells the King:
"You are not very experienced, yet you pose yourself as a learned person because you are very proud of
your knowledge. Actually a person who is on the transcendental platform does not care for social
behavior that sacrifices spiritual advancement. Social behavior comes within the jurisdiction of karmakanda,
material benefit. No one can spiritually advance by such activities. The conditioned soul is always
overpowered by the modes of material nature. and consequently he is simply concerned with material
benefits and auspicious and inauspicious material things. In other words, the mind, which is the leader of
the senses, is absorbed in material activities life after life. Thus he continuously gets different types of
bodies and suffers miserable material conditions. On the basis of mental concoction, social behavior has
been formulated. If one's mind is absorbed in these activities, he certainly remains conditioned within the
material world. According to different opinions, there are eleven or twelve mental activities, which can be
transformed into hundreds and thousands. A person who is not Krsna conscious is subjected to all these
mental concoctions and is thus governed by the material energy. The living entity who is free from mental
concoctions attains the platform of pure spirit soul. devoid of material contamination. There are two types
of living entities--jivatma and Paramatma, the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. That Supreme Soul
in His ultimate realization is Lord Vasudeva. Krsna. He enters into everyone's heart and controls the living
entity in his different activities. He is therefore the supreme shelter of all living entities. One can
understand the Supreme Soul and one's position in relationship with Him when one is completely freed
from the unwanted association of ordinary men. In this way one can become fit to cross the ocean of
nescience. The cause of conditional Life is attachment to the external energy. One has to conquer these
mental concoctions: unless one does so, he will never be freed from material anxieties. Although mental
concoctions have no value, their influence is still very formidable. No one should neglect to control the
mind. If one does, the mind becomes so powerful that one immediately forgets his real position.
Forgetting that he is an eternal servant of Krsna and that service to Krsna is his only business, one is
doomed by material nature to serve the objects of the senses. One should kill mental concoctions by the
sword of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee [guru-krsna-prasade paya
bhakti-lata-bija]"
