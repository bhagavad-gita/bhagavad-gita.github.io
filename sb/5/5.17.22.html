<h2>Translation</h2>
O supreme unconquerable Lord, when they become absorbed in thoughts of material enjoyment, Lord
Brahma and Lord Siva, as well as other demigods and demons, undergo severe penances and austerities to
receive my benedictions. But I do not favor anyone, however great he may be; unless he is always engaged
in the service of Your lotus feet. Because I always keep You within my heart, I cannot favor anyone but a
devotee.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the goddess of fortune, Laksmidevi, clearly states that she does not bestow her favor on any
materialistic person. Although sometimes a materialist becomes very opulent in the eyes of another
materialist, such opulence is bestowed upon him by the goddess Durgadevi, a material expansion of the
goddess of fortune, not by Laksmidevi herself. Those who desire material wealth worship Durgadevi with
the following mantra: dhanam dehi rupam dehi rupa-pati-bhajam dehi. "O worshipable mother
Durgadevi, please give me wealth, strength, fame, a good wife and so on." By pleasing goddess Durga one
can obtain such benefits, but since they are temporary, they result only in maya-sukha (illusory
happiness). As stated by Prahlada Maharaja, maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan: those who work
very hard for material benefits are vimudhas, foolish rascals, because such happiness will not endure. On
the other hand, devotees like Prahlada and Dhruva Maharaja achieved extraordinary material opulences,
but such opulences were not maya-sukha. When a devotee acquires unparalleled opulences, they are the
direct gifts of the goddess of fortune, who resides in the heart of Narayana.
The material opulences a person obtains by offering prayers to the goddess Durga are temporary. As
described in Bhagavad-gita (7.23), antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: men of meager
intelligence desire temporary happiness. We have actually seen that one of the disciples of
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura wanted to enjoy the property of his spiritual master, and the spiritual
master, being merciful toward him, gave him the temporary property, but not the power to preach the cult
of Caitanya Mahaprabhu all over the world. That special mercy of the power to preach is given to a
devotee who does not want anything material from his spiritual master but wants only to serve him. The
story of the demon Ravana illustrates this point. Although Ravana tried to abduct the goddess of fortune
Sitadevi from the custody of Lord Ramacandra, he could not possibly do so. The Sitadevi he forcibly took
with him was not the original Sitadevi, but an expansion of maya, or Durgadevi. As a result, instead of
winning the favor of the real goddess of fortune, Ravana and his whole family were vanquished by the
power of Durgadevi (srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka).
