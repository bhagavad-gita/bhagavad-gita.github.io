My dear King, I have thus described how people generally act according to their different desires and, as
a result, get different types of bodies in higher or lower planets. You inquired of these things from me, and
I have explained to you whatever I have heard from authorities. What shall I speak of now?
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Glories of Lord Ananta."
Chapter Twenty-six
A Description of the Hellish Planets
The Twenty-sixth Chapter describes how a sinful man goes to different hells, where he is punished in
various ways by the assistants of Yamaraja. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (3.27):
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to
be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." The foolish person thinks he is
independent of any law. He thinks there is no God or regulative principle and that he can do whatever he
likes. Thus he engages in different sinful activities, and as a result, he is put into different hellish
conditions life after life, to be punished by the laws of nature. The basic principle of his suffering is that
he foolishly thinks himself independent, although he is strictly under the control of the laws of material
nature. These laws act due to the influence of the three modes of nature, and therefore each human being
also works under three different types of influence. According to how he acts, he suffers different
reactions in his next life or in this life. Religious persons act differently from atheists, and therefore they
suffer different reactions.
Sukadeva Gosvami describes the following twenty-eight hells: Tamisra, Andhatamisra, Raurava,
Maharaurava, Kumbhipaka. Kalasutra, Asi-patravana, Sukaramukha, Andhakupa, Krmibhojana.
Sandamsa, Taptasurmi, Vajrakantaka-salmali, Vaitarani, Puyoda, Pranarodha, Visasana, Lalabhaksa,
Sarameyadana, Avici, Ayahpana. Ksarakardama, Raksogana-bhojana, Sulaprota, Dandasuka. Avatanirodhana,
Paryavartana and Sucimukha.
A person who steals another's money, wife or possessions is put into the hell known as Tamisra. A man
who tricks someone and enjoys his wife is put into the extremely hellish condition known as
Andhatamisra. A foolish person absorbed in the bodily concept of life, who on the basis of this principle
maintains himself or his wife and children by committing violence against other living entities, is put into
the hell known as Raurava. There the animals he killed take birth as creatures called rurus and cause great
suffering for him. Those who kill different animals and birds and then cook them are put by the agents of
Yamaraja into the hell known as Kumbhipaka, where they are boiled in oil. A person who kills a
brahmana is put into the hell known as Kalasutra, where the land, perfectly level and made of copper, is
as hot as an oven. The killer of a brahmana burns in that land for many years. One who does not follow
scriptural injunctions but who does everything whimsically or follows some rascal is put into the hell
known as Asi-patravana. A government official who poorly administers justice, or who punishes an
innocent man, is taken by the assistants of Yamaraja to the hell known as Sukaramukha, where he is
mercilessly beaten.
God has given advanced consciousness to the human being. Therefore he can feel the suffering and
happiness of other living beings. The human being bereft of his conscience, however, is prone to cause
suffering for other living beings. The assistants of Yamaraja put such a person into the hell known as
Andhakupa, where he receives proper punishment from his victims. Any person who does not receive or
feed a guest properly but who personally enjoys eating is put into the hell known as Krmibhojana. There
an unlimited number of worms and insects continuously bite him.
A thief is put into the hell known as Sandamsa. A person who has sexual relations with a woman who is
not to be enjoyed is put into the hell known as Taptasurmi. A person who enjoys sexual relations with
animals is put into the hell known as Vajrakantaka-salmali. A person born into an aristocratic or highly
placed family but who does not act accordingly is put into the hellish trench of blood, pus and urine
called the Vaitarani River. One who lives like an animal is put into the hell called Puyoda. A person who
mercilessly kills animals in the forest without sanction is put into the hell called Pranarodha. A person
who kills animals in the name of religious sacrifice is put into the hell named Visasana. A man who forces
his wife to drink his semen is put into the hell called Lalabhaksa. One who sets a fire or administers
poison to kill someone is put into the hell known as Sarameyadana. A man who earns his livelihood by
bearing false witness is put into the hell known as Avici.
A person addicted to drinking wine is put into the hell named Ayahpana. One who violates etiquette by
not showing proper respect to superiors is put into the hell known as Ksarakardama. A person who
sacrifices human beings to Bhairava is put into the hell called Raksogana-bhojana. A person who kills pet
animals is put into the hell called Sulaprota. A person who gives trouble to others is put into the hell
known as Dandasuka. One who imprisons a living entity within a cave is put into the hell known as
Avata-nirodhana. A person who shows unwarranted wrath toward a guest in his house is put into the hell
called Paryavartana. A person maddened by possessing riches and thus deeply absorbed in thinking of
how to collect money is put into the hell known as Sucimukha.
After describing the hellish planets, Sukadeva Gosvami describes how pious persons are elevated to the
highest planetary system, where the demigods live, and how they then come back again to this earth when
the results of their pious activities are finished. Finally he describes the universal form of the Lord and
glorifies the Lord's activities.
