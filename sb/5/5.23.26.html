<h2>Text</h2>
tasya mahanubhavasyanupatham amrjita-kasayah ko vasmad-vidhah parihina-bhagavad-anugraha
upajigamisatiti.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--of Prahlada Maharaja; maha-anubhavasya--who was an exalted devotee; anupatham--the path;
amrjita-kasayah--a person who is materially contaminated; kah--what; va--or; asmat-vidhah--like us;
parihina-bhagavat-anugrahah--being without the favor of the Supreme personality of Godhead;
upajigamisati--desires to follow; iti--thus.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bali Maharaja said: Persons like us, who are still attached to material enjoyment, who are contaminated
by the modes of material nature and who lack the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot
follow the supreme path of Prahlada Maharaja, the exalted devotee of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that for spiritual realization one must follow great personalities like Lord Brahma, Devarsi
Narada, Lord Siva and Prahlada Maharaja. The path of bhakti is not at all difficult if we follow in the
footsteps of previous acaryas and authorities, but those who are too materially contaminated by the modes
of material nature cannot follow them. Although Bali Maharaja was actually following the path of his
grandfather, because of his great humility he thought that he was not. It is characteristic of advanced
Vaisnavas following the principles of bhakti that they think themselves ordinary human beings. This is
not an artificial exhibition of humility; a Vaisnava sincerely thinks this way and therefore never admits his
exalted position.
