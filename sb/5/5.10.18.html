<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear sir, it appears that the influence of your great spiritual knowledge is hidden. Factually you are
bereft of all material association and fully absorbed in the thought of the Supreme. Consequently you are
unlimitedly advanced in spiritual knowledge. Please tell me why you are wandering around like a dullard.
O great, saintly person, you have spoken words approved by the yogic process, but it is not possible for us
to understand what you have said. Therefore kindly explain it.
PURPORT
Saintly people like Jada Bharata do not speak ordinary words. Whatever they say is approved by great
yogis and those advanced in spiritual life. That is the difference between ordinary people and saintly
people. The listener must also be advanced to understand the words of such exalted, spiritually advanced
people as Jada Bharata. Bhagavad-gita was spoken to Arjuna, not to others. Lord Krsna especially selected
Arjuna for instruction in spiritual knowledge because Arjuna happened to be a great devotee and
confidential friend. Similarly, great personalities also speak to the advanced, not to sudras, vaisyas,
women or unintelligent men. Sometimes it is very risky to give great philosophical instructions to
ordinary people, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, for the benefit of the fallen souls of Kali-yuga, has given
us a very nice instrument, the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra. The general mass of people, although
sudras and less, can be purified by chanting this Hare Krsna mantra. Then they can understand the
exalted philosophical statements of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. Our Krsna consciousness
movement has therefore adopted the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra for the general masses.
When people gradually become purified, they are instructed in the lessons of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Materialistic people like stri, sudra and dvija-bandhu cannot understand words of spiritual
advancement, yet one can take to the shelter of a Vaisnava, for he knows the art of enlightening even
sudras in the highly elevated subject matter spoken in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.
