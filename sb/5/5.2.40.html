<h2>Text</h2>
bhu-samsthanam krtam yena
sarid-giri-vanadibhih
sima ca bhuta-nirvrtyai
dvipe dvipe vibhagasah
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhu-samsthanam--the situation of the earth; krtam--done; yena--by whom; sarit--by rivers; giri--by hills
and mountains; vana-adibhih--by forests and so on; sima--boundaries; ca--also; bhuta--of different
nations; nirvrtyai--to stop fighting; dvipe dvipe--on the various islands; vibhagasah--separately.
<h2>Translation</h2>
"To stop the quarreling among different peoples, Maharaja Priyavrata marked boundaries at rivers and
at the edges of mountains and forests so that no one would trespass upon another's property."
PURPORT
The example set by Maharaja Priyavrata in marking off different states is still followed. As indicated
here, different classes of men are destined to live in different areas, and therefore the boundaries of
various tracts of land, which are described here as islands, should be defined by different rivers, forests
and hills. This is also mentioned in relation to Maharaja Prthu, who was born from the dead body of his
father by the manipulation of great sages. Maharaja Prthu's father was very sinful, and therefore a black
man called Nisada was first born from his dead body. The Naisada race was given a place in the forest
because by nature they are thieves and rogues. As animals are given places in various forests and hills,
men who are like animals are also destined to live there. One cannot be promoted to civilized life unless
one comes to Krsna consciousness, for by nature one is destined to live in a particular situation according
to one's karma and association with the modes of nature. If men want to live in harmony and peace, they
must take to Krsna consciousness, for they cannot achieve the highest standard while absorbed in the
bodily concept of life. Maharaja Priyavrata divided the surface of the globe into different islands so that
each class of men would live peacefully and not clash with the others. The modern idea of nationhood has
gradually developed from the divisions made by Maharaja Priyavrata.
