<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes the living entity in the forest of material existence takes shelter of creepers and desires to
hear the chirping of the birds in those creepers. Being afraid of roaring lions in the forest, he makes
friends with cranes, herons and vultures.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the forest of the material world there are many animals and birds, trees and creepers. Sometimes the
living entity wants to take shelter of the creepers; in other words, he wants to be happy by being
embraced by the creeperlike arms of his wife. Within the creepers there are many chirping birds; this
indicates that he wants to satisfy himself by hearing the sweet voice of his wife. In old age, however, he
sometimes becomes afraid of imminent death, which is compared to a roaring lion. To save himself from
the lion's attack, he takes shelter of some bogus svamis, yogis, incarnations, pretenders and cheaters.
Being misled by the illusory energy in this way, he spoils his life. It is said, harim vina mrtim na taranti:
no one can be saved from the imminent danger of death without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The word hari indicates the lion as well as the Supreme Lord. To be saved from the hands of
Hari, the lion of death, one must take shelter of the supreme Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
People with a poor fund of knowledge take shelter of nondevotee cheaters and pretenders in order to be
saved from the clutches of death. In the forest of the material world, the living entity first of all wants to
be very happy by taking shelter of the creeperlike arms of his wife and hearing her sweet voice. Later. he
sometimes takes shelter of so-called gurus and sadhus who are like cranes. herons and vultures. Thus he
is cheated both ways by not taking shelter of the Supreme Lord.
