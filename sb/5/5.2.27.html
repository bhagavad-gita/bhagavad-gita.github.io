<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus situated in the renounced order from the beginning of their lives, all three of them completely
controlled the activities of their senses and thus became great saints. They concentrated their minds
always upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the resting place of the totality
of living entities and who is therefore celebrated as Vasudeva. Lord Vasudeva is the only shelter of those
who are actually afraid of material existence. By constantly thinking of His lotus feet, these three sons of
Maharaja Priyavrata became advanced in pure devotional service. By the prowess of their devotional
service, they could directly perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's
heart as the Supersoul, and realize that there was qualitatively no difference between themselves and Him.
PURPORT
The paramahamsa stage is the topmost position in renounced life. In sannyasa, the renounced order,
there are four stages--kuticaka, bahudaka, parivrajakacarya and paramahamsa. According to the Vedic
system, when one accepts the renounced order, he stays outside his village in a cottage, and his
necessities, especially his food, are supplied from home. This is called the kuticaka stage. When a sannyasi
advances further, he no longer accepts anything from home: instead, he collects his necessities, especially
his food, from many places. This system is called madhukari, which literally means "the profession of the
bumblebees." As bumblebees collect honey from many flowers, a little from each, so a sannyasi should
beg from door to door but not accept very much food from any particular house; he should collect a little
bit from every house. This is called the bahudaka stage. When a sannyasi is still more experienced, he
travels all over the world to preach the glories of Lord Vasudeva. He is then known as parivrajakacarya.
The sannyasi reaches the paramahamsa stage when he finishes his preaching work and sits down in one
place, strictly for the sake of advancing in spiritual life. An actual paramahamsa is one who completely
controls his senses and engages in the unalloyed service of the Lord. Therefore all three of these sons of
Priyavrata, namely Kavi, Mahavira and Savana, were situated in the paramahamsa stage from the very
beginning. Their senses could not disturb them, for their senses were completely engaged in serving the
Lord. Therefore the three brothers are described in this verse as upasama-silah. Upasama means
"completely subdued." Because they completely subdued their senses, they are understood to have been
great sages and saints.
After subduing their senses, the three brothers concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of
Vasudeva, Lord Krsna. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.19), vasudevah sarvam iti. The lotus feet of Vasudeva
are everything. Lord Vasudeva is the reservoir of all living entities. When this cosmic manifestation is
dissolved, all living entities enter the supreme body of the Lord, Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who merges
within the body of Maha-Visnu. Both of these visnu-tattvas are vasudeva-tattvas, and therefore the great
sages Kavi, Mahavira and Savana concentrated always upon the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna. In this
way they could understand that the Supersoul within the heart is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and they could recognize their identity with Him. The complete description of this realization is that
simply by discharging the unalloyed form of devotional service, one can realize his self completely. The
parama-bhakti-yoga mentioned in this verse means that a living entity, by dint of unalloyed devotional
service, has no other interest than the service of the Lord, as described in Bhagavad-gita (vasudevah
sarvam iti). By parama-bhakti-yoga, by elevating oneself to the highest platform of loving service, one can
automatically be relieved from the bodily concept of life and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face
to face. As confirmed in Brahma-samhita:
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
An advanced devotee, who is known as a sat, or saint, can always see within his heart the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, face to face. Krsna, Syamasundara, expands Himself by His plenary portion, and
thus a devotee can always see Him within his heart.
