yam ahur asya sthiti-janma-samyamam
tribhir vihinam yam anantam rsayah
na veda siddhartham iva kvacit sthitam
bhu-mandalam murdha-sahasra-dhamasu
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yam--whom; ahuh--they said; asya--of the material world; sthiti--the maintenance; janma--creation;
samyamam--annihilation; tribhih--these three; vihinam--without; yam--which; anantam--unlimited;
rsayah--all the great sages; na--not; veda--feels; siddha-artham--a mustard seed; iva--like; kvacit--where;
sthitam--situated; bhu-mandalam--the universe; murdha-sahasra-dhamasu--on the hundreds and
thousands of hoods of the Lord.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva continued: All the great sages accept the Lord as the source of creation, maintenance and
destruction, although He actually has nothing to do with these activities. Therefore the Lord is called
unlimited. Although the Lord in His incarnation as Sesa holds all the universes on His hoods, each
universe feels no heavier than a mustard seed to Him. Therefore, what person desiring perfection will not
worship the Lord?
<h2>Purport</h2>
The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead known as Sesa or Ananta has unlimited
strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation. As described in this verse, Ananta's strength
is so great that the innumerable universes rest on His hoods. He has the bodily features of a snake with
thousands of hoods, and since His strength is unlimited, all the universes resting on His hoods feel no
heavier than mustard seeds. We can just imagine how insignificant a mustard seed is on the hood of a
serpent. In this connection, the reader is referred to Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila, Chapter Five, verses
117-125. There it is stated that Lord Visnu's incarnation as the serpentine Ananta Sesa Naga supports all
the universes on His hoods. By our calculation, a universe may be very, very heavy, but because the Lord
is ananta (unlimited), He feels the weight to be no heavier than a mustard seed.

<h2>Translation</h2>
From that Supreme Personality of Godhead appears Lord Brahma, whose body is made from the total
material energy, the reservoir of intelligence predominated by the passionate mode of material nature.
From Lord Brahma, I myself am born as a representation of false ego known as Rudra. By my own power I
create all the other demigods, the five elements and the senses. Therefore, I worship the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is greater than any of us and under whose control are situated all the
demigods, material elements and senses, and even Lord Brahma and I myself, like birds bound by a rope.
Only by the Lord's grace can we create, maintain and annihilate the material world. Therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Being.
<h2>Purport</h2>
A summary of creation is given in this verse. From Sankarsana, Maha-Visnu expands, and from Maha-
Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu expands. Lord Brahma, who was born of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, fathers
Lord Siva, from whom all the other demigods gradually evolve. Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu
are incarnations of the different material qualities. Lord Visnu is actually above all material qualities, but
He accepts control of sattva-guna (the mode of goodness) to maintain the universe. Lord Brahma is born
from the mahat-tattva. Brahma creates the entire universe, Lord Visnu maintains it, and Lord Siva
annihilates it. The Supreme personality of Godhead controls all the most important demigods--especially
Lord Brahma and Lord Siva--exactly as the owner of a bird controls it by binding it with a rope.
Sometimes vultures are controlled in this way.
