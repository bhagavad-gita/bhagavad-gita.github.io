TRANSLATION
Due to his being especially gifted with the Lord's mercy, Bharata Maharaja could remember the
incidents of his past life. Although he received the body of a brahmana, he was still very much afraid of
his relatives and friends who were not devotees. He was always very cautious of such association because
he feared that he would again fall down. Consequently he manifested himself before the public eye as a
madman--dull, blind and deaf--so that others would not try to talk to him. In this way he saved himself
from bad association. Within he was always thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord and chanting the Lord's
glories, which save one from the bondage of fruitive action. In this way he saved himself from the
onslaught of nondevotee associates.
PURPORT
Every living entity is bound by different activities due to association with the modes of nature. As stated
in Bhagavad-gita, karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu: "This is due to his association with
that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species." (Bg. 13.22)
We get different types of bodies among 8,400,000 species according to our karma. Karmana daivanetrena:
we work under the influence of material nature contaminated by the three modes, and thus we
get a certain type of body according to superior order. This is called karma-bandha. To get out of this
karma-bandha, one must engage himself in devotional service. Then one will not be affected by the modes
of material nature.
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena

brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." (Bg. 14.26) To remain
immune from the material qualities, one must engage himself in devotional service--sravanam kirtanam
visnoh. That is the perfection of life. When Maharaja Bharata took birth as a brahmana, he was not very
interested in the duties of a brahmana, but within he remained a pure Vaisnava, always thinking of the
lotus feet of the Lord. As advised in Bhagavad-gita: man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam
namaskuru. This is the only process by which one can be saved from the danger of repeated birth and
death.
