na casya kascin nipunena dhatur
avaiti jantuh kumanisa utih
namani rupani mano-vacobhih
santanvato nata-caryam ivajnah
SYNONYMS
na--not; ca--and; asya--of Him; kascit--anyone; nipunena--by dexterity; dhatuh--of the creator; avaiti--
can know; jantuh--the living being; kumanisah--with a poor fund of knowledge; utih--activities of the
Lord; namani--His names; rupani--His forms; manah-vacobhih--by dint of mental speculation or
deliverance of speeches; santanvatah--displaying; nata-caryam--a dramatic action; iva--like; ajnah--the
foolish.
TRANSLATION
The foolish with a poor fund of knowledge cannot know the transcendental nature of the forms, names
and activities of the Lord, who is playing like an actor in a drama. Nor can they express such things,
neither in their speculations nor in their words.
PURPORT
No one can properly describe the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore it is said that
He is beyond the expression of mind and speech. And yet there are some men, with a poor fund of
knowledge, who desire to understand the Absolute Truth by imperfect mental speculation and faulty
description of His activities. To the layman His activities, appearance and disappearance, His names, His
forms, His paraphernalia, His personalities and all things in relation with Him are mysterious. There are
two classes of materialists, namely the fruitive workers and the empiric philosophers. The fruitive workers
have practically no information of the Absolute Truth, and the mental speculators, after being frustrated
in fruitive activities, turn their faces towards the Absolute Truth and try to know Him by mental
speculation. And for all these men, the Absolute Truth is a mystery, as the jugglery of the magician is a
mystery to children. Being deceived by the jugglery of the Supreme Being, the nondevotees, who may be
very dexterous in fruitive work and mental speculation, are always in ignorance. With such limited
knowledge, they are unable to penetrate into the mysterious region of transcendence. The mental
speculators are a little more progressive than the gross materialists or the fruitive workers, but because
they are also within the grip of illusion, they take it for granted that anything which has form, a name and
activities is but a product of material energy. For them the Supreme Spirit is formless, nameless and
inactive. And because such mental speculators equalize the transcendental name and form of the Lord
with mundane names and form, they are in fact in ignorance. With such a poor fund of knowledge, there
is no access to the real nature of the Supreme Being. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord is always in a
transcendental position, even when He is within the material world. But ignorant men consider the Lord
one of the great personalities of the world, and thus they are misled by the illusory energy.
