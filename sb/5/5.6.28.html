TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thus the great well-wisher of everyone, the Supreme Lord Rsabhadeva,
instructed His own sons. Although they were perfectly educated and cultured, He instructed them just to
set an example of how a father should instruct his sons before retiring from family life. Sannyasis, who are
no longer bound by fruitive activity and who have taken to devotional service after all their material
desires have been vanquished, also learn by these instructions. Lord Rsabhadeva instructed His one
hundred sons, of whom the eldest, Bharata, was a very advanced devotee and a follower of Vaisnavas. In
order to rule the whole world, the Lord enthroned His eldest son on the royal seat. Thereafter, although
still at home, Lord Rsabhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair. Then the Lord took
the sacrificial fire within Himself, and He left Brahmavarta to tour the whole world.
PURPORT
Actually the instructions given to Lord Rsabhadeva's sons were not exactly meant for His sons because
they were already educated and highly advanced in knowledge. Rather, these instructions were meant for
sannyasis who intend to become advanced devotees. Sannyasis must abide by Lord Rsabhadeva's
instructions while on the path of devotional service. Lord Rsabhadeva retired from family life and lived
like a naked madman even while still with His family.
