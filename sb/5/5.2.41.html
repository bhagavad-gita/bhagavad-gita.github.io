TRANSLATION
"As a great follower and devotee of the sage Narada, Maharaja Priyavrata considered hellish the
opulences he had achieved by dint of fruitive activities and mystic power, whether in the lower or
heavenly planetary systems or in human society."
PURPORT
Srila Rupa Gosvami has said that the position of a devotee is so superexcellent that a devotee does not
consider any material opulence worth having. There are different types of opulences on earth, in the
heavenly planets and even in the lower planetary system, known as Patala. A devotee, however, knows
that they are all material, and consequently he is not at all interested in them. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
param drstva nivartate. Sometimes yogis and jnanis voluntarily give up all material opulences to practice
their system of liberation and taste spiritual bliss. However, they frequently fall down because artificial
renunciation of material opulences cannot endure. One must have a superior taste in spiritual life; then he
can give up material opulence. Maharaja Priyavrata had already tasted spiritual bliss, and therefore he had
no interest in any of the material achievements available in the lower, higher or middle planetary systems.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Fifth Canto, First Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam, entitled
"The Activities of Maharaja Priyavrata."
Chapter Two
The Activities of Maharaja Agnidhra
In this chapter, the character of Maharaja Agnidhra is described. When Maharaja Priyavrata went off for
spiritual realization, his son Agnidhra became the ruler of Jambudvipa, in accordance with Maharaja
Priyavrata's instructions, and maintained its residents with the same affection a father feels for his sons.
Once Maharaja Agnidhra desired to have a son, and therefore he entered a cave of Mandara Mountain to
practice austerity. Understanding his desire, Lord Brahma sent a celestial girl named Purvacitti to
Agnidhra's hermitage. After dressing herself very attractively, she presented herself before him with
various feminine movements, and Agnidhra was naturally attracted to her. The girl's actions, expressions,
smile, sweet words and moving eyes were fascinating to him. Agnidhra was expert in flattery. Thus he
attracted the celestial girl, who was pleased to accept him as her husband because of his mellifluous
words. She enjoyed royal happiness with Agnidhra for many years before returning to her abode in the
heavenly planets. In her womb Agnidhra begot nine sons--Nabhi, Kimpurusa, Harivarsa, Ilavrta, Ramyaka,
Hiranmaya, Kuru, Bhadrasva and Ketumala. He gave them nine islands with names corresponding to
theirs. Agnidhra, however, his senses unsatisfied, was always thinking of his celestial wife, and therefore
in his next life he was born in her celestial planet. After the death of Agnidhra, his nine sons married nine
daughters of Meru named Merudevi, Pratirupa, Ugradamstri, Lata, Ramya, Syama, Nari, Bhadra and
Devaviti.
