<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, Prince Priyavrata was a great devotee because he sought
the lotus feet of Narada, his spiritual master, and thus achieved the highest perfection in transcendental
knowledge. With advanced knowledge, he always engaged in discussing spiritual subjects and did not
divert his attention to anything else. The Prince's father then asked him to take charge of ruling the world.
He tried to convince Priyavrata that this was his duty as indicated in the revealed scriptures. Prince
Priyavrata, however, was continuously practicing bhakti-yoga by constantly remembering the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, thus engaging all his senses in the service of the Lord. Therefore, although the
order of his father could not be rejected, the Prince did not welcome it. Thus he very conscientiously
raised the question of whether he might be diverted from devotional service by accepting the
responsibility of ruling over the world.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: "Without serving
the lotus feet of a pure Vaisnava or spiritual master, no one has ever attained perfect liberation from
material bondage." prince Priyavrata regularly served the lotus feet of Narada, and thus the Prince
perfectly understood transcendental subjects in truth (sa-tattvah). The word sa-tattvah means that
Priyavrata knew all the facts about the spirit soul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the
relationship between the spirit soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he also knew all about
this material world and the relationship of the spirit soul and the Supreme Lord within the material world.
Thus the Prince decided to engage himself only in rendering service to the Lord.
When Priyavrata's father, Svayambhuva Manu, requested him to accept the responsibility of ruling over
the world, he did not welcome the suggestion. This is the symptom of a great, liberated devotee. Even
though engaged in worldly affairs, he does not take pleasure in them, but remains always absorbed in the
Lord's service. While thus serving the Lord, he deals externally with worldly affairs without being
affected. For example, although he has no attraction for his children, he cares for them and educates them
to become devotees. Similarly, he speaks to his wife with affectionate words, but he is not attached to her.
By rendering devotional service, a devotee acquires all the good qualities of the Supreme Lord. Lord Krsna
had sixteen thousand wives, all of them very beautiful, and although He dealt with each of them as a
beloved husband, He was not attracted or attached to any of them. In the same way, although a devotee
may enter family life and act very affectionately toward his wife and children, he is never attached to these
activities.
This verse states that by serving the lotus feet of his spiritual master, prince Priyavrata very soon
attained the perfectional stage of Krsna consciousness. This is the only way to advance in spiritual life. As
stated in the Vedas:
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"If one has unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord and the spiritual master, the essence of all Vedic
knowledge is revealed to him. (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23) A devotee always thinks of the Lord
continuously. While chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, the words Krsna and Hare immediately remind him
of all the Lord's activities. Since his entire life is engaged in the service of the Lord, a devotee cannot
forget the Lord at any time. Just as an ordinary man always engages his mind in material activities, a
devotee always engages his mind in spiritual activities. This is called brahma-satra, or meditating upon the
Supreme Lord always. Prince Priyavrata was perfectly initiated into this practice by Sri Narada.
