<h2>Translation</h2>
The seven islands [varsas] are named according to the names of those seven sons--Siva, Yavasa,
Subhadra, Santa, Ksema, Amrta and Abhaya. In those seven tracts of land, there are seven mountains and
seven rivers. The mountains are named Manikuta, Vajrakuta, Indrasena, Jyotisman, Suparna,
Hiranyasthiva and Meghamala, and the rivers are named Aruna, Nrmna, Angirasi, Savitri, Suptabhata,
Rtambhara and Satyambhara. One can immediately be free from material contamination by touching or
bathing in those rivers, and the four castes of people who live in Plaksadvipa--the Hamsas, Patangas,
Urdhvayanas and Satyangas--purify themselves in that way. The inhabitants of Plaksadvipa live for one
thousand years. They are beautiful like the demigods, and they also beget children like the demigods. By
completely performing the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas and by worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as represented by the sun-god, they attain the sun, which is a heavenly planet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to general understanding, there are originally three deities--Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and
Lord Siva--and people with a poor fund of knowledge consider Lord Visnu no better than Lord Brahma or
Lord Siva. This conclusion, however, is invalid. As stated in the Vedas, istapurtam bahudha jayamanam
visvam bibharti bhuvanasya nabhih tad evagnis tad vayus tat suryas tad u candramah agnih sarvadaivatah.
This means that the Supreme Lord, who accepts and enjoys the results of Vedic ritualistic ceremonies
(technically called istapurta), who maintains the entire creation, who supplies the necessities of all living
entities (eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman) and who is the central point of all creation, is Lord Visnu.
Lord Visnu expands as the demigods known as Agni, Vayu, Surya and Candra, who are simply parts and
parcels of His body. Lord Krsna says in Srimad Bhagavad-gita (9.23):
ye 'py anya-devata-bhakta
yajante sraddhayanvitah
te 'pi mam eva kaunteya
yajanty avidhi-purvakam
"Devotees who worship the demigods with firm faith worship Me also, but not according to regulative
principles." In other words, if one worships the demigods but does not understand the relationship
between the demigods and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his worship is irregular. Krsna also says
in Bhagavad-gita (9.24), aham hi sarva-yajnanam bhokta ca prabhur eva ca: "I am the only enjoyer of
ritualistic ceremonies."
It may be argued that the demigods are as important as Lord Visnu because the names of the demigods
are different names of Visnu. This, however, is not a sound conclusion, for it is contradicted in the Vedic
literatures. The Vedas declare:
candrama manaso jatas caksoh suryo ajayata; srotradayas ca pranas ca mukhad agnir ajayata; narayanad
brahma, narayanad rudro jayate, narayanat prajapatih jayate, narayanad indro jayate, narayanad astau
vasavo jayante, narayanad ekadasa rudra jayante.
"The demigod of the moon, Candra, came from the mind of Narayana, and the sun-god came from His
eyes. The controlling deities of hearing and the life air came from Narayana, and the controlling deity of
fire was generated from His mouth. Prajapati, Lord Brahma, came from Narayana, Indra came from
Narayana, and the eight Vasus, the eleven expansions of Lord Siva and the twelve Adityas also came from
Narayana." In the smrti Vedic literature it is also said:
brahma sambhus tathaivarkas
candramas ca satakratuh
evam adyas tathaivanye
yukta vaisnava-tejasa
jagat-karyavasane tu
viyujyante ca tejasa
vitejas ca te sarve
pancatvam upayanti te
"Brahma, Sambhu, Surya and Indra are all merely products of the power of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is also true of the many other demigods whose names are not mentioned here. When the
cosmic manifestation is annihilated, these different expansions of Narayana's potencies will merge into
Narayana. In other words, all these demigods will die. Their living force will be withdrawn, and they will
merge into Narayana."
Therefore it should be concluded that Lord Visnu, not Lord Brahma or Lord Siva, is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As a government officer is sometimes accepted as the entire government although
he is actually but a departmental manager, so the demigods, having achieved power of attorney from
Visnu, act on His behalf, although they are not as powerful as He. All the demigods must work under the
orders of Visnu. Therefore it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya. The only master is Lord Krsna, or
Lord Visnu, and all others are His obedient servants, who act exactly according to His orders. The
distinction between Lord Visnu and the demigods is also expressed in Bhagavad-gita (9.25). Yanti devavrata
devan. .. yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam: those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the
demigods, whereas the worshipers of Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu go to the planets in Vaikuntha. These
are the statements of the smrti. Therefore the idea that Lord Visnu is on the same level as the demigods is
in contradiction to the sastras. The demigods are not supreme. The supremacy of the demigods is
dependent on the mercy of Lord Narayana (Visnu, or Krsna).
