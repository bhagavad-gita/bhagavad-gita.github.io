<h2>Text</h2>
mukto 'pi tavad bibhryat sva-deham
arabdham asnann abhimana-sunyah
yathanubhutam pratiyata-nidrah
kim tv anya-dehaya gunan na vrnkte
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
muktah--a liberated person; api--even; tavat--so long; bibhryat--must maintain; sva-deham--his own
body; arabdham--obtained as a result of past activity; asnan--accepting; abhimana-sunyah--without
erroneous conceptions; yatha--as; anubhutam--what was perceived; pratiyata-nidrah--one who has
awakened from sleep; kim tu--but; anya-dehaya--for another material body; gunan--the material qualities;
na--never; vrnkte--enjoys.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even if one is liberated, he nevertheless accepts the body he has received according to his past karma.
Without misconceptions, however, he regards his enjoyment and suffering due to that karma the way an
awakened person regards a dream he had while sleeping. He thus remains steadfast and never works to
achieve another material body under the influence of the three modes of material nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The difference between a liberated and conditioned soul is that the conditioned soul is under the
concept of bodily life, whereas a liberated person knows that he is not the body but a spirit, different from
the body. Priyavrata might have thought that although a conditioned soul is forced to act according to the
laws of nature, why should he, who was far advanced in spiritual understanding, accept the same kind of
bondage and impediments to spiritual advancement? To answer this doubt, Lord Brahma informed him
that even those who are liberated do not resent accepting, in the present body, the results of their past
activities. While sleeping, one dreams many unreal things, but when he awakens he disregards them and
makes progress in factual life. Similarly, a liberated person--one who has completely understood that he is
not the body but a spirit soul--disregards past activities performed in ignorance and performs his present
activities in such a way that they produce no reactions. This is described in Bhagavad-gita (3.9).
Yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: if one performs activities for the satisfaction of
the Supreme Personality, the yajna-purusa, his work does not produce reactions, whereas karmis, who act
for themselves, are bound by the reactions of their work. A liberated person, therefore, does not think
about whatever he has ignorantly done in the past; instead, he acts in such a way that he will not produce
another body by fruitive activities. As clearly mentioned in Bhagavad-gita:
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." (Bg. 14.26) Regardless
of what we have done in our past lives, if we engage ourselves in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord
in this life, we will always be situated in the brahma-bhuta (liberated) state, free from reactions, and will
not be obliged to accept another material body. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna (Bg.
4.9). After giving up the body, one who has acted in that way does not accept another material body, but
instead goes back home, back to Godhead.
