<h2>Translation</h2>
At the time of death, the King saw that the deer was sitting by his side, exactly like his own son, and was
lamenting his death. Actually the mind of the King was absorbed in the body of the deer, and
consequently--like those bereft of Krsna consciousness--he left the world, the deer, and his material body
and acquired the body of a deer. However, there was one advantage. Although he lost his human body
and received the body of a deer, he did not forget the incidents of his past life.
PURPORT
There was a difference between Bharata Maharaja's acquiring a deer body and others' acquiring different
bodies according to their mental condition at the time of death. After death, others forget everything that
has happened in their past lives, but Bharata Maharaja did not forget. According to Bhagavad-gita:
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail."
(Bg. 8.6)
After quitting his body, a person gets another body according to his mental condition at the time of
death. At death, a person always think; of that subject matter in which he has been engrossed during his
life. According to this law, because Bharata Maharaja was always thinking of the deer and forgetting his
worship of the Supreme Lord, he acquired the body of a deer. However, due to his having been elevated to
the topmost platform of devotional service, he did not forget the incidents of his past life. This special
benediction saved him from further deterioration. Due to his past activities in devotional service, he
became determined to finish his devotional service even in the body of a deer. It is therefore said in this
verse, mrtam, although he had died, anu, afterwards, na mrta janmanusmrtir itaravat, he did not forget
the incidents of his past life as others forget them. As stated in Brahma-samhita: karmani nirdahati kintu
ca bhakti-bhajam (Brahma-samhita 5.54). It is proved herein that due to the grace of the Supreme Lord, a
devotee is never vanquished. Due to his willful neglect of devotional service, a devotee may be punished
for a short time, but he again revives his devotional service and returns home. back to Godhead.
