<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
athanayapi na bhavata ijyayoru-bhara-bharaya samucitam artham ihopalabhamahe.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--otherwise; anaya--this; api--even; na--not; bhavatah--of Your exalted personality; ijyaya--by
performance of sacrifice; urubhara-bharaya--encumbered by much paraphernalia; samucitam--required;
artham--use; iha--here; upalabhamahe--we can see.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We have engaged in Your worship with many things and have offered sacrifices unto You, but we think
that there is no need for so many arrangements to please Your Lordship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Rupa Gosvami says that if one is offered varied foods but has no appetite, the offering has no value.
In a big sacrificial ceremony there may be many things accumulated to satisfy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but if there is no devotion, attachment or love for the Lord, the arrangement is useless. The
Lord is complete in Himself, and He does not need anything from us. However, if we offer Him a little
water, a flower and a tulasi leaf, He will accept them. Bhakti, devotional service, is the main way to satisfy
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not a question of arranging huge sacrifices. The priests were
regretful, thinking that they were not on the path of devotional service and that their sacrifice was not
pleasing to the Lord.
