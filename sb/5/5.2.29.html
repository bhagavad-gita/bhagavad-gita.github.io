<h2>Translation</h2>
After Kavi, Mahavira and Savana were completely trained in the paramahamsa stage of life, Maharaja
Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. Whenever he was determined to fix his arrow
upon his bowstring with his two powerful arms, all opponents of the regulative principles of religious life
would flee from his presence in fear of the unparalleled prowess he displayed in ruling the universe. He
greatly loved his wife Barhismati, and with the increase of days, their exchange of nuptial love also
increased. By her feminine behavior as she dressed herself, walked, got up, smiled, laughed, and glanced
about, Queen Barhismati increased his energy. Thus although he was a great soul, he appeared lost in the
feminine conduct of his wife. He behaved with her just like an ordinary man, but actually he was a great
soul.
PURPORT
In this verse, the word dharma-pratipaksah ("opponents of religious principles") refers not to a
particular faith, but to varnasrama-dharma, the division of society, socially and spiritually, into four
varnas (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and four asramas (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and
sannyasa). To maintain proper social order and help the citizens gradually progress toward the goal of
life--namely spiritual understanding--the principles of varnasrama-dharma must be accepted. From this
verse, Maharaja Priyavrata appears to have been so strict in maintaining this institution of varnasramadharma
that anyone neglecting it would immediately flee from his presence as soon as the King warned
him by fighting or administering light punishment. Indeed, Maharaja Priyavrata would not have to fight,
for simply because of his strong determination, they dared not disobey the rules and regulations of
varnasrama-dharma. It is said that unless human society is regulated by varnasrama-dharma, it is no
better than a bestial society of cats and dogs. Maharaja Priyavrata, therefore, strictly maintained
varnasrama-dharma by his extraordinary, unparalleled prowess.
To maintain such a life of strict vigilance, one needs encouragement from his wife. In the varnasramadharma
system, certain classes, such as the brahmanas and sannyasis, do not need encouragement from
the opposite sex. Ksatriyas and grhasthas, however, actually need the encouragement of their wives in
order to execute their duties. Indeed, a grhastha or ksatriya cannot properly execute his responsibilities
without the association of his wife. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu personally admitted that a grhastha must
live with a wife. Ksatriyas were even allowed to have many wives to encourage them in discharging the
duties of government. The association of a good wife is necessary in a life of karma and political affairs. To
execute his duties properly, therefore. Maharaja Priyavrata took advantage of his good wife Barhismati,
who was always very expert in pleasing her great husband by properly dressing herself, smiling, and
exhibiting her feminine bodily features. Queen Barhismati always kept Maharaja Priyavrata very
encouraged, and thus he executed his governmental duty very properly. In this verse iva has twice been
used to indicate that Maharaja Priyavrata acted exactly like a henpecked husband and thereby seemed to
have lost his sense of human responsibility. Actually, however, he was fully conscious of his position as a
spirit soul, although he seemingly behaved like an acquiescent karmi husband. Maharaja Priyavrata thus
ruled the universe for eleven arbudas of years. One arbuda consists of 100,000,000 years, and Maharaja
Priyavrata ruled the universe for eleven such arbudas.
