<h2>Translation</h2>
The personal weapon used by Lord Krsna, the disc, is called hari-cakra, the disc of Hari. This cakra is
the wheel of time. It expands from the beginning of the atoms up to the time of Brahma's death, and it
controls all activities. It is always revolving and spending the lives of the living entities, from Lord Brahma
down to an insignificant blade of grass. Thus one changes from infancy, to childhood, to youth and
maturity, and thus one approaches the end of life. It is impossible to check this wheel of time. This wheel
is very exacting because it is the personal weapon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the
conditioned soul, fearing the approach of death, wants to worship someone who can save him from
imminent danger. Yet he does not care for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose weapon is the
indefatigable time factor. The conditioned soul instead takes shelter of a man-made god described in
unauthorized scriptures. Such gods are like buzzards, vultures, herons and crows. Vedic scriptures do not
refer to them. Imminent death is like the attack of a lion, and neither vultures, buzzards, crows nor
herons can save one from such an attack. One who takes shelter of unauthorized man-made gods cannot
be saved from the clutches of death.
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is stated: harim vina mrtim na taranti. No one can save himself from the cruel hands of death without
being favored by Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated, mam eva ye
prapadyante mayam etam taranti te: whoever fully surrenders unto Krsna can be saved from the cruel
hands of material nature. The conditioned soul, however, sometimes wants to take shelter of a demigod,
man-made god, pseudo incarnation or bogus svami or yogi. All these cheaters claim to follow religious
principles, and all this has become very popular in this age of Kali. There are many pasandis who, without
referring to the sastras, pose themselves as incarnations, and foolish people follow them. Krsna, the
Supreme personality of Godhead, has left behind Him Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. Not
referring to these authorized scriptures, rascals take shelter of man-made scriptures and try to compete
with Lord Krsna. That is the greatest difficulty one encounters when trying to promote spiritual
consciousness in human society. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying its best to bring people
back to Krsna consciousness in its pure form, but the pasandis and atheists, who are cheaters, are so
numerous that sometimes we become perplexed and wonder how to push this movement forward. In any
case, we cannot accept the unauthorized ways of so-called incarnations, gods, cheaters and bluffers, who
are described here as crows, vultures, buzzards and herons.
