<h2>Translation</h2>
Situated 8,800,000 miles above Saturn, or 20,800,000 miles above earth, are the seven saintly sages, who
are always thinking of the well-being of the inhabitants of the universe. They circumambulate the
supreme abode of Lord Visnu, known as Dhruvaloka, the polestar.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Madhvacarya quotes the following verse from the Brahmanda Purana:
jnananandatmano visnuh
sisumara-vapusy atha
urdhva-lokesu sa vyapta
adityadyas tad-asrita
Lord Visnu, who is the source of knowledge and transcendental bliss, has assumed the form of Sisumara
in the seventh heaven, which is situated in the topmost level of the universe. All the other planets,
beginning with the sun, exist under the shelter of this Sisumara planetary system.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Orbits of the Planets."
Chapter Twenty-three
The Sisumara Planetary Systems
This chapter describes how all the planetary systems take shelter of the polestar, Dhruvaloka. It also
describes the totality of these planetary systems to be Sisumara, another expansion of the external body of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhruvaloka, the abode of Lord Visnu within this universe, is
situated 1,300,000 yojanas from the seven stars. In the planetary system of Dhruvaloka are the planets of
the fire-god, Indra, Prajapati, Kasyapa and Dharma, all of whom are very respectful to the great devotee
Dhruva, who lives on the polestar. Like bulls yoked to a central pivot, all the planetary systems revolve
around Dhruvaloka, impelled by eternal time. Those who worship the virat-purusa, the universal form of
the Lord, conceive of this entire rotating system of planets as an animal known as sisumara. This
imaginary sisumara is another form of the Lord. The head of the sisumara form is downward, and its body
appears like that of a coiled snake. On the end of its tail is Dhruvaloka, on the body of the tail are
Prajapati, Agni, Indra and Dharma, and on the root of the tail are Dhata and Vidhata. On its waist are the
seven great sages. The entire body of the sisumara faces toward its right and appears like a coil of stars.
On the right side of this coil are the fourteen prominent stars from Abhijit to Punarvasu, and on the left
side are the fourteen prominent stars from Pusya to Uttarasadha. The stars known as Punarvasu and
Pusya are on the right and left hips of the sisumara, and the stars known as Ardra and Aslesa are on the
right and left feet of the sisumara. Other stars are also fixed on different sides of the Sisumara planetary
system according to the calculations of Vedic astronomers. To concentrate their minds, yogis worship the
Sisumara planetary system, which is technically known as the kundalini-cakra.
