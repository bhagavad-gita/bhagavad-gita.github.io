magara-daratmaja-vitta-bandhusu

yah prana-vrttya paritusta atmavan
siddhyaty aduran na tathendriya-priyah
<br>

ma--not; agara--house; dara--wife; atma-ja--children; vitta--bank balance; bandhusu--among friends and
relatives; sangah--association or attachment; yadi--if; syat--there must be; bhagavat-priyesu--among
persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear; nah--of us; yah--anyone who; pranavrttya--
by the bare necessities of life; paritustah--satisfied; atma-van--who has controlled his mind and

a person attached to sense gratification.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, we pray that we may never feel attraction for the prison of family life, consisting of home,
wife, children, friends, bank balance, relatives and so on. If we do have some attachment, let it be for
devotees, whose only dear friend is Krsna. A person who is actually self-realized and who has controlled
his mind is perfectly satisfied with the bare necessities of life. He does not try to gratify his senses. Such a
person quickly advances in Krsna consciousness, whereas others, who are too attached to material things,
find advancement very difficult.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu was requested to explain the duty of a Vaisnava, a Krsna
conscious person, He immediately said, asat-sanga-tyaga--ei vaisnava-acara. The first business of a
Vaisnava is to give up the association of persons who are not devotees of Krsna and who are too attached
to material things--wife, children, bank balance and so on. Prahlada Maharaja also prays to the Personality
of Godhead that he may avoid the association of nondevotees attached to the materialistic way of life. If he
must be attached to someone, he prays to be attached only to a devotee.
A devotee is not interested in unnecessarily increasing the demands of the senses for gratification. Of
course, as long as one is in this material world, one must have a material body, and it must be maintained
for executing devotional service. The body can be maintained very easily by eating krsna-prasada. As
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." Why should the
menu be unnecessarily increased for the satisfaction of the tongue? Devotees should eat as simply as
possible. Otherwise, attachment for material things will gradually increase, and the senses, being very
strong, will soon require more and more material enjoyment. Then the real business of life--to advance in
Krsna consciousness--will stop.
