TRANSLATION
In this way, being purified by ritualistic sacrifices, the heart of Maharaja Bharata was completely
uncontaminated. His devotional service unto Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, increased day after day. Lord Krsna,
the son of Vasudeva, is the original Personality of Godhead manifest as the Supersoul [Paramatma] as well
as the impersonal Brahman. Yogis meditate upon the localized Paramatma situated in the heart, jnanis
worship the impersonal Brahman as the Supreme Absolute Truth, and devotees worship Vasudeva, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose transcendental body is described in the sastras. His body is
decorated with the Srivatsa, the Kaustubha jewel and a flower garland, and His hands hold a conchshell,
disc, club and lotus flower. Devotees like Narada always think of Him within their hearts.
PURPORT
Lord Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna, the son of Vasudeva, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is
manifest within the hearts of yogis in His Paramatma feature, and He is worshiped as impersonal Brahman
by jnanis. The Paramatma feature is described in the sastras as having four hands, holding disc,
conchshell, lotus flower and club. As confirmed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.2.8):
kecit sva-dehantar-hrdayavakase
pradesa-matram purusam vasantam
catur-bhujam kanja-rathanga-sankhagada-
dharam dharanaya smaranti
Paramatma is situated in the hearts of all living beings. He has four hands, which hold four symbolic
weapons. All devotees who think of the Paramatma within the heart worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as the temple Deity. They also understand the impersonal features of the Lord and His bodily
rays, the Brahman effulgence.
