<h2>Text</h2>
graharksataramayam adhidaivikam
papapaham mantra-krtam tri-kalam
namasyatah smarato va tri-kalam
nasyeta tat-kalajam asu papam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
graha-rksa-tara-mayam--consisting of all the planets and stars; adhidaivikam--the leader of all the
demigods; papa-apaham--the killer of sinful reactions; mantra-krtam--of those who chant the mantra
mentioned above; tri-kalam--three times; namasyatah--offering obeisances; smaratah--meditating; va--or;
tri-kalam--three times; nasyeta--destroys; tat-kala-jam--born at that time; asu--very quickly; papam--all
sinful reactions.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The body of the Supreme Lord, Visnu, which forms the Sisumara-cakra, is the resting place of all the
demigods and all the stars and planets. One who chants this mantra to worship that Supreme Person three
times a day--morning, noon and evening--will surely be freed from all sinful reactions. If one simply offers
his obeisances to this form or remembers this form three times a day, all his recent sinful activities will be
destroyed.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Summarizing the entire description of the planetary systems of the universe, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says that one who is able to meditate upon this arrangement as the virat-rupa, or visva-rupa, the
external body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worship Him three times a day by meditation
will always be free from all sinful reactions. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura estimates that Dhruvaloka,
the polestar, is 3,800,000 yojanas above the sun. Above Dhruvaloka by 10,000,000 yojanas is Maharloka,
above Maharloka by 20,000,000 yojanas is Janaloka, above Janaloka by 80,000,000 yojanas is Tapoloka,
and above Tapoloka by 120,000,000 yojanas is Satyaloka. Thus the distance from the sun to Satyaloka is
233,800,000 yojanas, or 1,870,400,000 miles. The Vaikuntha planets begin 26,200,000 yojanas
(209,600,000 miles) above Satyaloka. Thus the Visnu Purana describes that the covering of the universe is
260,000,000 yojanas (2,080,000,000 miles) away from the sun. The distance from the sun to the earth is
lower planetary systems called Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala and Patala. Below these
lower planets by 30,000 yojanas, Sesa Naga is lying on the Garbhodaka Ocean. That ocean is 249,800,000
yojanas deep. Thus the total diameter of the universe is approximately 500,000,000 yojanas, or
4,000,000,000 miles.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports to the Fifth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Sisumara planetary System."
Chapter Twenty-four
The Subterranean Heavenly Planets
This chapter describes the planet Rahu, which is 10,000 yojanas (80,000 miles) below the sun, and it
also describes Atala and the other lower planetary systems. Rahu is situated below the sun and moon. It is
between these two planets and the earth. When Rahu conceals the sun and moon, eclipses occur, either
total or partial, depending on whether Rahu moves in a straight or curving way.
Below Rahu by another 1,000,000 yojanas are the planets of the Siddhas, Caranas and Vidyadharas, and
below these are planets such as Yaksaloka and Raksaloka. Below these planets is the earth, and 70,000
yojanas below the earth are the lower planetary systems--Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala, Rasatala
and Patala. Demons and Raksasas live in these lower planetary systems with their wives and children,
always engaged in sense gratification and not fearing their next births. The sunshine does not reach these
planets, but they are illuminated by jewels fixed upon the hoods of snakes. Because of these shining gems
there is practically no darkness. Those living in these planets do not become old or diseased, and they are
not afraid of death from any cause but the time factor, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the planet Atala, the yawning of a demon has produced three kinds of women, called svairini
(independent), kamini (lusty) and pumscali (very easily subdued by men). Below Atala is the planet
Vitala, wherein Lord Siva and his wife Gauri reside. Because of their presence, a kind of gold is produced
called hataka. Below Vitala is the planet Sutala, the abode of Bali Maharaja, the most fortunate king. Bali
Maharaja was favored by the Supreme personality of Godhead, Vamanadeva, because of his intense
devotional service. The Lord went to the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaja and begged him for three paces
of land, and on this plea the Lord took from him all his possessions. When Bali Maharaja agreed to all
this, the Lord was very pleased, and therefore the Lord serves as his doorkeeper. The description of Bali
Maharaja appears in the Eighth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead offers a devotee material happiness, this is not His real
favor. The demigods, who are very puffed up by their material opulence, pray to the Lord only for
material happiness, not knowing anything better. Devotees like Prahlada Maharaja, however, do not want
material happiness. Not to speak of material happiness, they do not want even liberation from material
bondage, although one can achieve this liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, even
with improper pronunciation.
Below Sutala is the planet Talatala, the abode of the demon Maya. This demon is always materially
happy because he is favored by Lord Siva, but he cannot achieve spiritual happiness at any time. Below
Talatala is the planet Mahatala, where there are many snakes with hundreds and thousands of hoods.
Below Mahatala is Rasatala, and below that is Patala, where the serpent Vasuki lives with his associates.
