tasmad bhavanto hrdayena jatah
sarve mahiyamsam amum sanabham
aklista-buddhya bharatam bhajadhvam
susrusanam tad bharanam prajanam
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore (because I am the Supreme); bhavantah--you; hrdayena--from My heart; jatah--born;
sarve--all; mahiyamsam--the best; amum--that; sa-nabham--brother; aklista-buddhya--with your
intelligence, without material contamination; bharatam--Bharata; bhajadhvam--just try to serve;
susrusanam--service; tat--that; bharanam prajanam--ruling over the citizens.
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear boys, you are all born of My heart, which is the seat of all spiritual qualities. Therefore you
should not be like materialistic and envious men. You should accept your eldest brother, Bharata, who is
exalted in devotional service. If you engage yourselves in Bharata's service, your service to him will
include My service, and you will rule the citizens automatically.
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word hrdaya indicates the heart, which is also called urah, the chest. The heart is
situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is
actually born from within the heart. According to the heart's situation. the semen takes the form of a
body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified
through the ritualistic ceremony known as garbhadhana. Rsabhadeva's heart was always uncontaminated
and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of Rsabhadeva were spiritually inclined.
Nonetheless. Rsabhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve
him. All the brothers of Bharata Maharaja were advised by Rsabhadeva to adhere to Bharata's service. The
question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised
that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, mahiyasam padarajo-'
bhiseka--one has to serve the mahiyan, one who is very spiritually advanced. Mahat-sevam dvaram
ahur vimukteh: by serving the mahat, the exalted devotee, one's path for liberation is open. The family of
Rsabhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Maharaja, Rsabhadeva's
eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his
pleasure. That was to be their duty.
The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Maharaja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan
of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kuruksetra, we find that Lord Krsna wanted Maharaja Yudhisthira to
be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the
previous verse, Lord Rsabhadeva's heart is hrdayam yatra dharmah. The characteristic dharma is also
explained in Bhagavad-gita: surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect dharma
(paritranaya sadhunam). the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything
goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes
chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in
general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the
right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant sudras; therefore
another sudra is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly
followed the principles of Bhagavad-gita, they would elect a person who is the Lord's devotee. Then
automatically there would be good government. Rsabhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Maharaja as
the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always
represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for
everyone.

<h2>Translation</h2>
Of the two energies manifest [spirit and dull matter], beings possessing living force [vegetables, grass,
trees and plants] are superior to dull matter [stone, earth, etc.]. Superior to nonmoving plants and
vegetables are worms and snakes, which can move. Superior to worms and snakes are animals that have
developed intelligence. Superior to animals are human beings, and superior to human beings are ghosts
because they have no material bodies. Superior to ghosts are the Gandharvas, and superior to them are the
Siddhas. Superior to the Siddhas are the Kinnaras, and superior to them are the asuras. Superior to the
asuras are the demigods, and of the demigods, Indra, the King of heaven, is supreme. Superior to Indra are
the direct sons of Lord Brahma, sons like King Daksa, and supreme among Brahma's sons is Lord Siva.
Since Lord Siva is the son of Lord Brahma, Brahma is considered superior, but Brahma is also subordinate
to Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because I am inclined to the brahmanas, the brahmanas are
best of all.
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the brahmanas are given a position superior to that of the Supreme Lord. The idea is that
the government should be conducted under the guidance of the brahmanas. Although Rsabhadeva
recommended His eldest son, Bharata, as emperor of the earth, he still had to follow the instructions of
the brahmanas in order to govern the world perfectly. The Lord is worshiped as brahmanya-deva. The
Lord is very fond of devotees, or brahmanas. This does not refer to so-called caste brahmanas, but to
qualified brahmanas. A brahmana should be qualified with the eight qualities mentioned in text 24, such
as sama, dama, satya and titiksa. The brahmanas should always be worshiped. and under their guidance
the ruler should discharge his duty and rule the citizens. Unfortunately, in this age of Kali, the executive
is not selected by very intelligent people, nor is he guided by qualified brahmanas. Consequently, chaos
results. The mass of people should be educated in Krsna consciousness so that according to the
democratic process they can select a first-class devotee like Bharata Maharaja to head the government. If
the head of the state is headed by qualified brahmanas, everything is completely perfect.
In this verse, the evolutionary process is indirectly mentioned. The modern theory that life evolves from
matter is to some extent supported in this verse because it is stated, bhutesu virudbhyah. That is, the
living entities evolve from vegetables, grass, plants and trees, which are superior to dull matter. In other
words, matter also has the potency to manifest living entities in the form of vegetables. In this sense, life
comes out of matter, but matter also comes out of life. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham
sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate: "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.
Everything emanates from Me."
There are two energies--material and spiritual--and both originally come from Krsna. Krsna is the
supreme living being. Although it may be said that in the material world a living force is generated from
matter, it must be admitted that originally matter is generated from the supreme living being. Nityo
nityanam cetanas cetananam. The conclusion is that everything, both material and spiritual, is generated
from the Supreme Being. From the evolutionary point of view, perfection is reached when the living entity
attains the platform of a brahmana. A brahmana is a worshiper of the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme
Brahman worships the brahmana. In other words, the devotee is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and
the Lord is inclined to see to the satisfaction of His devotee. A brahmana is called dvija-deva, and the Lord
is called dvija-deva-deva. He is the Lord of brahmanas.
The evolutionary process is also explained in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya, Chapter Nineteen), wherein
it is said that there are two types of living entities--moving and nonmoving. Among moving entities. there
are birds, beasts. aquatics, human beings and so on. Of these. the human beings are supposed to be the
best, but they are few. Of these small numbers of human beings, there are many low-class human beings
like mlecchas, Pulindas, bauddhas and sabaras. The human being elevated enough to accept the Vedic
principles is superior. Among those who accept the Vedic principles generally known as varnasrama
(presently known as the Hindu system), few actually follow these principles. Of those who actually follow
the Vedic principles, most perform fruitive activity or pious activity for elevation to a high position.
Manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye: out of many attached to fruitive activity, one may be a
jnani--that is, one philosophically inclined and superior to the karmis. Yatatam api siddhanam kascin
mam vetti tattvatah: out of many jnanis, one may be liberated from material bondage, and out of many
millions of liberated jnanis, one may become a devotee of Krsna.
