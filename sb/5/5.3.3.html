<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Visnu appeared before King Nabhi with four arms. He was very bright, and He appeared to be the
best of all personalities. Around the lower portion of His body, He wore a yellow silken garment. On His
chest was the mark of Srivatsa, which always displays beauty. He carried a conchshell, lotus flower, disc
and club, and He wore a garland of forest flowers and the Kaustubha gem. He was beautifully decorated
with a helmet, earrings, bangles, belt, pearl necklace, armlets, ankle bells and other bodily ornaments
bedecked with radiant jewels. Seeing the Lord present before them, King Nabhi and his priests and
associates felt just like poor people who have suddenly attained great riches. They received the Lord and
respectfully bent their heads and offered Him things in worship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is distinctly mentioned here that the Supreme Personality of Godhead did not appear as an ordinary
human being. He appeared before King Nabhi and his associates as the best of all personalities
(Purusottama). As stated in the Vedas: Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead is also a living being, but He is the supreme living being. In Bhagavad-gita (7.7), Lord Krsna
Himself says. mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: "O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is
no truth superior to Me." No one is more attractive or more authoritative than Lord Krsna. That is one of
the differences between God and an ordinary living being. According to this description of the
transcendental body of Lord Visnu, the Lord can easily be distinguished from all other living beings.
Consequently Maharaja Nabhi and his priests and associates all offered the Lord obeisances and began to
worship Him with various things. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.22), yam labdhva caparam labham
manyate nadhikam tatah. That is, "Upon gaining this, one thinks that there is no greater gain." When one
realizes God and sees the Lord face to face, one certainly thinks that he has gained the best of all things.
Raso 'py asya param drstva nivartate: when one experiences a higher taste, his consciousness is fixed.
After seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one ceases to be attracted by anything material. One
then remains steady in his worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
