<h2>Translation</h2>
It is a fact, however, that these innocent people carrying your palanquin without payment are certainly
suffering due to this injustice. Their condition is very lamentable because you have forcibly engaged them
in carrying your palanquin. This proves that you are cruel and unkind, yet due to false prestige you were
thinking that you were protecting the citizens. This is ludicrous. You were such a fool that you could not
have been adored as a great man in an assembly of persons advanced in knowledge.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Rahugana was proud of being king, and he felt he had the right to control the citizens as he liked,
but actually he was engaging men in carrying his palanquin without payment, and therefore he was
causing them trouble without reason. Nonetheless, the King was thinking that he was the protector of the
citizens. Actually the king should be the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For this
reason he is called nara-devata, the Lord among human beings. However, when a king thinks that because
he is the head of the state, he can utilize the citizens for his sense gratification, he is in error. Such an
attitude is not appreciated by learned scholars. According to the Vedic principles, the king should be
advised by learned sages, brahmanas and scholars, who advise him according to the injunctions given in
the dharma-sastra. The duty of the king is to follow these instructions. Learned circles do not appreciate
the king's utilizing public endeavor for his own benefit. His duty is to give protection to the citizens
instead. The king should not become such a rogue that he exploits the citizens for his own benefit.
It is stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam that in Kali-yuga the heads of government will be plunderers and
thieves. These thieves and plunderers take the money and property of the public by force or connivance.
Therefore it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam, rajanyair nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih. As Kali-yuga advances,
we can see that these characteristics are already visible. We can certainly imagine how deteriorated human
civilization will be by the end of Kali-yuga. Indeed, there will no longer be a sane man capable of
understanding God and our relationship with Him. In other words, human beings will be just like
animals. At that time, in order to reform human society, Lord Krsna will come in the form of the Kalki
avatara. His business will be to kill all the atheists because ultimately the real protector is Visnu, or Krsna.
The Lord incarnates and sets things in order when things are mismanaged by so-called kings and heads
of government. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita, yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata. Of course
this takes many years, but the principle is there. When the king or governmental head does not follow the
proper principles, nature deals out the punishments in the forms of war, famine and so forth. Therefore if
the governmental head is not aware of life's goal, he should not take charge of ruling the people. Actually
the supreme proprietor of everything is Lord Visnu. He is the maintainer of everyone. The king, the
father, and the guardian are simply representatives of Lord Visnu, empowered by Him to look after the
management and maintain things. It is therefore the duty of the head of the state to maintain the general
populace in such a way that people will ultimately know the goal of life. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi
visnum. Unfortunately the foolish governmental head and the general populace do not know that the
ultimate goal of life is to understand and approach Lord Visnu. Without this knowledge, everyone is in
ignorance, and all society is crowded with cheaters and cheated.
