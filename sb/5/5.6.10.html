<h2>Text</h2>

the most condemned men; deva-maya-mohitah--bewildered by the external energy, or illusory
energy, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sva-vidhi-niyoga-sauca-caritra-vihinah--without
character, cleanliness, and the rules and regulations given according to one's own duty in life; devahelanani--

hair; kalina--by the age of Kali; adharma-bahulena--with an abundance of irreligion; upahata-dhiyah--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
People who are lowest among men and bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord will give
up the original varnasrama-dharma and its rules and regulations. They will abandon bathing three times
daily and worshiping the Lord. Abandoning cleanliness and neglecting the Supreme Lord, they will accept
nonsensical principles. Not regularly bathing or washing their mouths regularly, they will always remain
unclean, and they will pluck out their hair. Following a concocted religion, they will flourish. During this
age of Kali, people are more inclined to irreligious systems. Consequently these people will naturally
deride Vedic authority, the followers of Vedic authority, the brahmanas, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Presently the hippies in the Western countries fit this description. They are irresponsible and
unregulated. They do not bathe, and they deride standard Vedic knowledge. They concoct new life-styles
and religions. There are many hippie groups at the present moment, but they all originated from King
Arhat, who imitated the activities of Lord Rsabhadeva, who was situated on the paramahamsa stage. King
Arhat did not care for the fact that although Lord Rsabhadeva acted like a madman, His stool and urine
were nonetheless aromatic, so much so that they nicely scented the countryside for miles around. The
followers of King Arhat went under the name Jains, and they were later followed by many others,
particularly by the hippies, who are more or less offshoots of Mayavada philosophy because they think
themselves the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such people do not respect the real followers of Vedic
principles, the ideal brahmanas. Nor do they have respect for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
Supreme Brahman. Due to the influence of this age of Kali, they are apt to concoct false religious systems.
