dravya--by physical objects; sva-bhava--by nature as the cause of development; asaya--by culture;

mind; vikarah--transformations; sahasrasah--in thousands; satasah--in hundreds; kotisah ca--and in

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The physical elements, nature, the original cause, culture, destiny and the time element are all material
causes. Agitated by these material causes, the eleven functions transform into hundreds of functions and
then into thousands and then into millions. But all these transformations do not take place automatically
by mutual combination. Rather, they are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One should not think that all the interactions of the physical elements, gross and subtle. that cause the
transformation of mind and consciousness are working independently. They are under the direction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita (15.15), Krsna says that the Lord is situated in
everyone's heart (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca). As mentioned
herein, Supersoul (ksetrajna) is directing everything. The living entity is also ksetrajna, but the supreme
ksetrajna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the witness and order giver. Under His direction,
everything takes place. The different inclinations of the living entity are created by his own nature or his
expectations, and he is trained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the agency of material
nature. The body, nature and the physical elements are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. They do not function automatically. Nature is neither independent nor automatic. As confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is behind nature.

"This material nature is working under My direction. O son of Kunti. and it is producing all moving and
unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." (Bg. 9.10)
