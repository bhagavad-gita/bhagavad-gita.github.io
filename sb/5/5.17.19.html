<h2>Text</h2>
striyo vratais tva hrsikesvaram svato
hy aradhya loke patim asasate 'nyam
tasam na te vai paripanty apatyam
priyam dhanayumsi yato 'sva-tantrah
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
striyah--all women; vrataih--by observing fasting and other vows; tva--you; hrsikesvaram--the Supreme
personality of Godhead, master of the senses; svatah--of your own accord; hi--certainly; aradhya--
worshiping; loke--in the world; patim--a husband; asasate--ask for; anyam--another; tasam--of all those

very dear; dhana--the wealth; ayumsi--or the duration of life; yatah--because; asva-tantrah--dependent.
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are certainly the fully independent master of all the senses. Therefore all women who
worship You by strictly observing vows because they wish to acquire a husband to satisfy their senses are
surely under illusion. They do not know that such a husband cannot actually give protection to them or
their children. Nor can he protect their wealth or duration of life, for he himself is dependent on time,
fruitive results and the modes of nature, which are all subordinate to You.
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, Laksmidevi (Rama) shows compassion toward women who worship the Lord for the
benediction of possessing a good husband. Although such women desire to be happy with children,
wealth, a long duration of life and everything dear to them, they cannot possibly do so. In the material
world, a so-called husband is dependent on the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are
many examples of a woman whose husband, being dependent on the result of his own fruitive actions,
cannot maintain his wife, her children, her wealth or her duration of life. Therefore, factually the only real
husband of all women is Krsna, the supreme husband. Because the gopis were liberated souls, they
understood this fact. Therefore they rejected their material husbands and accepted Krsna as their real
husband. Krsna is the real husband not only of the gopis, but of every living entity. Everyone should
perfectly understand that Krsna is the real husband of all living entities, who are described in the
Bhagavad-gita as prakrti (female), not purusa (male). In Bhagavad-gita (10.12), only Krsna is addressed as
purusa:
param brahma param dhama
pavitram paramam bhavan
purusam sasvatam divyam
adi-devam ajam vibhum
"You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and
the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn
and all-pervading beauty."
Krsna is the original purusa, and the living entities are prakrti. Thus Krsna is the enjoyer, and all living
entities are meant to be enjoyed by Him. Therefore any woman who seeks a material husband for her
protection, or any man who desires to become the husband of a woman, is under illusion. To become a
husband means to maintain a wife and children nicely by supplying wealth and security. However, a
material husband cannot possibly do this, for he is dependent on his karma. Karmana-daiva-netrena: his
circumstances are determined by his past fruitive activities. Therefore if one proudly thinks he can protect
his wife, he is under illusion. Krsna is the only husband, and therefore the relationship between a
husband and wife in this material world cannot be absolute. Because we have the desire to marry, Krsna
mercifully allows the so-called husband to possess a wife, and the wife to possess a so-called husband, for
mutual satisfaction. In the Isopanisad it is said, tena tyaktena bhunjitha: the Lord provides everyone with
his quota. Actually, however, every living entity is prakrti, or female, and Krsna is the only husband.
ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
(Cc. Adi 5.142)
Krsna is the original master or husband of everyone, and all other living entities, having taken the form
of so-called husbands, or wives, are dancing according to His desire. A so-called husband may unite with
his wife for sense gratification, but his senses are conducted by Hrsikesa, the master of the senses, who is
therefore the actual husband.
