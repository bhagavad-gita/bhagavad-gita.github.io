<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by associating with exalted devotees, anyone can attain perfection of knowledge and with the
sword of knowledge can cut to pieces the illusory associations within this material world. Through the
association of devotees, one can engage in the service of the Lord by hearing and chanting [sravanam
kirtanam]. Thus one can revive his dormant Krsna consciousness and, sticking to the cultivation of Krsna
consciousness, return home, back to Godhead, even in this life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To become liberated from material bondage, one must give up the association of worldly people and
accept the association of devotees. positive and negative processes are mentioned in this regard. Through
the association of devotees, one develops Krsna consciousness, which is dormant within. This Krsna
consciousness movement is giving this chance to everyone. We are giving shelter to everyone who is
serious about progressing in Krsna consciousness. We arrange for their lodging and board so that they can
peacefully cultivate Krsna consciousness and return home, back to Godhead, even in this life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twelfth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "The Conversation Between Maharaja Rahugana and Jada Bharata."
Chapter Thirteen
Further Talks Between King Rahugana and Jada Bharata
The brahmana Jada Bharata became very kind to King Rahugana, and to disassociate him from the
material world, he spoke figuratively of the forest of the material world. He explained that this material
world is like a great forest in which one becomes entangled due to association with material life. In this
forest there are plunderers (the six senses) as well as carnivorous animals like jackals, wolves and lions
(wife, children and other relatives) who are always anxious to suck the blood from the head of the family.
The forest plunderers and the carnivorous blood-sucking animals combine to exploit the energy of a man
within this material world. In this forest there is also a black hole, covered by grass, into which one may
fall. Coming into the forest and being captivated by so many material attractions, one identifies himself
with this material world, society, friendship, love and family. Having lost the path and not knowing where
to go, being harassed by animals and birds, one is also victimized by many desires. Thus one works very
hard within the forest and wanders here and there. He becomes captivated by temporary happiness and
becomes aggrieved by so-called distress. Actually one simply suffers in the forest from so-called happiness
and distress. Sometimes he is attacked by a snake (deep sleep), and due to the snakebite he loses
consciousness and becomes puzzled and bewildered about discharging his duties. Sometimes he is
attracted by women other than his wife, and thus be thinks he enjoys extramarital love with another
woman. He is attacked by various diseases, by lamentation and by summer and winter. Thus one within
the forest of the material world suffers the pains of material existence. Expecting to become happy, the
living entity changes his position from one place to another, but actually a materialistic person within the
material world is never happy. Being constantly engaged in materialistic activities, he is always disturbed.
He forgets that one day he has to die. Although he suffers severely, being illusioned by the material
energy, he still hankers after material happiness. In this way he completely forgets his relationship with
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
By hearing this from Jada Bharata, Maharaja Rahugana revived his Krsna consciousness and thus
benefited from Jada Bharata's association. He could understand that his illusion was over, and he begged
pardon from Jada Bharata for his misbehavior. All this was told to Maharaja Pariksit by Sukadeva
Gosvami.
