<h2>Translation</h2>
Even though in the body of a deer, Maharaja Bharata did not forget the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; therefore when he was giving up the body of a deer, he loudly uttered the following prayer:
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sacrifice personified. He gives the results of ritualistic activity.
He is the protector of religious systems, the personification of mystic yoga, the source of all knowledge,
the controller of the entire creation, and the Supersoul in every living entity. He is beautiful and attractive.
I am quitting this body offering obeisances unto Him and hoping that I may perpetually engage in His
transcendental loving service." Uttering this, Maharaja Bharata left his body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The entire Vedas are meant for the understanding of karma, jnana and yoga--fruitive activity,
speculative knowledge and mystic yoga. Whatever way of spiritual realization we accept, the ultimate goal
is Narayana, the Supreme personality of Godhead. The living entities are eternally connected with Him via
devotional service. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, ante narayana-smrtih: the perfection of life is to
remember Narayana at the time of death. Although Bharata Maharaja had to accept the body of a deer, he
could remember Narayana at the time of death. Consequently he took birth as a perfect devotee in a
brahmana family. This confirms the statement of Bhagavad-gita (6.41), sucinam srimatam gehe yogabhrasto
'bhijayate: "One who falls from the path of self-realization takes birth in a family of brahmanas or
wealthy aristocrats." Although Maharaja Bharata appeared in the royal family, he became neglectful and
took birth as a deer. Because he was very cautious within his deer body, he took birth in a brahmana
family as Jada Bharata. During this lifetime, he remained perfectly Krsna conscious and preached the
gospel of Krsna consciousness directly, beginning with his instructions to Maharaja Rahugana. In this
regard, the word yogaya is very significant. The purpose of astanga-yoga, as stated by Madhvacarya, is to
link or connect with the Supreme personality of Godhead. The goal is not to display some material
perfections.
