<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: As soon as the Lord was born as the son of Maharaja Nabhi, He manifested
symptoms of the Supreme Lord, such as marks on the bottoms of His feet [the flag, thunderbolt, etc.].
This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful. He could control His senses and His mind, and,
possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment. Endowed with all these attributes, the
son of Maharaja Nabhi became more powerful day after day. Due to this, the citizens, learned brahmanas,
demigods and ministers wanted Rsabhadeva to be appointed ruler of the earth.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In these days of cheap incarnations, it is very interesting to note the bodily symptoms found in an
incarnation. From the very beginning of His birth, it was observed that Rsabhadeva's feet were marked
with the transcendental signs (a flag, thunderbolt, lotus flower, etc.). In addition to this, as the Lord
began to grow, He became very prominent. He was equal to everyone. He did not favor one person and
neglect another. An incarnation of God must have the six opulences--wealth. strength, knowledge, beauty,
fame and renunciation. It is said that although Rsabhadeva was endowed with all opulences, He was not at
all attached to material enjoyment. He was self-controlled and therefore liked by everyone. Due to His
superexcellent qualities, everyone wanted Him to rule the earth. An incarnation of God has to be accepted
by experienced people and by the symptoms described in the sastras. An incarnation is not accepted
simply by the adulation of foolish people.
