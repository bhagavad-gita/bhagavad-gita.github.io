TRANSLATION
All the demigods and their exalted qualities, such as religion, knowledge and renunciation, become
manifest in the body of one who has developed unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Vasudeva. On the other hand, a person devoid of devotional service and engaged in material
activities has no good qualities. Even if he is adept at the practice of mystic yoga or the honest endeavor of
maintaining his family and relatives, he must be driven by his own mental speculations and must engage
in the service of the Lord's external energy. How can there be any good qualities in such a man?
PURPORT
As explained in the next verse, Krsna is the original source of all living entities. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (15.7), wherein Krsna says:
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." All living entities are part and
parcel of Krsna, and therefore when they revive their original Krsna consciousness, they possess all the
good qualities of Krsna in a small quantity. When one engages himself in the nine processes of devotional
service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atmanivedanam),
one's heart becomes purified, and he immediately understands his relationship with Krsna.
He then revives his original quality of Krsna consciousness.
In the Adi-lila of Caitanya-caritamrta, Chapter Eight, there is a description of some of the qualities of
devotees. For example, Sri Pandita Haridasa is described as being very well-behaved, tolerant, peaceful,
magnanimous and grave. In addition, he spoke very sweetly, his endeavors were very pleasing, he was
always patient, he respected everyone, he always worked for everyone's benefit, his mind was free of
duplicity, and he was completely devoid of all malicious activities. These are all originally qualities of
Krsna, and when one becomes a devotee they automatically become manifest. Sri Krsnadasa Kaviraja, the
author of Caitanya-caritamrta, says that all good qualities become manifest in the body of a Vaisnava and
that only by the presence of these good qualities can one distinguish a Vaisnava from a non-Vaisnava.
Krsnadasa Kaviraja lists the following twenty-six good qualities of a Vaisnava: (1) He is very kind to
everyone. (2) He does not make anyone his enemy. (3) He is truthful. (4) He is equal to everyone. (5) No
one can find any fault in him. (6) He is magnanimous. (7) He is mild. (8) He is always clean. (9) He is
without possessions. (10) He works for everyone's benefit. (11) He is very peaceful. (12) He is always
surrendered to Krsna. (13) He has no material desires. (14) He is very meek. (15) He is steady. (16) He
controls his senses. (17) He does not eat more than required. (18) He is not influenced by the Lord's
illusory energy. (19) He offers respect to everyone. (20) He does not desire any respect for himself. (21)
He is very grave. (22) He is merciful. (23) He is friendly. (24) He is poetic. (25) He is expert. (26) He is
silent.
