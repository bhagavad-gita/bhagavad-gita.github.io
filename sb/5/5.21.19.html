<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, in his orbit through Bhu-mandala, the sun-god traverses a distance of 95,100,000 yojanas
[760,800,000 miles] at the speed of 2,000 yojanas and two krosas [16,004 miles] in a moment.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "The Movements of the Sun."
Chapter Twenty-two
The Orbits of the Planets
In this chapter the orbits of the planets are described. According to the movements of the moon and
other planets, all the inhabitants of the universe are prone to auspicious and inauspicious situations. This
is referred to as the influence of the stars.
The sun-god, who controls the affairs of the entire universe, especially in regard to heat, light, seasonal
changes and so on, is considered an expansion of Narayana. He represents the three Vedas--Rg, Yajur and
Sama--and therefore he is known as Trayimaya, the form of Lord Narayana. Sometimes the sun-god is also
called Surya Narayana. The sun-god has expanded himself in twelve divisions, and thus he controls the
six seasonal changes and causes winter, summer, rain and so on. Yogis and karmis following the
varnasrama institution, who practice hatha or astanga-yoga or who perform agnihotra sacrifices, worship
Surya Narayana for their own benefit. The demigod Surya is always in touch with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Narayana. Residing in outer space, which is in the middle of the universe, between Bhuloka
and Bhuvarloka, the sun rotates through the time circle of the zodiac, represented by twelve rasis, or
signs, and assumes different names according to the sign he is in. For the moon, every month is divided
into two fortnights. Similarly, according to solar calculations, a month is equal to the time the sun spends
in one constellation; two months constitute one season, and there are twelve months in a year. The entire
area of the sky is divided into two halves, each representing an ayana, the course traversed by the sun
within a period of six months. The sun travels sometimes slowly, sometimes swiftly and sometimes at a
moderate speed. In this way it travels within the three worlds, consisting of the heavenly planets, the
earthly planets and outer space. These orbits are referred to by great learned scholars by the names
Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvatsara and Vatsara.
The moon is situated 100,000 yojanas above the rays of the sunshine. Day and night on the heavenly
planets and Pitrloka are calculated according to its waning and waxing. Above the moon by a distance of
200,000 yojanas are some stars, and above these stars is Sukra-graha (Venus), whose influence is always
auspicious for the inhabitants of the entire universe. Above Sukra-graha by 200,000 yojanas is Budhagraha
(Mercury), whose influence is sometimes auspicious and sometimes inauspicious. Next, above
Budha-graha by 200,000 yojanas, is Angaraka (Mars), which almost always has an unfavorable influence.
Above Angaraka by another 200,000 yojanas is the planet called Brhaspati-graha (Jupiter), which is
always very favorable for qualified brahmanas. Above Brhaspati-graha is the planet Sanaiscara (Saturn),
which is very inauspicious, and above Saturn is a group of seven stars occupied by great saintly persons
who are always thinking of the welfare of the entire universe. These seven stars circumambulate
Dhruvaloka, which is the residence of Lord Visnu within this universe.
