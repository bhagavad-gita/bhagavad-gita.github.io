<h2>Text</h2>
na nunam mukta-sanganam
tadrsanam dvijarsabha
grhesv abhiniveso 'yam
pumsam bhavitum arhati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; nunam--certainly; mukta-sanganam--who are free from attachment; tadrsanam--such; dvijarsabha--
O greatest of the brahmanas; grhesu--to family life; abhinivesah--excessive attachment; ayam--
this; pumsam--of persons; bhavitum--to be; arhati--is possible.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Devotees are certainly liberated persons. Therefore, O greatest of the brahmanas, they cannot possibly
be absorbed in family affairs.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is said that by executing devotional service to the Lord, one can
understand the transcendental position of the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood by any means except bhakti. The Lord confirms
this in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.21). Bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: "only by executing devotional service
can one appreciate Me." Similarly, in Bhagavad-gita (18.55) Lord Krsna says, bhaktya mam abhijanati:
"simply by discharging devotional service, one can understand Me." Thus for a bhakta to become attached
to family affairs is impossible, since a bhakta and his associates are liberated. Everyone is searching after
ananda, or bliss, but in the material world there can never be any bliss. It is only possible in devotional
service. Attachment for family affairs and devotional service are incompatible. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit
was somewhat surprised to hear that Maharaja Priyavrata was simultaneously attached to devotional
service and to family life.
