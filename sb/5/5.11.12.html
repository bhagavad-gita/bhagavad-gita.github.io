<h2>Translation</h2>
The individual soul bereft of Krsna consciousness has many ideas and activities created in the mind by
the external energy. They have been existing from time immemorial. Sometimes they are manifest in the
wakening state and in the dream state, but during deep sleep [unconsciousness] or trance, they disappear.
A person who is liberated in this life [jivan-mukta] can see all these things vividly.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.3), ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata. There are two
kinds of ksetrajna, or living beings. One is the individual living being, and the other is the supreme living
being. The ordinary living being knows about his body to some extent, but the Supreme, Paramatma,
knows the condition of all bodies. The individual living being is localized, and the Supreme. Paramatma.
is all-pervading. In this sloka the word ksetrajna refers to an ordinary living being, not the supreme living
being. This ordinary living being is of two kinds--nitya-baddha or nitya-mukta. One is eternally
conditioned and the other eternally liberated. The eternally liberated living being; are in the Vaikuntha
jagat, the spiritual world, and they never fall into the material world. Those in the material world are
conditioned souls, nitya-baddha. The nitya-baddhas can become liberated by controlling the mind
because the cause of conditioned life is the mind. When the mind is trained and the soul is not under the
mind's control, the soul can be liberated even in this material world. When it is liberated, one is called
jivan-mukta. A jivan-mukta knows how he has become conditioned; therefore he tries to purify himself
and return home, back to Godhead. The eternally conditioned soul is eternally conditioned because he is
controlled by the mind. The conditioned state and liberated state are compared to the sleeping,
unconscious state and the awakened state. Those who are sleeping and unconscious are eternally
conditioned, but those who are awake understand that they are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Therefore even in this material world, they engage in Krsna's service. As
confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami: iha yasya harer dasye. If one takes to Krsna's service, he is liberated,
even though he appears to be a conditioned soul within the material world. Jivan-muktah sa ucyate. In
any condition, one is to be considered liberated if his only business is to serve Krsna.
