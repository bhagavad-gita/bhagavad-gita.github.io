<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
etavad anuvada-paribhasaya pratyudirya muni-vara upasama-sila uparatanatmya-nimitta upabhogena
karmarabdham vyapanayan raja-yanam api tathovaha.
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sukadeva Gosvami continued to speak; etavat--so much; anuvada-paribhasaya--by
explanatory repetition of words spoken previously by the King; pratyudirya--giving replies one after
another; muni-varah--great sage Jada Bharata; upasama-silah--who was calm and peaceful in character;
uparata--ceased; anatmya--things not related to the soul; nimittah--whose cause (ignorance) for
identification with things not related to the soul; upabhogena--by accepting the consequences of his
karma; karma-arabdham--the resultant action now attained; vyapanayan--finishing; raja-yanam--the
palanquin of the King; api--again; tatha--as before; uvaha--continued to carry.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Maharaja Pariksit, when King Rahugana chastised the exalted devotee Jada
Bharata with harsh words, that peaceful, saintly person tolerated it all and replied properly. Nescience is
due to the bodily conception, and Jada Bharata was not affected by this false conception. Out of his
natural humility, he never considered himself a great devotee, and he agreed to suffer the results of his
past karma. Like an ordinary man, he thought that by carrying the palanquin, he was destroying the
reactions of his past misdeeds. Thinking in this way, he began to carry the palanquin as before.
<h2>Purport</h2>
An exalted devotee of the Lord never thinks that he is a paramahamsa or a liberated person. He always
remains a humble servant of the Lord. In all reverse conditions, he agrees to suffer the results of his past
life. He never accuses the Lord of putting him into a distressed condition. These are the signs of an
exalted devotee. Tat te 'nukampam susamiksyamanah. When suffering reversed conditions, the devotee
always considers that the reverse conditions are the Lord's concessions. He is never angry with his master;
he is always satisfied with the position his master offers. In any case, he continues performing his duty in
devotional service. Such a person is guaranteed promotion back home, back to Godhead. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
"My dear Lord, one who constantly waits for Your causeless mercy to be bestowed upon him and who
goes on suffering the reactions of his past misdeeds, offering You respectful obeisances from the core of
his heart. is surely eligible for liberation, for it has become his rightful claim."
