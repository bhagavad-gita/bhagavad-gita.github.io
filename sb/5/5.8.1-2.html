<h2>Translation</h2>
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after giving up the body of a deer, Bharata Maharaja
took birth in a very pure brahmana family. There was a brahmana who belonged to the dynasty of Angira.
He was fully qualified with brahminical qualifications. He could control his mind and senses, and he had
studied the Vedic literatures and other subsidiary literatures. He was expert in giving charity, and he was
always satisfied, tolerant, very gentle, learned and nonenvious. He was self-realized and engaged in the
devotional service of the Lord. He remained always in a trance. He had nine equally qualified sons by his
first wife, and by his second wife he begot twins--a brother and a sister, of which the male child was said
to be the topmost devotee and foremost of saintly kings--Bharata Maharaja. This, then, is the story of the
birth he took after giving up the body of a deer.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bharata Maharaja was a great devotee, but he did not attain success in one life. In Bhagavad-gita it is said
that a devotee who does not fulfill his devotional duties in one life is given the chance to be born in a fully
qualified brahmana family or a rich ksatriya or vaisya family. Sucinam srimatam gehe (Bg. 6.41). Bharata
Maharaja was the firstborn son of Maharaja Rsabha in a rich ksatriya family, but due to his willful
negligence of his spiritual duties and his excessive attachment to an insignificant deer, he was obliged to
take birth as the son of a deer. However, due to his strong position as a devotee, he was gifted with the
remembrance of his past life. Being repentant, he remained in a solitary forest and always thought of
Krsna. Then he was given the chance to take birth in a very good brahmana family.
