<h2>Text</h2>
yad u ha vava tava punar adabhra-kartar iha samahutas tatrartha-dhiyam mandanam nas tad yad devahelanam
deva-devarhasi samyena sarvan prativodhum avidusam.
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--because; u ha vava--indeed; tava--Your; punah--again; adabhra-kartah--O Lord, who performs many
activities; iha--here, in this arena of sacrifice; samahutah--invited; tatra--therefore; artha-dhiyam--who
aspire to fulfill material desires; mandanam--not very intelligent; nah--of us; tat--that; yat--which; devahelanam--
disrespect of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; deva-deva--Lord of lords; arhasi--please;
samyena--because of Your equipoised position; sarvan--everything; prativodhum--tolerate; avidusam--of
us, who are all ignorant.
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, You perform many wonderful activities. Our only aim was to acquire a son by performing this
great sacrifice; therefore our intelligence is not very sharp. We are not experienced in ascertaining life's
goal. By inviting You to this negligible sacrifice for some material motive, we have certainly committed a
great offense at Your lotus feet. Therefore, O Lord of lords, please excuse our offense because of Your
causeless mercy and equal mind.
<h2>Purport</h2>
The priests were certainly unhappy to have called the Supreme Lord from Vaikuntha for such an
insignificant reason. A pure devotee never wants to see the Lord unnecessarily. The Lord is engaged in
various activities, and the pure devotee does not want to see Him whimsically, for his own sense
gratification. The pure devotee simply depends on the Lord's mercy, and when the Lord is pleased, he can
see Him face to face. The Lord is unseen even by demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. By calling on
the Supreme Lord, the priests of Nabhi Maharaja proved themselves unintelligent; nonetheless, the Lord
came out of His causeless mercy. All of them therefore wanted to be excused by the Lord.
Worship of the Supreme Lord for material gain is not approved by authorities. As stated in Bhagavadgita
(7.16):
catur-vidha bhajante mam
janah sukrtino 'rjuna
arto jijnasur artharthi
jnani ca bharatarsabha
"O best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me--the
distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute."
Initiation into bhakti begins when one is in a distressed condition or in want of money, or when one is
inquisitive to understand the Absolute Truth. Nonetheless, people who approach the Supreme Lord in
this way are not actually devotees. They are accepted as pious (sukrtinah) due to their inquiring about the
Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not knowing the various activities and
engagements of the Lord, such people unnecessarily disturb the Lord for material gain. However, the Lord
is so kind that even though disturbed, He fulfills the desires of such beggars. The pure devotee is
anyabhilasita-sunya; he has no motive behind his worship. He is not conducted by the influence of maya
in the form of karma or jnana. The pure devotee is always prepared to execute the order of the Lord
without personal consideration. The rtvijah, the priests at the sacrifice, knew very well the distinction
between karma and bhakti, and because they considered themselves under the influence of karma, fruitive
activity, they begged the Lord's pardon. They knew that the Lord had been invited to come for some
paltry reason.
