<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami then said to Maharaja Pariksit: O Visnudatta, those who already know that the soul
is separate from the body, who are liberated from the invincible knot in the heart, who are always engaged
in welfare activities for all living entities and who never contemplate harming anyone are always protected
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who carries His disc [the Sudarsana cakra] and acts as supreme
time to kill the demons and protect His devotees. The devotees always take shelter at the lotus feet of the
Lord. Therefore at all times, even if threatened by decapitation, they remain unagitated. For them, this is
not at all wonderful.
<h2>Purport</h2>
These are some of the great qualities of a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First, a
devotee is firmly convinced of his spiritual identity. He never identifies with the body; he is firmly
convinced that the spirit soul is different from the body. Consequently he fears nothing. Even though his
life may be threatened, he is not at all afraid. He does not even treat an enemy like an enemy. Such are the
qualifications of devotees. Devotees are always fully dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and the Lord is always eager to give them all protection in all circumstances.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Supreme Character of Jada Bharata."
Chapter Ten
The Discussion Between Jada Bharata and Maharaja Rahugana
In this chapter Bharata Maharaja, now Jada Bharata, was successfully accepted by King Rahugana, ruler
of the states known as Sindhu and Sauvira. The King forced Jada Bharata to carry his palanquin and
chastised him because he did not carry it properly. A carrier of King Rahugana's palanquin was needed,
and to fulfill this need the chief carriers found Jada Bharata as the most likely person to do the work. He
was therefore forced to carry the palanquin. Jada Bharata, however, did not protest this proud order, but
humbly accepted the job and carried the palanquin. While carrying it, however, he was very careful to see
that he did not step on an ant, and whenever he saw one, he would stop until the ant had passed. Because
of this, he could not keep pace with the other carriers. The King within the palanquin became very
disturbed and chastised Jada Bharata with filthy language, but Jada Bharata, being completely freed from
the bodily conception, did not protest; he proceeded carrying the palanquin. When he continued as
before, the King threatened him with punishment, and being threatened by the King, Jada Bharata began
to talk. He protested against the filthy language used by the King when the King chastised him, and the
King, hearing the instructions of Jada Bharata, was awakened to his real knowledge. When he came to his
consciousness, he understood that he had offended a great, learned and saintly person. At that time he
very humbly and respectfully prayed to Jada Bharata. He now wanted to understand the deep meaning of
the philosophical words used by Jada Bharata, and with great sincerity, he begged his pardon. He admitted
that if one offends the lotus feet of a pure devotee, he is certainly punished by the trident of Lord Siva.
