<h2>Translation</h2>
Remaining in that asrama, the great King Bharata Maharaja was now very careful not to fall victim to
bad association. Without disclosing his past to anyone, he remained in that asrama and ate dry leaves
only. He was not exactly alone, for he had the association of the Supersoul. In this way he waited for
death in the body of a deer. Bathing in that holy place, he finally gave up that body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Holy places like Vrndavana, Hardwar, Prayaga and Jagannatha Puri are especially meant for the
execution of devotional service. Vrndavana specifically is the most exalted and preferred holy place for
Vaisnava devotees of Lord Krsna who are aspiring to return back to Godhead, the Vaikuntha planets.
There are many devotees in Vrndavana who regularly bathe in the Yamuna, and this cleanses all the
contamination of the material world. By constantly chanting and hearing the holy names and pastimes of
the Supreme Lord, one certainly becomes purified and becomes a fit candidate for liberation. However, if
one purposefully falls victim to sense gratification, he has to be punished, at least for one lifetime, like
Bharata Maharaja.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "A Description of the Character of Bharata Maharaja."
Chapter Nine
The Supreme Character of Jada Bharata
In this chapter Bharata Maharaja's attainment of the body of a brahmana is described. In this body he
remained like one dull, deaf and dumb, so much so that when he was brought before the goddess Kali to
be killed as a sacrifice, he never protested but remained silent. After having given up the body of a deer,
he took birth in the womb of the youngest wife of a brahmana. In this life he could also remember the
activities of his past life, and in order to avoid the influence of society, he remained like a deaf and dumb
person. He was very careful not to fall down again. He did not mix with anyone who was not a devotee.
This process should be adopted by every devotee. As advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: asat-sangatyaga--
ei vaisnava-acara. One should strictly avoid the company of nondevotees, even though they may be
family members. When Bharata Maharaja was in the body of a brahmana, the people in the neighborhood
thought of him as a crazy, dull fellow, but within he was always chanting and remembering Vasudeva, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although his father wanted to give him an education and purify him as
a brahmana by offering him the sacred thread, he remained in such a way that his father and mother
could understand that he was crazy and not interested in the reformatory method. Nonetheless, he
remained fully Krsna conscious, even without undergoing such official ceremonies. Due to his silence,
some people who were no better than animals began to tease him in many ways, but he tolerated this.
After the death of his father and mother, his stepmother and stepbrothers began to treat him very poorly.
They would give him the most condemned food. but still he did not mind; he remained completely
absorbed in Krsna consciousness. He was ordered by his stepbrothers and mother to guard a paddy field
one night, and at that time the leader of a dacoit party took him away and tried to kill him by offering him
as a sacrifice before Bhadra Kali. When the dacoits brought Bharata Maharaja before the goddess Kali and
raised a chopper to kill him, the goddess Kali became immediately alarmed due to the mistreatment of a
devotee. She came out of the deity and, taking the chopper in her own hands, killed all the dacoits there.
Thus a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can remain silent despite the mistreatment of
nondevotees. Rogues and dacoits who misbehave toward a devotee are punished at last by the
arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
