TRANSLATION
In these eight varsas, or tracts of land, human beings live ten thousand years according to earthly
calculations. All the inhabitants are almost like demigods. They have the bodily strength of ten thousand
elephants. Indeed, their bodies are as sturdy as thunderbolts. The youthful duration of their lives is very
pleasing, and both men and women enjoy sexual union with great pleasure for a long time. After years of
sensual pleasure--when a balance of one year of life remains--the wife conceives a child. Thus the
standard of pleasure for the residents of these heavenly regions is exactly like that of the human beings
who lived during Treta-yuga.
PURPORT
There are four yugas: Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga, Dvapara-yuga and Kali-yuga. During the first yuga, Satyayuga,
people were very pious. Everyone practiced the mystic yoga system for spiritual understanding and
realization of God. Because everyone was always absorbed in samadhi, no one was interested in material
sense enjoyment. During Treta-yuga, people enjoyed sense pleasure without tribulations. Material
miseries began in Dvapara-yuga, but they were not very stringent. Stringent material miseries really began
from the advent of Kali-yuga.
Another point in this verse is that in all eight of these heavenly varsas, although men and women enjoy
sex pleasure, there is no pregnancy. Pregnancy takes place only in lower-grade life. For example, animals
like dogs and hogs become pregnant twice a year, and each time they beget at least half a dozen offspring.
Even lower species of life such as snakes give birth to hundreds of young at one time. This verse informs
us that in grades of life higher than ours, pregnancy occurs once in a lifetime. People still have sex life,
but there is no pregnancy. In the spiritual world, people are not very attracted to sex life, due to their
exalted devotional attitude. Practically speaking, there is no sex life in the spiritual world, but even if
sometimes it does occur, there is no pregnancy at all. On the planet earth, however, human beings do
become pregnant, although the tendency is to avoid having children. In this sinful age of Kali, people
have even taken to the process of killing the child in the womb. This is the most degraded practice; it can
only perpetuate the miserable material conditions of those who perform it.
