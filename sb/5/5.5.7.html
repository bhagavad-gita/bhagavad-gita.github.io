<h2>Text</h2>
yada na pasyaty ayatha guneham
svarthe pramattah sahasa vipascit
gata-smrtir vindati tatra tapan
asadya maithunyam agaram ajnah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; na--not; pasyati--sees; ayatha--unnecessary; guna-iham--endeavor to satisfy the senses; svaarthe--
in self-interest; pramattah--mad; sahasa--very soon; vipascit--even one advanced in knowledge;
gata-smrtih--being forgetful; vindati--gets; tatra--there; tapan--material miseries; asadya--getting;
maithunyam--based on sexual intercourse; agaram--a home; ajnah--being foolish.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even though one may be very learned and wise, he is mad if he does not understand that the endeavor
for sense gratification is a useless waste of time. Being forgetful of his own interest, he tries to be happy in
the material world, centering his interests around his home, which is based on sexual intercourse and
which brings him all kinds of material miseries. In this way one is no better than a foolish animal.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the lowest stage of devotional life, one is not an unalloyed devotee. Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnanakarmady-
anavrtam: to be an unalloyed devotee, one must be freed from all material desires and
untouched by fruitive activity and speculative knowledge. On the lower platform, one may sometimes be
interested in philosophical speculation with a tinge of devotion. However, at that stage one is still
interested in sense gratification and is contaminated by the modes of material nature. The influence of
maya is so strong that even a person advanced in knowledge actually forgets that he is Krsna's eternal
servant. Therefore he remains satisfied in his householder life, which is centered around sexual
intercourse. Conceding to a life of sex, he agrees to suffer all kinds of material miseries. Due to ignorance,
one is thus bound by the chain of material laws.
