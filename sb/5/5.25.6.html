<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King of the pitas is Yamaraja, the very powerful son of the sun-god. He resides in Pitrloka with his
personal assistants and, while abiding by the rules and regulations set down by the Supreme Lord, has his
agents, the Yamadutas, bring all the sinful men to him immediately upon their death. After bringing them
within his jurisdiction, he properly judges them according to their specific sinful activities and sends
them to one of the many hellish planets for suitable punishments.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Yamaraja is not a fictitious or mythological character; he has his own abode, Pitrloka, of which he is
king. Agnostics may not believe in hell, but Sukadeva Gosvami affirms the existence of the Naraka
planets, which lie between the Garbhodaka Ocean and Patalaloka. Yamaraja is appointed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead to see that the human beings do not violate His rules and regulations. As
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.17):
karmano hy api boddhavyam
boddhavyam ca vikarmanah
akarmanas ca boddhavyam
gahana karmano gatih
"The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action
is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is. "One should understand the nature of karma, vikarma
and akarma, and one must act accordingly. This is the law of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
conditioned souls, who have come to this material world for sense gratification, are allowed to enjoy their
senses under certain regulative principles. If they violate these regulations, they are judged and punished
by Yamaraja. He brings them to the hellish planets and properly chastises them to bring them back to
Krsna consciousness. By the influence of maya, however, the conditioned souls remain infatuated with the
mode of ignorance. Thus in spite of repeated punishment by Yamaraja, they do not come to their senses,
but continue to live within the material condition, committing sinful activities again and again.
