dear Priyavrata; duhkham--distress; sukham--happiness; va--or; guna-karma--with quality and work;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Priyavrata, according to our association with different modes of material nature, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead gives us our specific bodies and the happiness and distress we achieve. One must
therefore remain situated as he is and be conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as a
blind man is led by a person who has eyes with which to see.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By material means, one cannot avoid the happiness and distress unique to his particular body. There are
8,400,000 bodily forms, each destined to enjoy and suffer a certain amount of happiness and distress. This
we cannot change, for the happiness and distress are ordained by the Supreme personality of Godhead, in
accordance with whose decision we have received our bodies. Since we cannot avoid the plan of the
Supreme Godhead, we must agree to be directed by Him, just as a blind man is led by a person who has
eyes. Under any circumstances, if we remain in the condition allotted to us by the Supreme Lord and
follow His instructions, we will become perfect. The main purpose of life is to follow the instructions of
the Supreme personality of Godhead. It is such instructions that constitute one's religion or occupational
duty.
In Bhagavad-gita, therefore, Lord Krsna says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give
up all other engagements. Simply surrender unto Me and follow Me." (Bg. 18.66) This process of
surrendering by following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not meant for any
particular caste or creed. A brahmana can surrender, and so can a ksatriya, vaisya or sudra. Everyone can
adopt this process. As stated in this verse, caksusmatandha iva niyamanah: one should follow the Lord the
way a blind man follows a person who has eyes. If we follow the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
following the directions He gives in the Vedas and Bhagavad-gita, our lives will be successful. The Lord
therefore says:
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo 'si me
"Always think of Me, become My devotee, and offer respect and obeisances unto Me. Then you will
certainly come back home, back to Godhead. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend."
(Bg. 18.65) This instruction is meant for everyone--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra. If anyone, from
any division of life, surrenders to the Supreme personality of Godhead and follows His instructions, his
life will be successful.
The previous verse has given the analogy of bulls moving under the direction of the driver of a bullock
cart. The bulls, being completely surrendered to the driver, remain wherever he wants to place them and
eat whatever he wants them to eat. Similarly, being completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, we should not aspire for happiness, or regret distress; we must be satisfied with the position
allotted to us by the Lord. We should follow the path of devotional service and not be dissatisfied with the
happiness and distress He has given. People in the material modes of passion and ignorance generally
cannot understand the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with its 8,400,000 forms of life, but
the human form affords one the special privilege to understand this plan, engage in devotional service and
elevate oneself to the highest position of perfection by following the Lord's instructions. The entire world
is working under the influence of the modes of material nature, especially ignorance and passion, but if
people engage in hearing and chanting about the glories of the Supreme Lord, their lives can be
successful, and they can be elevated to the highest perfection. In the Brhan-naradiya Purana, therefore, it
is said:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of Kali, there is no other way, no other way, no other way for spiritual perfection than the
holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord." Everyone should be given the chance to hear the
holy names of the Supreme personality of Godhead, for thus one will gradually come to understand his
real position in life and be elevated to the transcendental position above the mode of goodness. Thus all
impediments to his progress will be cut to pieces. In conclusion, therefore, we must be satisfied in
whatever position we have been put into by the Supreme personality of Godhead, and we should try to
engage ourselves in His devotional service. Then our lives will be successful.
