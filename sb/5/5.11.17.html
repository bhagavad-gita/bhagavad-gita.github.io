<h2>Translation</h2>
This uncontrolled mind is the greatest enemy of the living entity. If one neglects it or gives it a chance,
it will grow more and more powerful and will become victorious. Although it is not factual, it is very
strong. It covers the constitutional position of the soul. O King, please try to conquer this mind by the
weapon of service to the lotus feet of the spiritual master and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Do
this with great care.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is one easy weapon with which the mind can be conquered--neglect. The mind is always telling us
to do this or that; therefore we should be very expert in disobeying the mind's orders. Gradually the mind
should be trained to obey the orders of the soul. It is not that one should obey the orders of the mind.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura used to say that to control the mind one should beat it with shoes
many times just after awakening and again before going to sleep. In this way one can control the mind.
This is the instruction of all the sastras. If one does not do so, one is doomed to follow the dictations of
the mind. Another bona fide process is to abide strictly by the orders of the spiritual master and engage in
the Lord's service. Then the mind will be automatically controlled. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
instructed Srila Rupa Gosvami:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
When one receives the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the guru and Krsna. the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one's real life begins. If one abides by the orders of the spiritual master, by the
grace of Krsna he is freed from service to the mind.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Eleventh Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Jada Bharata Instructs King Rahugana."
Chapter Twelve
Conversation Between Maharaja Rahugana and Jada Bharata
Because Maharaja Rahugana was still doubtful about his enlightenment, he asked the brahmana Jada
Bharata to repeat his instructions and clarify ideas he could not understand. In this chapter, Maharaja
Rahugana offers his respectful obeisances to Jada Bharata, who was concealing his real position. The King
could understand by his speech how exalted and advanced he was in spiritual knowledge. He very much
regretted his offense against him. Maharaja Rahugana was bitten by the serpent of ignorance, but was
cured by the nectarean words of Jada Bharata. Later, because he was doubtful about the subjects
discussed, he made further inquiries, one question after another. First he wanted to be released from the
offense he had committed at the lotus feet of Jada Bharata.
Maharaja Rahugana was somewhat unhappy at not being able to grasp Jada Bharata's instructions, which
were full of meaning that could not be understood by a materialistic person. Therefore Jada Bharata
repeated his instructions more clearly. He said that on the surface of the globe all living entities, moving
and unmoving, were but transformations of the earth in different ways. The King was very proud of his
king's body, but that body was simply another transformation of the earth. Out of his false prestige, the
King was misbehaving toward the palanquin carrier. as a master toward a servant, and he was actually
very unkind to other living entities. Consequently King Rahugana was unfit to give protection to the
citizens, and because he was ignorant, he was unfit to be counted among advanced philosophers.
Everything in the material world is but a transformation of the earth, although things have different
names according to their transformations. Actually the varieties are one and the same, and ultimately all
these varieties are vanquished into atoms. Nothing is permanent in this material world. The variety of
things and their distinctions are simply mental concoctions. The Absolute Truth is beyond illusion and is
manifest in three features--impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and the Supreme personality of
Godhead. Ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, called
Vasudeva by His devotees. Unless one is blessed with the dust from the feet of a pure devotee on his head,
one cannot possibly become a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Jada Bharata also told about his own previous birth and informed the King that by the grace of the Lord
he still remembered all the incidents of his past life. Due to the activities of his past life, Jada Bharata was
being very cautious and was therefore assuming the characteristics of a deaf and dumb man to avoid
mingling with the material world. Association with the material modes of nature is very powerful. The
bad association of materialistic men can be avoided only in the association of devotees. In the association
of devotees, one is given an opportunity to render devotional service in nine different ways--sravanam
kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. In this
way, in the association of devotees, one can pass over material association, cross over the ocean of
nescience and return home, back to Godhead.
