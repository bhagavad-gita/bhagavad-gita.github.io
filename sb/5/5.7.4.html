<h2>Synonyms</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Bharata was a very learned and experienced king on this earth. He perfectly ruled the citizens,
being himself engaged in his own respective duties. Maharaja Bharata was as affectionate to the citizens as
his father and grandfather had been. Keeping them engaged in their occupational duties, he ruled the
earth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is most important that the chief executive rule the citizens by keeping them fully engaged in their
respective occupational duties. Some of the citizens were brahmanas, some were ksatriyas, and some were
vaisyas and sudras. It is the duty of the government to see that the citizens act according to these material
divisions for their spiritual advancement. No one should remain unemployed or unoccupied in any way.
One must work as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra on the material path. and on the spiritual path,
everyone should act as a brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi. Although formerly the
government was a monarchy, all the kings were very affectionate toward the citizens. and they strictly
kept them engaged in their respective duties. Therefore society was very smoothly conducted.
