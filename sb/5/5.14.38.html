<h2>Translation</h2>
The path of this material world is full of material miseries, and various troubles disturb the conditioned
souls. Sometimes he loses, and sometimes he gains. In either case, the path is full of danger. Sometimes
the conditioned soul is separated from his father by death or other circumstances. Leaving him aside he
gradually becomes attached to others, such as his children. In this way, the conditioned soul is sometimes
illusioned and afraid. Sometimes he cries loudly out of fear. Sometimes he is happy maintaining his
family, and sometimes he is overjoyed and sings melodiously. In this way he becomes entangled and
forgets his separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead since time immemorial. Thus he traverses
the dangerous path of material existence, and on this path he is not at all happy. Those who are selfrealized
simply take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to get out of this dangerous
material existence. Without accepting the devotional path, one cannot get out of the clutches of material
existence. The conclusion is that no one can be happy in material life. One must take to Krsna
consciousness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By thoroughly analyzing the materialistic way of life, any sane man can understand that there is not the
least happiness in this world. However, due to continuing on the path of danger from time immemorial
and not associating with saintly persons, the conditioned soul, under illusion, wants to enjoy this material
world. Material energy sometimes gives him a chance at so-called happiness, but the conditioned soul is
perpetually being punished by material nature. It is therefore said: dandya-jane raja yena nadite cubaya
(Cc. Madhya 20.118). Materialistic life means continuous unhappiness, but sometimes we accept
happiness as it appears between the gaps. Sometimes a condemned person is submerged in water and
hauled out. Actually all of this is meant for punishment, but he feels a little comfort when he is taken out
of the water. This is the situation with the conditioned soul. All the sastras therefore advise that one
associate with devotees and saintly people.
'sadhu-sanga', 'sadhu-sanga'----sarva-sastre kaya
lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya
(Cc. Madhya 22.54)
Even by a little association with devotees, the conditioned soul can get out of this miserable material
condition. This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore trying to give everyone a chance to associate
with saintly people. Therefore all the members of this Krsna consciousness society must themselves be
perfect sadhus in order to give a chance to fallen conditioned souls. This is the best humanitarian work.
