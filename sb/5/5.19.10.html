<h2>Translation</h2>
In his own book, known as Narada Pancaratra, Bhagavan Narada has very vividly described how to work
to achieve the ultimate goal of life--devotion--through knowledge and through execution of the mystic
yoga system. He has also described the glories of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The great
sage Narada instructed the tenets of this transcendental literature to Savarni Manu in order to teach those
inhabitants of Bharata-varsa who strictly follow the principles of varnasrama-dharma how to achieve the
devotional service of the Lord. Thus Narada Muni, along with the other inhabitants of Bharata-varsa,
always engages in the service of Nara-Narayana, and he chants as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has clearly declared:
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
The real success or fulfillment of the mission of human life can be achieved in India, Bharata-varsa,
because in Bharata-varsa the purpose of life and the method for achieving success are evident. People
should take advantage of the opportunity afforded by Bharata-varsa, and this is especially so for those who
are following the principles of varnasrama-dharma. If we do not take to the principles of varnasramadharma
by accepting the four social orders (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and the four orders of
spiritual life (brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa), there can be no question of success in life.
Unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, everything is now being lost. The inhabitants of
Bharata-varsa are gradually becoming degraded mlecchas and yavanas. How then will they teach others?
Therefore, this Krsna consciousness movement has been started not only for the inhabitants of Bharatavarsa
but for all the people of the world, as announced by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. There is still time,
and if the inhabitants of Bharata-varsa take this movement of Krsna consciousness seriously, the entire
world will be saved from gliding down to a hellish condition. The Krsna consciousness movement follows
the process of pancaratrika-vidhi and that of bhagavata-vidhi simultaneously, so that people can take
advantage of the movement and make their lives successful.
