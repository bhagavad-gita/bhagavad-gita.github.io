<h2>Translation</h2>
In the performance of a sacrifice, there are seven transcendental means to obtain the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead: (1) by sacrificing valuable things or eatables, (2) by acting in terms of
place, (3) by acting in terms of time, (4) by offering hymns, (5) by going through the priest, (6) by
offering gifts to the priests and (7) by observing the regulative principles. However, one cannot always
obtain the Supreme Lord through this paraphernalia. Nonetheless, the Lord is affectionate to His devotee;
therefore when Maharaja Nabhi, who was a devotee, worshiped and offered prayers to the Lord with great
faith and devotion and with a pure uncontaminated mind, superficially performing some yajna in the line
of pravargya, the kind Supreme Personality of Godhead, due to His affection for His devotees, appeared
before King Nabhi in His unconquerable and captivating form with four hands. In this way, to fulfill the
desire of His devotee, the Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested Himself in His beautiful body
before His devotee. This body pleases the mind and eyes of the devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in
full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God." (Bg.
18.55)
One can understand and see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process of devotional
service, and not in any other way. Although Maharaja Nabhi performed prescribed duties and sacrifices, it
should still be considered that the Lord appeared before him not due to his sacrifices but because of his
devotional service. It was for this reason that the Lord agreed to appear before him in His beautiful bodily
features. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.30), the Supreme Lord in His original nature is very beautiful.
Venum kvanantam aravinda-dalayataksam barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam: the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, although blackish, is very, very beautiful.
