<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: In Hiranmaya-varsa, the Supreme Lord, Visnu, lives in the form of a
tortoise [kurma-sarira]. This most dear and beautiful form is always worshiped there in devotional service
by Aryama, the chief resident of Hiranmaya-varsa, along with the other inhabitants of that land. They
chant the following hymns.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word priyatama (dearmost) is very significant in this verse. Each devotee regards a particular form
of the Lord as most dear. Because of an atheistic mentality, some people think that the tortoise, boar and
fish incarnations of the Lord are not very beautiful. They do not know that any form of the Lord is always
the fully opulent Personality of Godhead. Since one of His opulences is infinite beauty, all the Lord's
incarnations are very beautiful and are appreciated as such by devotees. Nondevotees, however, think that
Lord Krsna's incarnations are ordinary material creatures, and therefore they distinguish between the
beautiful and the not beautiful. A certain form of the Lord is worshiped by a particular devotee because he
loves to see that form of the Lord. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.33): advaitam acyutam anadim anantarupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca. The very beautiful form of the Lord is always youthful.
Sincere servants of a particular form of the Lord always see that form as very beautiful, and thus they
engage in constant devotional service to Him.
