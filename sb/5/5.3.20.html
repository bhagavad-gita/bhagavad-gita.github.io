<h2>Translation</h2>
O Visnudatta, Pariksit Maharaja, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the great sages at
that sacrifice. Consequently the Lord decided to personally exhibit the method of executing religious
principles [as observed by brahmacaris, sannyasis, vanaprasthas and grhasthas engaged in rituals] and also
satisfy Maharaja Nabhi's desire. Consequently He appeared as the son of Merudevi in His original spiritual
form, which is above the modes of material nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Supreme Lord appears or descends as an incarnation within this material world, He does not
accept a body made of the three modes of material nature (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna).
Mayavadi philosophers say that the impersonal God appears in this material world by accepting a body in
the sattva-guna. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti states that the word sukla means "consisting of suddhasattva."
Lord Visnu descends in His suddha-sattva form. Suddha-sattva refers to the sattva-guna which is
never contaminated. In this material world, even the mode of goodness (sattva-guna) is contaminated by
tinges of rajo-guna and tamo-guna. When sattva-guna is never contaminated by rajo-guna and tamo-guna,
it is called suddha-sattva. Sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam (Bhag. 4.3.23). That is the platform of
vasudeva, whereby the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, can be experienced. In Bhagavad-gita
(4.7) Sri Krsna Himself says:
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself."
Unlike ordinary living entities, the Supreme Lord is not forced by the modes of material nature to
appear. He appears dharman darsayitu-kama--to show how to execute the functions of a human being.
The word dharma is meant for human beings and is never used in connection with beings inferior to
human beings, such as animals. Unfortunately, without being guided by the Supreme Lord, human beings
sometimes manufacture a process of dharma by concoction. Actually dharma cannot be made by man.
Dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam. (Bhag. 6.3.19) Dharma is given by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, just as the law is given by the state government. Man-made dharma has no meaning. Srimad-
Bhagavatam refers to man-made dharma as kaitava-dharma, cheating religion. The Supreme Lord sends an
avatara (incarnation) to teach human society the proper way to execute religious principles. Such
religious principles are bhakti-marga. As the Supreme Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita: sarva-dharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. The son of Maharaja Nabhi, Rsabhadeva, appeared on this earth to
preach the principles of religion. That will be explained in the Fifth Chapter of this Fifth Canto.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Rsabhadeva's Appearance in the Womb of Merudevi, the wife of King Nabhi."
Chapter Four
The Characteristics of Rsabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
In this chapter, Rsabhadeva, the son of Maharaja Nabhi, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of
those sons the world was very happy in all respects. When Rsabhadeva appeared as the son of Maharaja
Nabhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His
poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond
compare. The word rsabha refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the
son of Maharaja Nabhi, the King named his son Rsabha, or "the best." His influence was incomparable.
Although there was a scarcity of rain, Rsabhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in
charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, Rsabhadeva sumptuously covered Ajanabha with
ample rain. Upon receiving Rsabhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King
Nabhi began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring
from family life, lived at Badarikasrama completely engaged in the worship of Vasudeva, the Supreme
Lord. To follow social customs, Lord Rsabhadeva for a while became a student in the gurukula, and after
returning. He followed the orders of His guru and accepted a wife named Jayanti. who had been given to
Him by the King of heaven, Indra. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayanti. Of these hundred
sons, the eldest was known as Bharata. Since the reign of Maharaja Bharata, this planet has been called
Bharata-varsa. Rsabhadeva's other sons were headed by Kusavarta, Ilavarta, Brahmavarta, Malaya, Ketu,
Bhadrasena, Indrasprk, Vidarbha and Kikata. There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antariksa,
Prabuddha, Pippalayana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhajana. Instead of ruling the kingdom,
these nine became mendicant preachers of Krsna consciousness, following the religious precepts of the
Bhagavatam. Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-
Bhagavatam during the talks between Vasudeva and Narada at Kuruksetra. To teach the general populace,
King Rsabhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens.
