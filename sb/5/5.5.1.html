<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Rsabhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material
bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night
simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage
in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one's heart is
purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to
material happiness and which continues forever.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse Lord Rsabhadeva tells His sons about the importance of human life. The word deha-bhak
refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must
act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After
undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating,
drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time. they have to properly defend themselves. However,
this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of
spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to
their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities
and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life. one can enjoy happiness
eternally. After all. every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the
material body. he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We
should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.
It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate
subordinates and raise them to Krsna consciousness. Devoid of Krsna consciousness, every living being
suffers in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to
become blissful and happy. bhakti-yoga should be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people
how to rise to the platform of bhakti-yoga. Without Krsna consciousness a person is no better than a hog
or dog. The instructions of Rsabhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being
educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification. and there is no sublime aim in life. A man
travels to earn his livelihood. leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed
in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again
he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three
hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness
is a little sex. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. Rsabhadeva clearly states that human life is
not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs do
not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in a different way and should not try
to imitate dogs and hogs. The alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for tapasya, austerity and
penance. By tapasya, one can get out of the material clutches. When one is situated in Krsna
consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is guaranteed eternally. By taking to bhakti-yoga,
devotional service, one's existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after life, but he
can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing bhakti-yoga. Then he immediately becomes
eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
