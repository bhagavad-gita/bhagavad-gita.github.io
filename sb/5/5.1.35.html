<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, a devotee who has taken shelter of the dust from the lotus feet of the Lord can transcend
the influence of the six material whips--namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death--
and he can conquer the mind and five senses. However, this is not very wonderful for a pure devotee of
the Lord because even a person beyond the jurisdiction of the four castes--in other words, an
untouchable--is immediately relieved of bondage to material existence if he utters the holy name of the
Lord even once.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami was speaking to Maharaja Pariksit about the activities of King Priyavrata, and since
the King might have had doubts about these wonderful, uncommon activities, Sukadeva Gosvami
reassured him. "My dear King," he said, "don't be doubtful about the wonderful activities of Priyavrata.
For a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is possible because the Lord is also
known as Urukrama." Urukrama is a name for Lord Vamanadeva, who performed the wonderful act of
occupying the three worlds with three footsteps. Lord Vamanadeva requested three paces of land from
Maharaja Bali, and when Maharaja Bali agreed to grant them, the Lord immediately covered the entire
world with two footsteps, and for His third step He placed His foot upon Bali Maharaja's head. Sri
Jayadeva Gosvami says:
chalayasi vikramane balim adbhuta-vamana
pada-nakha-nira-janita-jana-pavana
kesava dhrta-vamana-rupa jaya jagadisa hare
"All glories to Lord Kesava, who assumed the form of a dwarf. O Lord of the universe, who takes away
everything inauspicious for the devotees! O wonderful Vamanadeva! You tricked the great demon Bali
Maharaja by Your steps. The water that touched the nails of Your lotus feet when You pierced through the
covering of the universe purifies all living entities in the form of the River Ganges."
Since the Supreme Lord is all-powerful, He can do things that seem wonderful for a common man.
Similarly, a devotee who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord can also do wonderful things.
unimaginable to a common man, by the grace of the dust of those lotus feet. Caitanya Mahaprabhu
therefore teaches us to take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"O son of Nanda Maharaja, I am Your eternal servant, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean
of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms of Your
lotus feet." Lord Caitanya teaches us to come in touch with the dust of the Lord's lotus feet, for then there
will undoubtedly be all success.
Because of the material body, every living entity in material existence is always disturbed by sad-guna,
six whips--hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, invalidity and death. Furthermore, another sad-guna are
the mind and five sense organs. Not to speak of a sanctified devotee, even a candala, an outcaste, who is
untouchable, is immediately freed from material bondage if he utters the holy name of the Lord even
once. Sometimes caste brahmanas argue that unless one changes his body he cannot be accepted as a
brahmana, for since the present body is obtained as a result of past actions, one who has in the past acted
as a brahmana takes birth in a brahmana family. Therefore, they contend, without such a brahminical
body, one cannot be accepted as a brahmana. Herein it is said, however, that even vidura-vigata, a
candala--a fifth-class untouchable--is freed if he utters the holy name even once. Being freed means that
he immediately changes his body. Sanatana Gosvami confirms this:
yatha kancanatam yati
kamsyam rasa-vidhanatah
tatha diksa-vidhanena
dvijatvam jayate nrnam
When a person, even though a candala, is initiated by a pure devotee into chanting the holy name of the
Lord, his body changes as he follows the instructions of the spiritual master. Although one cannot see
how his body has changed, we must accept, on the grounds of the authoritative statements of the sastras,
that he changes his body. This is to be understood without arguments. This verse clearly says. sa jahati
bandham: "He gives up his material bondage." The body is a symbolic representation of material bondage
according to one's karma. Although sometimes we cannot see the gross body changing, chanting the holy
name of the Supreme Lord immediately changes the subtle body, and because the subtle body changes,
the living entity is immediately freed from material bondage. After all, changes of the gross body are
conducted by the subtle body. After the destruction of the gross body, the subtle body takes the living
entity from his present gross body to another. In the subtle body, the mind is predominant, and therefore
if one's mind is always absorbed in remembering the activities or the lotus feet of the Lord, he is to be
understood to have already changed his present body and become purified. Therefore it is irrefutable that
a candala, or any fallen or lowborn person, can become a brahmana simply by the method of bona fide
initiation.
