<h2>Translation</h2>
We are now living in the heavenly planets, undoubtedly as a result of our having performed ritualistic
ceremonies, pious activities and yajnas and having studied the Vedas. However, our lives here will one
day be finished. We pray that at that time, if any merit remains from our pious activities, we may again
take birth in Bharata-varsa as human beings able to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so
kind that He personally comes to the land of Bharata-varsa and expands the good fortune of its people.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is certainly as a result of pious activities that one takes birth in the heavenly planets, but from those
planets one must nevertheless come down again to earth, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (ksine punye martyalokam
visanti). Even the demigods must return to earth to work like ordinary men when the results of
their pious activities expire. Nevertheless, the demigods desire to come to the land of Bharata-varsa if even
a small portion of the merits of their pious activities remains. In other words, to take birth in Bharatavarsa,
one must perform more pious activities than the demigods. In Bharata-varsa one is naturally Krsna
conscious, and if one further cultivates his Krsna consciousness, by the grace of Krsna he certainly
expands his good fortune by becoming perfect in Krsna consciousness and very easily going back home,
back to Godhead. In many other places in the Vedic literature it is found that even the demigods want to
come to this land of Bharata-varsa. A foolish person may desire to be promoted to the heavenly planets as
a result of his pious activities, but even the demigods from the heavenly planets want to come to Bharatavarsa
and achieve bodies that may be very easily used to cultivate Krsna consciousness. Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu repeatedly says:
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
A human being born in the land of Bharata-varsa has the special prerogative to develop Krsna
consciousness. Therefore those already born in Bharata-varsa should take lessons from the sastras and
guru and should fully take advantage of the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in order to be fully
equipped with Krsna consciousness. By taking full advantage of Krsna consciousness, one goes back
home, back to Godhead (yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam). The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore
spreading this facility to human society by opening many, many centers all over the world so that people
may associate with the pure devotees of the Krsna consciousness movement, understand the science of
Krsna consciousness and ultimately go back home, back to Godhead.
