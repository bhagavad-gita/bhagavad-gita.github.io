<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It was ordained that Ravana, chief of the Raksasas, could not be killed by anyone but a man, and for this
reason Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in the form of a human being.
Lord Ramacandra's mission, however, was not only to kill Ravana but also to teach mortal beings that
material happiness centered around sex life or centered around one's wife is the cause of many miseries.
He is the self-sufficient Supreme Personality of Godhead, and nothing is lamentable for Him. Therefore
why else could He be subjected to tribulations by the kidnapping of mother Sita?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord appears in this universe in the form of a human being, He has two purposes, as stated in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9)--paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: to destroy the demons and protect the
devotees. To protect the devotees, the Lord not only satisfies them by His personal presence but also
teaches them so that they will not fall down from devotional service. By His personal example, Lord
Ramacandra taught the devotees that it is better not to enter married life, which is certainly followed by
many tribulations. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.9.45):
yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham
kanduyanena karayor iva duhkha-duhkham
trpyanti neha krpana bahu-duhkha-bhajah
kandutivan manasijam visaheta-dhirah
Krpanas, those who are not advanced in spiritual knowledge and who are therefore just the opposite of
brahmanas, generally take to family life, which is a concession for sex. Thus they enjoy sex again and
again, although that sex is followed by many tribulations. This is a warning to devotees. To teach this
lesson to devotees and to human society in general, Lord Sri Ramacandra, although the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself, underwent a series of tribulations because He accepted a wife, mother
Sita. Lord Ramacandra underwent these austerities, of course, only to instruct us; actually He never has
any reason to lament for anything.
Another aspect of the Lord's instructions is that one who accepts a wife must be a faithful husband and
give her full protection. Human society is divided into two classes of men--those who strictly follow the
religious principles and those who are devotees. By His personal example, Lord Ramacandra wanted to
instruct both of them how to fully adopt the discipline of the religious system and how to be a beloved
and dutiful husband. Otherwise He had no reason to undergo apparent tribulations. One who strictly
follows religious principles must not neglect to provide all facilities for the complete protection of his
wife. There may be some suffering because of this, but one must nevertheless endure it. That is the duty
of a faithful husband. By His personal example, Lord Ramacandra demonstrated this duty. Lord
Ramacandra could have produced hundreds and thousands of Sitas from His pleasure energy, but just to
show the duty of a faithful husband, He not only rescued Sita from the hands of Ravana but also killed
Ravana and all the members of his family.
Another aspect of the teachings of Lord Ramacandra is that although Lord Visnu, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and His devotees may apparently suffer from material tribulations, they have
nothing to do with such tribulations. They are mukta-purusas, liberated persons, under all circumstances.
It is therefore said in the Caitanya-bhagavata:
yata dekha vaisnavera vyavahara duhkha
niscaya janiha taha paramananda-sukha
A Vaisnava is always firmly situated in transcendental bliss because of engagement in devotional service.
Although he may appear to suffer material pains, his position is called transcendental bliss in separation
(viraha). The emotions a lover and beloved feel when separated from one another are actually very
blissful, although apparently painful. Therefore the separation of Lord Ramacandra from Sitadevi, as well
as the consequent tribulation they suffered, is but another display of transcendental bliss. That is the
opinion of Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura.
