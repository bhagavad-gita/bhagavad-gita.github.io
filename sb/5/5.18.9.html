TRANSLATION
May there be good fortune throughout the universe, and may all envious persons be pacified. May all
living entities become calm by practicing bhakti-yoga, for by accepting devotional service they will think
of each other's welfare. Therefore let us all engage in the service of the supreme transcendence, Lord Sri
Krsna, and always remain absorbed in thought of Him.
PURPORT
The following verse describes a Vaisnava:
vancha-kalpa-tarubhyas ca
krpa-sindhubhya eva ca
patitanam pavanebhyo
vaisnavebhyo namo namah
Just like a desire tree, a Vaisnava can fulfill all the desires of anyone who takes shelter of his lotus feet.
Prahlada Maharaja is a typical Vaisnava. He prays not for himself, but for all living entities--the gentle, the
envious and the mischievous. He always thought of the welfare of mischievous persons like his father,
Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada Maharaja did not ask for anything for himself; rather, he prayed for the Lord to
excuse his demoniac father. This is the attitude of a Vaisnava, who always thinks of the welfare of the
entire universe.
Srimad-Bhagavatam and bhagavata-dharma are meant for persons who are completely free of envy
(parama-nirmatsaranam). Therefore Prahlada Maharaja prays in this verse, khalah prasidatam: "May all
the envious persons be pacified." The material world is full of envious persons, but if one frees himself of
envy, he becomes liberal in his social dealings and can think of others' welfare. Anyone who takes up
Krsna consciousness and engages himself completely in the service of the Lord cleanses his mind of all
envy (manas ca bhadram bhajatad adhoksaje). Therefore we should pray to Lord Nrsimhadeva to sit in
our hearts. We should pray, bahir nrsimho hrdaye nrsimhah: "Let Lord Nrsimhadeva sit in the core of my
heart, killing all my bad propensities. Let my mind become clean so that I may peacefully worship the
Lord and bring peace to the entire world."
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has given us a very fine purport in this regard. Whenever one offers
a prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one always requests some benediction from Him. Even
pure (niskama) devotees pray for some benediction, as instructed by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in
His Siksastaka:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"O son of Maharaja Nanda [Krsna], I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into
the ocean of birth and death. Please pick Me up from the ocean of death and place Me as one of the atoms
at Your lotus feet." In another prayer Lord Caitanya says, mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir
ahaituki tvayi: "Life after life, kindly let Me have unalloyed love and devotion at Your Lordship's lotus
feet." When Prahlada Maharaja chants om namo bhagavate narasimhaya, he prays for a benediction from
the Lord, but because he is also an exalted Vaisnava, he wants nothing for his personal sense gratification.
The first desire expressed in his prayer is svasty astu visvasya: "Let there be good fortune throughout the
entire universe." Prahlada Maharaja thus requested the Lord to be merciful to everyone, including his
father, a most envious person. According to Canakya Pandita, there are two kinds of envious living
entities: one is a snake, and the other is the man like Hiranyakasipu, who is by nature envious of
everyone, even of his father or son. Hiranyakasipu was envious of his little son Prahlada, but Prahlada
Maharaja asked a benediction for the benefit of his father. Hiranyakasipu was very envious of devotees,
but Prahlada wished that his father and other demons like him would give up their envious nature by the
grace of the Lord and stop harassing the devotees (khalah prasidatam). The difficulty is that the khala
(envious living entity) is rarely pacified. One kind of khala, the snake, can be pacified simply by mantras
or by the action of a particular herb (mantrausadhi-vasah sarpah khalakena nivaryate). An envious
person, however, cannot be pacified by any means. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja prays that all envious
persons may undergo a change of heart and think of the welfare of others.
If the Krsna consciousness movement spreads all over the world, and if by the grace of Krsna everyone
accepts it, the thinking of envious people will change. Everyone will think of the welfare of others.
Therefore Prahlada Maharaja prays, sivam mitho dhiya. In material activities, everyone is envious of
others, but in Krsna consciousness, no one is envious of anyone else; everyone thinks of the welfare of
others. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja prays that everyone's mind may become gentle by being fixed at the
lotus feet of Krsna (bhajatad adhoksaje). As indicated elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (sa vai manah
krsna-padaravindayoh) and as advised by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (18.65), man-mana bhava madbhaktah,
one should constantly think of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. Then one's mind will certainly be
cleansed (ceto-darpana-marjanam). Materialists always think of sense gratification, but Prahlada Maharaja
prays that the Lord's mercy will change their minds and they will stop thinking of sense gratification. If
they think of Krsna always, everything will be all right. Some people argue that if everyone thought of
Krsna in that way, the whole universe would be vacated because everyone would go back home, back to
Godhead. However, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that this is impossible because the living
entities are innumerable. If one set of living entities is actually delivered by the Krsna consciousness
movement, another set will fill the entire universe.
