<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, the merchant on the forest path of the material world, his intelligence victimized by
home, wealth, relatives and so forth, runs from one place to another in search of success. Sometimes his
eyes are covered by the dust of a whirlwind--that is to say, in his lust he is captivated by the beauty of his
wife, especially during her menstrual period. Thus his eyes are blinded, and he cannot see where to go or
what he is doing.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that household attraction resides in the wife because sex is the center of household life: yan
maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. A materialistic person, making his wife the center of
attraction, works very hard day and night. His only enjoyment in material life is sexual intercourse.
Therefore karmis are attracted to women as friends or wives. Indeed, they cannot work without sex.
Under the circumstances the wife is compared to a whirlwind. especially during her menstrual period.
Those who strictly follow the rules and regulations of householder life engage in sex only once a month,
at the end of the menstrual period. As one looks forward to this opportunity, his eyes are overwhelmed by
the beauty of his wife. Thus it is said that the whirlwind covers the eyes with dust. Such a lusty person
does not know that all his material activities are being observed by different demigods. especially the sungod,
and are being recorded for the karma of one's next body. Astrological calculations are called jyotisastra.
Because the jyoti, or effulgence, in the material world comes from the different stars and planets,
the science is called jyoti-sastra, the science of the luminaries. By the calculations of jyoti, our future is
indicated. In other words, all the luminaries--the stars, sun and moon--witness the activities of the
conditioned soul. Thus he is awarded a particular type of body. A lusty, person whose eyes are covered by
the dust of the whirlwind or material existence does not at all consider that his activities are being
observed by different stars and planets and are being recorded. Not knowing this, the conditioned soul
commits all kinds of sinful activities for the satisfaction of his lusty desires.
