<h2>Text</h2>
sa vai patih syad akutobhayah svayam
samantatah pati bhayaturam janam
sa eka evetaratha mitho bhayam
naivatmalabhad adhi manyate param
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; vai--indeed; patih--a husband; syat--would be; akutah-bhayah--who is not fearful of anyone;
svayam--self-sufficient; samantatah--entirely; pati--maintains; bhaya-aturam--who is very afraid; janam--a
person; sah--therefore he; ekah--one; eva--only; itaratha--otherwise; mithah--from one another; bhayam--
fear; na--not; eva--indeed; atma-labhat--than the attainment of You; adhi--greater; manyate--is accepted;
param--other thing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He alone who is never afraid but who, on the contrary, gives complete shelter to all fearful persons can
actually become a husband and protector. Therefore, my Lord, you are the only husband, and no one else
can claim this position. If you were not the only husband, You would be afraid of others. Therefore
persons learned in all Vedic literature accept only Your Lordship as everyone's master, and they think no
one else a better husband and protector than You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the meaning of husband or guardian is clearly explained. people want to become a husband, a
guardian, a governor or a political leader without knowing the actual meaning of such a superior position.
There are many people all over the world--indeed, throughout the universe--who claim for some time that
they are husbands, political leaders or guardians, but in due course of time the Supreme Lord desires their
removal from their posts, and their careers are immediately finished. Therefore those who are actually
learned and advanced in spiritual life do not accept any leader, husband or maintainer other than the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Lord Krsna personally states in Bhagavad-gita (18.66), aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami: "I
shall deliver you from all sinful reactions." Krsna is not afraid of anyone. On the contrary, everyone is
afraid of Krsna. Therefore He can actually give protection to a subordinate living entity. Since so-called
leaders or dictators are completely under the control of material nature, they can never give complete
protection to others, although they claim this ability due to false prestige. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi
visnum: people do not know that real advancement in life consists of accepting the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as one's master. Instead of deceiving themselves and others by pretending to be all-powerful,
all political leaders, husbands and guardians should spread the Krsna consciousness movement so that
everyone can learn how to surrender to Krsna, the supreme husband.
