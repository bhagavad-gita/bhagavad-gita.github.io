sa loka-trayante parita isvarena vihito yasmat suryadinam dhruvapavarganam jyotir-gananam gabhastayo
'rvacinams tril lokan avitanvana na kadacit paracina bhavitum utsahante tavad un-nahanayamah.
SYNONYMS
sah--that mountain; loka-traya-ante--at the end of the three lokas (Bhurloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka);
paritah--all around; isvarena--by the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna; vihitah--created; yasmat--
from which; surya-adinam--of the sun planet; dhruva-apavarganam--up to Dhruvaloka and other, inferior
luminaries; jyotih-gananam--of all the luminaries; gabhastayah--the rays; arvacinan--on this side; trin--the
three; lokan--planetary systems; avitanvanah--spreading throughout; na--not; kadacit--at any time;
paracinah--beyond the jurisdiction of that mountain; bhavitum--to be; utsahante--are able; tavat--that
much; unnahana-ayamah--the measure of the height of the mountain.
TRANSLATION
By the supreme will of Krsna, the mountain known as Lokaloka has been installed as the outer border of
the three worlds--Bhurloka, Bhuvarloka and Svarloka--to control the rays of the sun throughout the
universe. All the luminaries, from the sun up to Dhruvaloka, distribute their rays throughout the three
worlds, but only within the boundary formed by this mountain. Because it is extremely high, extending
even higher than Dhruvaloka, it blocks the rays of the luminaries, which therefore can never extend
beyond it.
PURPORT
When we speak of loka-traya, we refer to the three primary planetary systems--Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah--
into which the universe is divided. Surrounding these planetary systems are the eight directions, namely
east, west, north, south, northeast, southeast, northwest and southwest. Lokaloka Mountain has been
established as the outer boundary of all the lokas to distribute the rays of the sun and other luminaries
equally throughout the universe.
This vivid description of how the rays of the sun are distributed throughout the different planetary
systems of the universe is very scientific. Sukadeva Gosvami described these universal affairs to Maharaja
Pariksit as he had heard about them from his predecessor. He explained these facts five thousand years
ago, but the knowledge existed long, long before because Sukadeva Gosvami received it through disciplic
succession. Because this knowledge is accepted through the disciplic succession, it is perfect. The history
of modern scientific knowledge, on the contrary, does not go back more than a few hundred years.
Therefore, even if modern scientists do not accept the other factual presentations of Srimad-Bhagavatam,
how can they deny the perfect astronomical calculations that existed long before they could imagine such
things? There is so much information to gather from Srimad-Bhagavatam. Modern scientists, however,
have no information of other planetary systems and, indeed, are hardly conversant with the planet on
which we are now living.
