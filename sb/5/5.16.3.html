<h2>Translation</h2>
The seven great sages [Marici, Vasistha, Atri and so on] reside on planets beneath Dhruvaloka. Well
aware of the influence of the water of the Ganges, to this day they keep Ganges water on the tufts of hair
on their heads. They have concluded that this is the ultimate wealth, the perfection of all austerities, and
the best means of prosecuting transcendental life. Having obtained uninterrupted devotional service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, they neglect all other beneficial processes like religion, economic
development, sense gratification and even merging into the Supreme. Just as jnanis think that merging
into the existence of the Lord is the highest truth, these seven exalted personalities accept devotional
service as the perfection of life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Transcendentalists are divided into two primary groups: the nirvisesa-vadis, or impersonalists, and the
bhaktas, or devotees. The impersonalists do not accept spiritual varieties of life. They want to merge into
the existence of the Supreme Lord in His Brahman feature (the brahmajyoti). The devotees, however,
desire to take part in the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord. In the upper planetary system, the
topmost planet is Dhruvaloka, and beneath Dhruvaloka are the seven planets occupied by the great sages,
beginning with Marici, Vasistha and Atri. All these sages regard devotional service as the highest
perfection of life. Therefore they all carry the holy water of the Ganges on their heads. This verse proves
that for one who has achieved the platform of pure devotional service, nothing else is important, even socalled
liberation (kaivalya). Srila Sridhara Svami states that only by achieving pure devotional service of
the Lord can one give up all other engagements as insignificant. Prabodhananda Sarasvati confirms his
statement as follows:
kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has perfectly enunciated and broadcast the process of bhakti-yoga.
Consequently, for one who has taken shelter at the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the highest
perfection of the Mayavadis, kaivalya, or becoming one with the Supreme, is considered hellish, to say
nothing of the karmis' aspiration to be promoted to the heavenly planets. Devotees consider such goals to
be worthless phantasmagoria. There are also yogis, who try to control their senses, but they can never
succeed without coming to the stage of devotional service. The senses are compared to poisonous snakes,
but the senses of a bhakta engaged in the service of the Lord are like snakes with their poisonous fangs
removed. The yogi tries to suppress his senses, but even great mystics like Visvamitra fail in the attempt.
Visvamitra was conquered by his senses when he was captivated by Menaka during his meditation. She
later gave birth to Sakuntala. The wisest persons in the world, therefore, are the bhakti-yogis, as Lord
Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."
