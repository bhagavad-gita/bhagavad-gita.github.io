<h2>Translation</h2>
Indra, the King of heaven, who is very materially opulent, became envious of King Rsabhadeva.
Consequently he stopped pouring water on the planet known as Bharata-varsa. At that time the Supreme
Lord, Rsabhadeva, the master of all mystic power, understood King Indra's purpose and smiled a little.
Then, by His own prowess, through yogamaya [His internal potency], He profusely poured water upon
His own place, which was known as Ajanabha.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We find the word bhagavan used twice in this verse. Both King Indra and Rsabhadeva, the incarnation
of the Supreme Lord, are described as bhagavan. Sometimes Narada and Lord Brahma are also addressed
as bhagavan. The word bhagavan means that one is a very opulent and powerful person like Lord Brahma,
Lord Siva, Narada or Indra. They are all addressed as bhagavan due to their extraordinary opulence. King
Rsabhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and therefore He was the original Bhagavan.
Consequently He is described herein as yogesvara, which indicates that He has the most powerful spiritual
potency. He is not dependent on King Indra for water. He can supply water Himself, and He did so in this
case. In Bhagavad-gita, it is stated: yajnad bhavati parjanyah. Due to the performance of yajna, clouds of
water are manifest in the sky. Clouds and rainfall are under the management of Indra, the heavenly King,
but when Indra is neglectful, the Supreme Lord Himself, who is also known as yajna or yajna-pati, takes
the task upon Himself. Consequently there was sufficient rainfall in the place named Ajanabha. When
yajna-pati wants to, He can do anything without the help of any subordinate. Therefore the Supreme Lord
is known as almighty. In the present age of Kali there will eventually be a great scarcity of water
(anavrsti), for the general populace. due to ignorance and the scarcity of yajnic ingredients. will neglect to
perform yajnas. Srimad-Bhagavatam therefore advises: yajnaih sankirtana-prayaih yajanti hi sumedhasah.
After all, yajna is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age of Kali. there is great
scarcity and ignorance; nonetheless, everyone can perform sankirtana-yajna. Every family in every society
can conduct sankirtana-yajna at least every evening. In this way there will be no disturbance or scarcity of
rain. It is essential for the people in this age to perform the sankirtana-yajna in order to be materially
happy and to advance spiritually.
