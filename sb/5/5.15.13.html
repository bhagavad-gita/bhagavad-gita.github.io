yat-prinanad barhisi deva-tiryanmanusya-
virut-trnam avirincat
priyeta sadyah sa ha visva-jivah
pritah svayam pritim agad gayasya
SYNONYMS
yat-prinanat--because of pleasing the Supreme personality of Godhead; barhisi--in the sacrificial arena;
deva-tiryak--the demigods and lower animals; manusya--human society; virut--the plants and trees;
trnam--the grass; a-virincat--beginning from Lord Brahma; priyeta--becomes satisfied; sadyah--
immediately; sah--that Supreme personality of Godhead; ha--indeed; visva-jivah--maintains the living
entities all over the universe; pritah--although naturally satisfied; svayam--personally; pritim--satisfaction;
agat--he obtained; gayasya--of Maharaja Gaya.
TRANSLATION
When the Supreme Lord is pleased by a person's actions, automatically all the demigods, human beings,
animals, birds, bees, creepers, trees, grass and all other living entities, beginning with Lord Brahma, are
pleased. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supersoul of everyone, and He is by nature fully
pleased. Nonetheless, He came to the arena of Maharaja Gaya and said, "I am fully pleased."
PURPORT
It is explicitly stated herein that simply by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one satisfies
the demigods and all other living entities without differentiation. If one pours water on the root of a tree,
all the branches, twigs, flowers and leaves are nourished. Although the Supreme Lord is self-satisfied, He
was so pleased with the behavior of Maharaja Gaya that He personally came to the sacrificial arena and
said, "I am fully satisfied." Who can compare to Maharaja Gaya?
