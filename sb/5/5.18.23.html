TRANSLATION
O infallible one, Your lotus palm is the source of all benediction. Therefore Your pure devotees worship
it, and You very mercifully place Your hand on their heads. I wish that You may also place Your hand on
My head, for although You already bear my insignia of golden streaks on Your chest, I regard this honor
as merely a kind of false prestige for me. You show Your real mercy to Your devotees, not to me. Of
course, You are the supreme absolute controller, and no one can understand Your motives.
PURPORT
In many places, the sastras describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being more inclined toward
His devotees than toward His wife, who always remains on His chest. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.15) it
is stated:
na tatha me priyatama
atma-yonir na sankarah
na ca sankarsano na srir
naivatma ca yatha bhavan
Here Krsna plainly says that His devotees are more dear to Him than Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Lord
Sankarsana (the original cause of creation), the goddess of fortune or even His own Self. Elsewhere in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.9.20) Sukadeva Gosvami says,
nemam virinco na bhavo
na srir apy anga samsraya
prasadam lebhire gopi
yat tat prapa vimuktidat
The Supreme Lord, who can award liberation to anyone, showed more mercy toward the gopis than to
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva or even the goddess of fortune, who is His own wife and is associated with His
body. Similarly, Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.47.60) also states:
nayam sriyo 'nga u nitanta-rateh prasadah
svar-yositam nalina-gandha-rucam kuto 'nyah
rasotsave 'sya bhuja-danda-grhita-kanthalabdhasisam
ya udagad vraja-sundarinam
"The gopis received benedictions from the Lord that neither Laksmidevi nor the most beautiful dancers
in the heavenly planets could attain. In the rasa dance, the Lord showed His favor to the most fortunate
gopis by placing His arms on their shoulders and dancing with each of them individually. No one can
compare with the gopis, who received the causeless mercy of the Lord."
In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that no one can receive the real favor of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead without following in the footsteps of the gopis. Even the goddess of fortune could not receive
the same favor as the gopis, although she underwent severe austerities and penances for many years. Lord
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu discusses this point with Vyenkata Bhatta in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya
9.111-131): "The Lord inquired from Vyenkata Bhatta, 'Your worshipable goddess of fortune, Laksmi,
always remains on the chest of Narayana, and she is certainly the most chaste woman in the creation.
However, My Lord is Lord Sri Krsna, a cowherd boy engaged in tending cows. Why is it that Laksmi,
being such a chaste wife, wants to associate with My Lord? Just to associate with Krsna, Laksmi
abandoned all transcendental happiness in Vaikuntha and for a long time accepted vows and regulative
principles and performed unlimited austerities.'
"Vyenkata Bhatta replied, 'Lord Krsna and Lord Narayana are one and the same, but the pastimes of
Krsna are more relishable due to their sportive nature. They are very pleasing for Krsna's saktis. Since
Krsna and Narayana are both the same personality, Laksmi's association with Krsna did not break her vow
of chastity. Rather, it was in great fun that the goddess of fortune wanted to associate with Lord Krsna.
The goddess of fortune considered that her vow of chastity would not be damaged by her relationship
with Krsna. Rather, by associating with Krsna she could enjoy the benefit of the rasa dance. If she wanted
to enjoy herself with Krsna what fault is there? Why are you joking so about this?'
"Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu replied, 'I know that there is no fault in the goddess of fortune, but still she
could not enter into the rasa dance. We hear this from revealed scriptures. The authorities of Vedic
knowledge met Lord Ramacandra in Dandakaranya, and by their penances and austerities, they were
allowed to enter into the rasa dance. But can you tell me why the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, could not
get that opportunity? '
"To this Vyenkata Bhatta replied, 'I cannot enter into the mystery of this incident. I am an ordinary
living being. My intelligence is limited, and I am always disturbed. How can I understand the pastimes of
the Supreme Lord? They are deeper than millions of oceans.'
"Lord Caitanya replied, 'Lord Krsna has a specific characteristic. He attracts everyone's heart by the
mellow of His personal conjugal love. By following in the footsteps of the inhabitants of the planet known
as Vrajaloka or Goloka Vrndavana, one can attain the shelter of the lotus feet of Sri Krsna. However, the
inhabitants of that planet do not know that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unaware
that Krsna is the Supreme Lord, the residents of Vrndavana like Nanda Maharaja, Yasodadevi and the
gopis treat Krsna as their beloved son or lover. Mother Yasoda accepts Him as her son and sometimes
binds Him to a grinding mortar. Krsna's cowherd boy friends think He is an ordinary boy and get up on
His shoulders. In Goloka Vrndavana no one has any desire other than to love Krsna.' "
The conclusion is that one cannot associate with Krsna unless he has fully received the favor of the
inhabitants of Vrajabhumi. Therefore if one wants to be delivered by Krsna directly, he must take to the
service of the residents of Vrndavana, who are unalloyed devotees of the Lord.
