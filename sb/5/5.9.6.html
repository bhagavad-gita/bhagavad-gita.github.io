<h2>Translation</h2>
King Rahugana told Jada Bharata: How troublesome this is, my dear brother. You certainly appear very
fatigued because you have carried this palanquin alone without assistance for a long time and for a long
distance. Besides that, due to your old age you have become greatly troubled. My dear friend, I see that
you are not very firm, nor very strong and stout. Aren't your fellow carriers cooperating with you?
In this way the King criticized Jada Bharata with sarcastic words, yet despite being criticized in this way,
Jada Bharata had no bodily conception of the situation. He knew that he was not the body, for he had
attained his spiritual identity. He was neither fat, lean nor thin, nor had he anything to do with a lump of
matter, a combination of the five gross and three subtle elements. He had nothing to do with the material
body and its two hands and legs. In other words, he had completely realized his spiritual identity [aham
brahmasmi]. He was therefore unaffected by this sarcastic criticism from the King. Without saying
anything, he continued carrying the palanquin as before.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Jada Bharata was completely liberated. He did not even care when the dacoits attempted to kill his body;
he knew that he certainly was not the body. Even if the body were killed, he would not have cared, for he
was thoroughly convinced of the proposition found in Bhagavad-gita (2.20): na hanyate hanyamane
sarire. He knew that he could not be killed even if his body were killed. Although he did not protest, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His agent could not tolerate the injustice of the dacoits; therefore he
was saved by the mercy of Krsna, and the dacoits were killed. In this case, while carrying the palanquin,
he also knew that he was not the body. This body was very strong and stout, in sound condition and quite
competent to carry the palanquin. Due to his being freed from the bodily conception, the sarcastic words
of the King did not at all affect him. The body is created according to one's karma, and material nature
supplies the ingredients for the development of a certain type of body. The soul the body covers is
different from the bodily construction; therefore anything favorable or mischievous done to the body does
not affect the spirit soul. The Vedic injunction is asango hy ayam purusah: the spirit soul is always
unaffected by material arrangements.
