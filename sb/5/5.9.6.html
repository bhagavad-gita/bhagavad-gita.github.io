TRANSLATION
The brahmana father of Jada Bharata considered his son his heart and soul, and therefore he was very
much attached to him. He thought it wise to educate his son properly, and being absorbed in this
unsuccessful endeavor, he tried to teach his son the rules and regulations of brahmacarya--including the
execution of the Vedic vows, cleanliness, study of the Vedas, the regulative methods, service to the
spiritual master and the method of offering a fire sacrifice. He tried his best to teach his son in this way,
but all his endeavors failed. In his heart he hoped that his son would be a learned scholar, but all his
attempts were unsuccessful. Like everyone, this brahmana was attached to his home, and he had forgotten
that someday he would die. Death, however, was not forgetful. At the proper time, death appeared and
took him away.
PURPORT
Those too attached to family life, who forget that death comes in the future to take them away, become
attached and unable to finish their duty as human beings. The duty of human life is to solve all the
problems of life, but instead people remain attached to family affairs and duties. Although they forget
death, death will not forget them. Suddenly they will be kicked off the platform of a peaceful family life.
One may forget that he has to die, but death never forgets. Death comes always at the right time. The
brahmana father of Jada Bharata wanted to teach his son the process of brahmacarya, but he was
unsuccessful due to his son's unwillingness to undergo the process of Vedic advancement. Jada Bharata
was simply concerned with returning home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service through
sravanam kirtanam visnoh. He did not care for the Vedic instructions of his father. When one is fully
interested in the service of the Lord, he does not need to follow all the regulative principles enunciated in
the Vedas. Of course, for an ordinary man, the Vedic principles are imperative. No one can avoid them.
But when one has attained the perfection of devotional service, it is not very important to follow the Vedic
principles. Lord Krsna advised Arjuna to ascend to the platform of nistraigunya, the transcendental
position above the Vedic principles.
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the Self." (Bg. 2.45)
