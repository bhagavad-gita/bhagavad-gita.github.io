<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Pariksit, O best of the descendants of Bharata Maharaja, I have thus described to you, as I
myself have been instructed, the island of Bharata-varsa and its adjoining islands. These are the islands
that constitute Jambudvipa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "A Description of the Island of Jambudvipa."
Chapter Twenty
Studying the Structure of the Universe
In this chapter there is a description of various islands, beginning with Plaksadvipa, and the oceans that
surround them. There is also a description of the location and dimensions of the mountain known as
Lokaloka. The island of Plaksadvipa, which is twice as broad as Jambudvipa, is surrounded by an ocean of
salt water. The master of this island is Idhmajihva, one of the sons of Maharaja Priyavrata. The island is
divided into seven regions, each with a mountain and a large river.
The second island is called Salmalidvipa. It is surrounded by an ocean of liquor and is 3,200,000 miles
wide, twice as wide as Plaksadvipa. The master of this island is Yajnabahu, one of the sons of Maharaja
Priyavrata. Like Plaksadvipa, this island is also divided into seven regions, each with a mountain and a
very large river. The inhabitants of this island worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of
Candratma.
The third island, which is surrounded by an ocean of clarified butter and is also divided into seven
regions, is called Kusadvipa. Its master is Hiranyareta, another son of Maharaja Priyavrata, and its
inhabitants worship the Supreme personality of Godhead in the form of Agni, the fire-god. The width of
this island is 6,400,000 miles, or, in other words, twice the width of Salmalidvipa.
The fourth island, Krauncadvipa, which is surrounded by an ocean of milk, is 12,800,000 miles wide
and is also divided, like the others, into seven regions, each with a large mountain and a large river. The
master of this island is Ghrtaprstha, another son of Maharaja Priyavrata. The inhabitants of this island
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of water.
The fifth island, Sakadvipa, which is 25,600,000 miles wide, is surrounded by an ocean of yogurt. Its
master is Medhatithi, another son of Maharaja Priyavrata. It is also divided into seven regions, each with a
large mountain and a large river. Its inhabitants worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form
of Vayu, air.
The sixth island, Puskaradvipa, which is twice as wide as the previous island, is surrounded by an ocean
of clear water. Its master is Vitihotra, another son of Maharaja Priyavrata. The island is divided in two by a
large mountain named Manasottara. The inhabitants of this island worship Svayambhu, another feature of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Beyond Puskaradvipa there are two islands, one always lit by the
sunshine and the other always dark. Between them is a mountain called Lokaloka, which is situated one
billion miles from the edge of the universe. Lord Narayana, expanding His opulence, resides upon this
mountain. The area beyond Lokaloka Mountain is called Aloka-varsa, and beyond Aloka-varsa is the pure
destination of persons who desire liberation.
Vertically, the sun-globe is situated just in the middle of the universe, in Antariksa, the space between
Bhurloka and Bhuvarloka. The distance between the sun and the circumference of Anda-golaka, the globe
of the universe, is estimated to be twenty-five koti yojanas (two billion miles). Because the sun enters the
universe and divides the sky, it is known as Martanda, and because it is produced from Hiranyagarbha,
the body of the mahat-tattva, it is also called Hiranyagarbha.
