<h2>Translation</h2>
Gradually Maharaja Bharata became very affectionate toward the deer. He began to raise it and maintain
it by giving it grass. He was always careful to protect it from the attacks of tigers and other animals. When
it itched, he petted it, and in this way he always tried to keep it in a comfortable condition. He sometimes
kissed it out of love. Being attached to raising the deer, Maharaja Bharata forgot the rules and regulations
for the advancement of spiritual life, and he gradually forgot to worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. After a few days, he forgot everything about his spiritual advancement.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this we can understand how we have to be very cautious in executing our spiritual duties by
observing the rules and regulations and regularly chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. If we neglect
doing this, we will eventually fall down. We must rise early in the morning. bathe, attend mangala-arati,
worship the Deities, chant the Hare Krsna mantra, study the Vedic literatures and follow all the rules
prescribed by the acaryas and the spiritual master. If we deviate from this process, we may fall down, even
though we may be very highly advanced. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.5):
yajna-dana-tapah-karma
na tyajyam karyam eva tat
yajno danam tapas caiva
pavanani manisinam
"Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed. Indeed, sacrifice,
charity and penance purify even the great soul." Even if one is in the renounced order, he should never
give up the regulative principles. He should worship the Deity and give his time and life to the service of
Krsna. He should also continue following the rules and regulations of austerity and penance. These things
cannot be given up. One should not think oneself very advanced simply because one has accepted the
sannyasa order. The activities of Bharata Maharaja should be carefully studied for one's spiritual
advancement.
