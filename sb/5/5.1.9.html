<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma, the father of Narada Muni, is the supreme person within this universe. As soon as Narada
saw the great swan, he could understand that Lord Brahma had arrived. Therefore he immediately stood
up, along with Svayambhuva Manu and his son Priyavrata, whom Narada was instructing. Then they
folded their hands and began to worship Lord Brahma with great respect.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the previous verse, Lord Brahma was accompanied by other demigods, but his specific
carrier was the great swan. Therefore as soon as Narada Muni saw the swan, he could understand that his
father, Lord Brahma, who is also known as Hiranyagarbha, was arriving. Thus he immediately stood up
with Svayambhuva Manu and his son Priyavrata to receive Lord Brahma and offer him respect.
