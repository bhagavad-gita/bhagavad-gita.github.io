<h2>Translation</h2>
As I have advised you, My dear sons, you should act accordingly. Be very careful. By these means you
will be freed from the ignorance of the desire for fruitive activity, and the knot of bondage in the heart
will be completely severed. For further advancement, you should also give up the means. That is, you
should not become attached to the process of liberation itself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The process of liberation is brahma jijnasa, the search for the Absolute Truth. Generally brahma jijnasa
is called neti neti, the process by which one analyzes existence to search out the Absolute Truth. This
method continues as long as one is not situated in his spiritual life. Spiritual life is brahma-bhuta, the selfrealized
state. In the words of Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully
joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that
state. he attains pure devotional service unto Me."
The idea is to enter into the para bhakti, the transcendental devotional service of the Supreme Lord. To
attain this, one must analyze ones existence, but when one is actually engaged in devotional service, he
should not bother seeking out knowledge. By simply engaging in devotional service undeviatingly, one
will always remain in the liberated condition.
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
(Bg. 14.26)
The unflinching execution of devotional service is in itself brahma-bhuta. Another important feature in
this connection is anena yogena yathopadesam. The instructions received from the spiritual master must
be followed immediately. One should not deviate from or surpass the instructions of the spiritual master.
One should not be simply intent on consulting books but should simultaneously execute the spiritual
master's order (yathopadesam). Mystic power should be achieved to enable one to give up the material
conception, but when one actually engages in devotional service, one does not need to practice the mystic
yoga system. The point is that one can give up the practice of yoga, but devotional service cannot be given
up. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.7.10):
atmaramas ca munayo
nirgrantha apy urukrame
kurvanty ahaitukim bhaktim
ittham-bhuta-guno harih
Even those who are liberated (atmarama) must always engage in devotional service. One may give up
the practice of yoga when one is self-realized, but at no stage can one give up devotional service. All other
activities for self-realization, including yoga and philosophical speculation, may be given up, but
devotional service must be retained at all times.
