<h2>Translation</h2>
There are two kinds of ksetrajna--the living entity, as explained above, and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is explained as follows. He is the all-pervading cause of creation. He is full in Himself and
is not dependent on others. He is perceived by hearing and direct perception. He is self-effulgent and does
not experience birth, death, old age or disease. He is the controller of all the demigods, beginning with
Lord Brahma. He is called Narayana, and He is the shelter of living entities after the annihilation of this
material world. He is full of all opulences, and He is the resting place of everything material. He is
therefore known as Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His own potency, He is present
within the hearts of all living entities, just as the air or vital force is within the bodies of all beings,
moving and nonmoving. In this way He controls the body. In His partial feature, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead enters all bodies and controls them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15). Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam
apohanam ca. Every living being is controlled by the supreme living being, Paramatma, who resides
within everyone's heart. He is the purusa, the purusa-avatara, who creates this material world. The first
purusa-avatara is Maha-Visnu, and that Maha-Visnu is the plenary portion of the plenary portion of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Krsna's first expansion is Baladeva, and His next expansions are
Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Aniruddha and Pradyumna. Vasudeva is the original cause of the brahmajyoti, and
the brahmajyoti is the expansion of the rays of the body of Vasudeva.
yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-kotikotisv
asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam
tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of
His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which
displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of
universes." (Brahma-samhita 5.40) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is thus described in Bhagavadgita:
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in
them." (Bg. 9.4)
This is the position of the plenary expansions of Krsna as the all-pervading Vasudeva, Sankarsana,
Pradyumna and Aniruddha.
