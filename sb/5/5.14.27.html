TRANSLATION
In this materialistic life, there are many difficulties, as I have just mentioned, and all of these are
insurmountable. In addition, there are difficulties arising from so-called happiness, distress, attachment,
hate, fear, false prestige, illusion, madness, lamentation, bewilderment, greed, envy, enmity, insult,
hunger, thirst, tribulation, disease, birth, old age and death. All these combine together to give the
materialistic conditioned soul nothing but misery.
PURPORT
The conditioned soul has to accept all these conditions simply to enjoy sense gratification in this world.
Although people declare themselves great scientists, economists, philosophers, politicians and
sociologists. they are actually nothing but rascals. Therefore they have been described as mudhas and
naradhamas in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind. whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me."
Due to their foolishness, all these materialists are described in Bhagavad-gita as naradhamas. They have
attained the human form in order to get released from material bondage, but instead of doing so. they
become further embarrassed amid the miserable material conditions. Therefore they are naradhamas, the
lowest of men. One may ask whether scientists, philosophers, economists and mathematicians are also
naradhamas, the lowest of men, and the Supreme personality of Godhead replies that they are because
they have no actual knowledge. They are simply proud of their false prestige and position. Actually they
do not know how to get relief from the material condition and renovate their spiritual life of
transcendental bliss and knowledge. Consequently they waste time and energy in the search for so-called
happiness. These are the qualifications of the demons. In Bhagavad-gita it says that when one has all these
demonic qualities, he becomes a mudha. Due to this. he envies the Supreme personality of Godhead;
therefore birth after birth he is born into a demonic family, and he transmigrates from one demonic body
to another. Thus he forgets his relationship with Krsna and remains a naradhama in an abominable
condition life after life.
