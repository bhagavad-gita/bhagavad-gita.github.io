nisamya bhima-gaditam
draupadyas ca catur-bhujah
alokya vadanam sakhyur
idam aha hasann iva
SYNONYMS
nisamya--just after hearing; bhima--Bhima; gaditam--spoken by; draupadyah--of Draupadi; ca--and;
catuh-bhujah--the four-handed (Personality of Godhead); alokya--having seen; vadanam--the face;
sakhyuh--of His friend; idam--this; aha--said; hasan--smiling; iva--as it.
TRANSLATION
Caturbhuja [the four-armed one], or the Personality of Godhead, after hearing the words of Bhima,
Draupadi and others, saw the face of His dear friend Arjuna, and He began to speak as if smiling.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna had two arms, and why He is designated as four-armed is explained by Sridhara Svami.
Both Bhima and Draupadi held opposite views about killing Asvatthama. Bhima wanted him to be
immediately killed, whereas Draupadi wanted to save him. We can imagine Bhima ready to kill while
Draupadi is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of them, the Lord discovered another two
arms. Originally, the primeval Lord Sri Krsna displays only two arms, but in His Narayana feature He
exhibits four. In His Narayana feature He resides with His devotees in the Vaikuntha planets, while in His
original Sri Krsna feature He resides in the Krsnaloka planet far, far above the Vaikuntha planets in the
spiritual sky. Therefore, if Sri Krsna is called caturbhujah, there is no contradiction. If need be He can
display hundreds of arms, as He exhibited in His visva-rupa shown to Arjuna. Therefore, one who can
display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed.
When Arjuna was perplexed about what to do with Asvatthama, Lord Sri Krsna, as the very dear friend
of Arjuna, voluntarily took up the matter just to make a solution. And He was smiling also.
TEXTS 53-54

mayaivobhayam amnatam
paripahy anusasanam
kuru pratisrutam satyam
yat tat santvayata priyam
priyam ca bhimasenasya

SYNONYMS
sri-bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; uvaca--said; brahma-bandhuh--the relative of a brahmana;
na--not; hantavyah--to be killed; atatayi--the aggressor; vadha-arhanah--is due to be killed; maya--by Me;

out; anusasanam--rulings; kuru--abide by; pratisrutam--as promised by; satyam--truth; yat tat--that which;
santvayata--while pacifying; priyam--dear wife; priyam--satisfaction; ca--also; bhimasenasya--of Sri
Bhimasena; pancalyah--of Draupadi; mahyam--unto Me also; eva--certainly; ca--and.
TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna said: A friend of a brahmana is not to be killed, but if he is an
aggressor he must be killed. All these rulings are in the scriptures, and you should act accordingly. You
have to fulfill your promise to your wife, and you must also act to the satisfaction of Bhimasena and Me.
PURPORT
Arjuna was perplexed because Asvatthama was to be killed as well as spared according to different
scriptures cited by different persons. As a brahma-bandhu, or a worthless son of a brahmana, Asvatthama
was not to be killed, but he was at the same time an aggressor also. And according to the rulings of Manu,
an aggressor, even though he be a brahmana (and what to speak of an unworthy son of a brahmana), is to
be killed. Dronacarya was certainly a brahmana in the true sense of the term, but because he stood in the
battlefield he was killed. But although Asvatthama was an aggressor, he stood without any fighting
weapons. The ruling is that an aggressor, when he is without weapon or chariot, cannot be killed. All
these were certainly perplexities. Besides that, Arjuna had to keep the promise he had made before
Draupadi just to pacify her. And he also had to satisfy both Bhima and Krsna, who advised killing him.
This dilemma was present before Arjuna, and the solution was awarded by Krsna.
