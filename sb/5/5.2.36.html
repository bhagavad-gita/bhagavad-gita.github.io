TRANSLATION
While enjoying his material opulences with full strength and influence, Maharaja Priyavrata once began
to consider that although he had fully surrendered to the great saint Narada and was actually on the path
of Krsna consciousness, he had somehow become again entangled in material activities. Thus his mind
now became restless, and he began to speak in a spirit of renunciation.
PURPORT
In Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17) it is said:
tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer
bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim
ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah
"One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may
sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the
other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything." If one
somehow or other comes to the shelter of a great Vaisnava, takes to Krsna consciousness because of
sentiment or realization, but in course of time falls down because of immature understanding, he is not
actually fallen, for his having engaged in Krsna consciousness is a permanent asset. If one falls down,
therefore, his progress might be checked for a certain time, but it will again become manifest at an
opportune moment. Although Priyavrata Maharaja was serving according to the instructions of Narada
Muni meant for going back home, back to Godhead, he returned to material affairs at the request of his
father. In due course of time, however, his consciousness for serving Krsna reawakened by the grace of his
spiritual master, Narada.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.41), sucinam srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate. One who falls down
from the process of bhakti-yoga is again offered the opulence of the demigods, and after enjoying such
material opulence, he is given a chance to take birth in a noble family of a pure brahmana, or in a rich
family, to be given the chance to revive his Krsna consciousness. This actually happened in the life of
Priyavrata: he is a most glorious example of this truth. In due course of time, he no longer wanted to
enjoy his material opulences and his wife, kingdom and sons; instead, he wanted to renounce them all.
Therefore, after having described the material opulences of Maharaja Priyavrata, Sukadeva Gosvami, in
this verse, describes his tendency for renunciation.
The words devarsi-carananusayana indicate that Maharaja Priyavrata, having fully surrendered to the
great sage Devarsi Narada, was strictly following all the devotional processes and regulative principles
under his direction. In regard to strictly following the regulative principles, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura says; dandavat-pranamas tan anupatitah. By immediately offering obeisances (dandavat) unto the
spiritual master and by strictly following his directions, the student becomes advanced. Maharaja
Priyavrata was doing all these things regularly.
As long as one is in the material world, he has to be under the influence of the modes of material nature
(guna-visarga). It is not that Maharaja Priyavrata was freed from material influence because he possessed
all material opulences. In this material world, both the very poor man and the very rich man are under
material influences, for both wealth and poverty are creations of the modes of material nature. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (3.27), prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah. According to the modes of material
nature we acquire, the material nature gives us facility for material enjoyment.
