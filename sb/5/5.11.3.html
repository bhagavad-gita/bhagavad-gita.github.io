<h2>Text</h2>
tasmad bhavantam mama samsayartham
praksyami pascad adhuna subodham
adhyatma-yoga-grathitam tavoktam
akhyahi kautuhala-cetaso me
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; bhavantam--to you; mama--of me; samsaya-artham--the subject matter that is not
clear to me; praksyami--I shall submit; pascat--afterwards; adhuna--now; su-bodham--so that it can be
clearly understood; adhyatma-yoga--of mystic instruction for self-realization; grathitam--as composed;
tava--your; uktam--speech; akhyahi--please explain again; kautuhala-cetasah--whose mind is very
inquisitive to understand the mystery of such statements; me--to me.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Whatever doubts I have about a particular subject matter I shall ask you about later. For the time being,
these mysterious yoga instructions you have given me for self-realization appear very difficult to
understand. Please repeat them in a simple way so that I can understand them. My mind is very
inquisitive, and I want to understand this clearly.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic literature instructs: tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam. An intelligent man
must be very inquisitive to know the transcendental science deeply. Therefore one must approach a guru,
a spiritual master. Although Jada Bharata explained everything to Maharaja Rahugana, it appears that his
intelligence was not perfect enough to understand clearly. He therefore requested a further explanation.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.34): tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya. The student must approach
a spiritual master and surrender unto him fully (pranipatena). He must also question him in order to
understand his instructions (pariprasnena). One should not only surrender to the spiritual master but also
render loving service unto him (sevaya) so that the spiritual master will be pleased with the student and
explain the transcendental subject matter more clearly. A challenging spirit before the spiritual master
should be avoided if one is at all interested in learning the Vedic instructions in depth.
