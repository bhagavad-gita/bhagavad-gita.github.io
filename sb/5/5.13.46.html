<h2>Translation</h2>
Devotees interested in hearing and chanting [sravanam kirtanam] regularly discuss the pure
characteristics of Bharata Maharaja and praise his activities. If one submissively hears and chants about
the all-auspicious Maharaja Bharata, one's life span and material opulences certainly increase. One can
become very famous and easily attain promotion to the heavenly planets, or attain liberation by merging
into the existence of the Lord. Whatever one desires can be attained simply by hearing, chanting and
glorifying the activities of Maharaja Bharata. In this way, one can fulfill all his material and spiritual
desires. One does not have to ask anyone else for these things, for simply by studying the life of Maharaja
Bharata, one can attain all desirable things.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The forest of material existence is summarized in this Fourteenth Chapter. The word bhavatavi refers to
the path of material existence. The merchant is the living entity who comes to the forest of material
existence to try to make money for sense gratification. The six plunderers are the senses--eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, touch and mind. The bad leader is diverted intelligence. Intelligence is meant for Krsna
consciousness. but due to material existence we divert all our intelligence to achieve material facilities.
Everything belongs to Krsna, the Supreme personality of Godhead, but due to our perverted mind and
senses. we plunder the property of the Lord and engage in satisfying our senses. The jackals and tigers in
the forest are our family members, and the herbs and creepers are our material desires. The mountain cave
is our happy home, and the mosquitoes and serpents are our enemies. The rats, beasts and vultures are
different types of thieves who take away our possessions, and the gandharva-pura is the phantasmagoria
of the body and home. The will-o'-the-wisp is our attraction for gold and its color, and material residence
and wealth are the ingredients for our material enjoyment. The whirlwind is our attraction for our wife,
and the dust storm is our blinding passion experienced during sex. The demigods control the different
directions, and the cricket is the harsh words spoken by our enemy during our absence. The owl is the
person who directly insults us, and the impious trees are impious men. The waterless river represents
atheists who give us trouble in this world and the next. The meat-eating demons are the government
officials, and the pricking thorns are the impediments of material life. The little taste experienced in sex is
our desire to enjoy another's wife, and the flies are the guardians of women, like the husband, father-inlaw,
mother-in-law and so forth. The creeper itself is women in general. The lion is the wheel of time, and
the herons, crows and vultures are so-called demigods, pseudo svamis, yogis and incarnations. All of these
are too insignificant to give one relief. The swans are the perfect brahmanas, and the monkeys are the
extravagant sudras engaged in eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The trees of the monkeys are our
households, and the elephant is ultimate death. Thus all the constituents of material existence are
described in this chapter.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Material World as the Great Forest of Enjoyment."
Chapter Fifteen
The Glories of the Descendants of King Priyavrata
In this chapter the descendants of Bharata Maharaja and many other kings are described. The son of
Maharaja Bharata was named Sumati. He followed the path of liberation given by Rsabhadeva. Some
people mistakenly thought Sumati to be the direct incarnation of Lord Buddha. The son of Sumati was
Devatajit, and his son was Devadyumna. Devadyumna's son was Paramesthi, and his son was Pratiha.
Pratiha was a very great devotee of Lord Visnu, and he had three sons, named Pratiharta, Prastota and
Udgata. Pratiharta had two sons, Aja and Bhuma. The son of Bhuma was Udgitha, and the son of Udgitha
was Prastava. The son of Prastava was Vibhu, and the son of Vibhu was Prthusena, whose son was Nakta.
The wife of Nakta, Druti, gave birth to Gaya, who was a very famous and saintly king. Actually King Gaya
was a partial incarnation of Lord Visnu, and because of his great devotion to Lord Visnu he received the
title Mahapurusa. King Gaya had sons named Citraratha, Sumati and Avarodhana. The son of Citraratha
was the emperor Samrat, and his son was Marici, whose son was Bindu. Bindu's son was Madhu, and
Madhu's son was Viravrata. Viravrata's two sons were Manthu and Pramanthu, and the son of Manthu was
Bhauvana. The son of Bhauvana was Tvasta, and the son of Tvasta was Viraja, who glorified the whole
dynasty. Viraja had one hundred sons and one daughter. Of these, the son named Satajit became very
famous.
