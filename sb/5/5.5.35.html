<h2>Translation</h2>
O King Pariksit, just to show all the yogis the mystic process, Lord Rsabhadeva, the partial expansion of
Lord Krsna, performed wonderful activities. Actually He was the master of liberation and was fully
absorbed in transcendental bliss, which increased a thousandfold. Lord Krsna, Vasudeva, the son of
Vasudeva, is the original source of Lord Rsabhadeva. There is no difference in Their constitution, and
consequently Lord Rsabhadeva awakened the loving symptoms of crying, laughing and shivering. He was
always absorbed in transcendental love. Due to this, all mystic powers automatically approached Him,
such as the ability to travel in outer space at the speed of mind, to appear and disappear, to enter the
bodies of others, and to see things far, far away. Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these
powers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 19.149) it is said:
krsna-bhakta----niskama, ataeva 'santa'
bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kami----sakali 'asanta'
The word santa means completely peaceful. Unless all one's desires are fulfilled, one cannot be peaceful.
Everyone is trying to fulfill his aspirations and desires, be they material or spiritual. Those in the material
world are asanta (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however,
is without desire. Anyabhilasita-sunya: a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire.
Karmis, on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are
not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly. jnanis are always
aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. Yogis are aspiring after many siddhis
(powers)--anima, laghima, prapti, etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because
he is fully dependent on the mercy of Krsna. Krsna is yogesvara, the possessor of all mystic powers
(siddhis), and He is atmarama, fully self-satisfied. The yoga-siddhis are described in this verse. One can fly
in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as
soon as a yogi desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so
immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions
of miles. Sometimes yogis enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies
are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect yogi can find a young, able body. Giving
up his old body, the yogi can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion
of Lord Vasudeva, Lord Rsabhadeva possessed all these mystic yoga powers, but He was satisfied with His
devotional love of Krsna, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and
shivering.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fifth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam entitled
"Lord Rsabhadeva's Teachings to His Sons."
Chapter Six
The Activities of Lord Rsabhadeva
This chapter tells how Lord Rsabhadeva left His body. He was not attached to His body even when it
was being burned up in a forest fire. When the seed of fruitive activity is burned by the fire of knowledge,
the spiritual properties and mystic powers are automatically manifest, yet bhakti-yoga is not affected by
these mystic powers. An ordinary yogi is captivated by mystic powers and his progress checked; therefore
a perfect yogi does not welcome them. Because the mind is restless and undependable, it must remain
always under control. Even the mind of the advanced yogi Saubhari created such a disturbance that he
lost his yogic mystic powers. Due to a restless mind, even a very advanced yogi can fall down. The mind is
so restless that it induces even a perfect yogi to be controlled by the senses. Therefore Lord Rsabhadeva,
for the instruction of all yogis, showed the process of quitting the body. While traveling in South India,
through the provinces of Karnata, Konka, Venka and Kutaka, Lord Rsabhadeva arrived in the
neighborhood of Kutakacala. Suddenly there was a forest fire that burned the forest and Lord
Rsabhadeva's body to ashes. The pastimes of Lord Rsabhadeva as a liberated soul were known by the King
of Konka, Venka and Kutaka. This King's name was Arhat. He later became captivated by the illusory
energy, and in this condition he set forth the basic principles of Jainism. Lord Rsabhadeva set forth the
principles of religion that can free one from material bondage, and He put an end to all kinds of atheistic
activities. On this earth, the place known as Bharata-varsa was a very pious land because the Supreme
Lord appeared there when He wanted to incarnate.
Lord Rsabhadeva neglected all the mystic powers for which the so-called yogis hanker. Because of the
beauty of devotional service. devotees are not at all interested in so-called mystic power. The master of all
yogic power, Lord Krsna, can exhibit all powers on behalf of His devotee. Devotional service is more
valuable than yogic mystic powers. Devotees who are sometimes misled aspire for liberation and mystic
powers. The Supreme Lord gives these devotees whatever they desire, but they cannot attain the most
important function of devotional service. Devotional service to the Lord is guaranteed for those who do
not desire liberation and mystic power.
