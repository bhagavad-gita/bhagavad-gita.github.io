TRANSLATION
In the forest of material existence, the uncontrolled senses are like plunderers. The conditioned soul
may earn some money for the advancement of Krsna consciousness, but unfortunately the uncontrolled
senses plunder his money through sense gratification. The senses are plunderers because they make one
spend his money unnecessarily for seeing, smelling, tasting, touching, hearing, desiring and willing. In
this way the conditioned soul is obliged to gratify his senses, and thus all his money is spent. This money
is actually acquired for the execution of religious principles, but it is taken away by the plundering senses.
PURPORT
purva jamnarjita vidya purva janmarjitam dhanam agre dhavati dhavati. By following the principles of
the varnasrama-dharma, one attains a better position in the material world. One may be rich, learned,
beautiful or highborn. One who has all these assets should know that they are all meant for the
advancement of Krsna consciousness. Unfortunately, when a person is misguided he misuses his high
position for sense gratification. Therefore the uncontrolled senses are considered plunderers. The good
position one attains by executing religious principles is wasted as the plundering senses take it away. By
executing religious principles under the laws of varna-srama-dharma, one is placed in a comfortable
position. One may very easily use his assets for the further advancement of Krsna consciousness. One
should understand that the wealth and opportunity one gets in the material world should not be
squandered in sense gratification. They are meant for the advancement of Krsna consciousness. This
Krsna consciousness movement is therefore teaching people to control the mind and five knowledgeacquiring
senses by a definite process. One should practice a little austerity and not spend money on
anything other than the regulative life of devotional service. The senses demand that one see beautiful
things; therefore money should be spent for decorating the Deity in the temple. Similarly, the tongue has
to taste good food, which should be bought and offered to the Deity. The nose can be utilized in smelling
the flowers offered to the Deity, and the hearing can be utilized by listening to the vibration of the Hare
Krsna mantra. In this way the senses can be regulated and utilized to advance Krsna consciousness. Thus
a good position might not be spoiled by material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating,
intoxication and gambling. One spoils an opulent position in the material world by driving cars, spending
time in nightclubs or tasting abominable food in restaurants. In these ways. the plundering senses take
away all the assets that the conditioned soul has acquired with great difficulty.
