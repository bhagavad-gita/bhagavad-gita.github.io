<h2>Translation</h2>
In the body of a deer, Bharata Maharaja began to lament: What misfortune! I have fallen from the path
of the self-realized. I gave up my real sons, wife and home to advance in spiritual life, and I took shelter in
a solitary holy place in the forest. I became self-controlled and self-realized, and I engaged constantly in
devotional service, hearing, thinking, chanting, worshiping and remembering the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Vasudeva. I was successful in my attempt, so much so that my mind was always absorbed in
devotional service. However, due to my personal foolishness, my mind again became attached--this time
to a deer. Now I have obtained the body of a deer and have fallen far from my devotional practices.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Due to his stringent execution of devotional service. Maharaja Bharata could remember the activities of
his past life and how he was raised to the spiritual platform. Due to his foolishness, he became attached to
an insignificant deer and thus fell down and had to accept the body of a deer. This is significant for every
devotee. If we misuse our position and think that we are fully engaged in devotional service and can do
whatever we like, we have to suffer like Bharata Maharaja and be condemned to accept the type of body
that impairs our devotional service. Only the human form is able to execute devotional service, but if we
voluntarily give this up for sense gratification, we certainly have to be punished. This punishment is not
exactly like that endured by an ordinary materialistic person. By the grace of the Supreme Lord, a devotee
is punished in such a way that his eagerness to attain the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva is increased. By his
intense desire, he returns home in the next lifetime. Devotional service is very completely described here:
tad-anusravana-manana-sankirtanaradhananusmaranabhiyogena. The constant hearing and chanting of
the glories of the Lord is recommended in Bhagavad-gita: satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdhavratah.
Those who have taken to Krsna consciousness should be very careful that not a single moment is
wasted and that not a single moment is spent without chanting and remembering the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and His activities. By His own actions and by the actions of His devotees, Krsna teaches us
how to become cautious in devotional service. Through the medium of Bharata Maharaja, Krsna teaches
us that we must be careful in the discharge of devotional service. If we want to keep our minds completely
fixed without deviation, we must engage them in devotional service full time. As far as the members of the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness are concerned, they have sacrificed everything to push on
this Krsna consciousness movement. Yet they must take a lesson from the life of Bharata Maharaja to be
very cautious and to see that not a single moment is wasted in frivolous talk, sleep or voracious eating.
Eating is not prohibited, but if we eat voraciously we shall certainly sleep more than required. Sense
gratification ensues, and we may be degraded to a lower life form. In that way our spiritual progress may
be checked at least for the time being. The best course is to take the advice of Srila Rupa Gosvami:
avyartha-kalatvam. We should see that every moment of our lives is utilized for the rendering of
devotional service and nothing else. This is the secure position for one wanting to return home, back to
Godhead.
