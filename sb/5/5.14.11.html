<h2>Translation</h2>
Although King Gaya had no personal desire for sense gratification, all his desires were fulfilled by virtue
of his performance of Vedic rituals. All the kings with whom Maharaja Gaya had to fight were forced to
fight on religious principles. They were very satisfied with his fighting, and they would present all kinds
of gifts to him. Similarly, all the brahmanas in his kingdom were very satisfied with King Gaya's
munificent charities. Consequently the brahmanas contributed a sixth of their pious activities for King
Gaya's benefit in the next life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As a ksatriya or emperor, Maharaja Gaya sometimes had to fight with subordinate kings to maintain his
government, but the subordinate kings were not dissatisfied with him because they knew that he fought
for religious principles. Consequently they accepted their subordination and offered all kinds of gifts to
him. Similarly, the brahmanas who performed Vedic rituals were so satisfied with the King that they very
readily agreed to part with a sixth of their pious activities for his benefit in the next life. Thus the
brahmanas and ksatriyas were all satisfied with Maharaja Gaya because of his proper administration. In
other words. Maharaja Gaya satisfied the ksatriya kings by his fighting and satisfied the brahmanas by his
charities. The vaisyas were also encouraged by kind words and affectionate dealings, and due to Maharaja
Gaya's constant sacrifices, the sudras were satisfied by sumptuous food and charity. In this way Maharaja
Gaya kept all the citizens very satisfied. When brahmanas and saintly persons are honored, they part with
their pious activities, giving them to those who honor them and render them service. Therefore, as stated
in Bhagavad-gita (4.34), tad viddhi pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya: one should try to approach a
spiritual master submissively and render service unto him.
