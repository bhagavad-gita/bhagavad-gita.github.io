rajovaca
na nunam bhagava atmaramanam yoga-samirita-jnanavabharjita-karma-bijanam aisvaryani punah
klesadani bhavitum arhanti yadrc-chayopagatani.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
raja uvaca--King Pariksit inquired; na--not; nunam--indeed; bhagavah--O most powerful Sukadeva
Gosvami; atmaramanam--of pure devotees simply engaged in devotional service; yoga-samirita--achieved
by practice of yoga; jnana--by knowledge; avabharjita--burned; karma-bijanam--of those whose seeds of
fruitive activities; aisvaryani--the mystic powers; punah--again; klesadani--sources of distress; bhavitum--
to become; arhanti--are able; yadrcchaya--automatically; upagatani--achieved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pariksit asked Sukadeva Gosvami: My dear Lord, for those who are completely pure in heart,
knowledge is attained by the practice of bhakti-yoga, and attachment for fruitive activity is completely
burned to ashes. For such people, the powers of mystic yoga automatically arise. They do not cause
distress. Why, then, did Rsabhadeva neglect them?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee is constantly engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever is
necessary for the discharge of devotional service is automatically attained, though it may appear to be the
result of mystic yoga power. Sometimes a yogi displays a little yogic power by manufacturing gold. A little
quantity of gold captivates foolish people, and thus the yogi gets many followers, who are willing to
accept such a tiny person as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a yogi may also advertise himself
as Bhagavan. However, a devotee does not have to exhibit such magical wonders. Without practicing the
mystic yogic process, he achieves even greater opulence all over the world. Under the circumstances, Lord
Rsabhadeva refused to manifest mystic yogic perfections, and Maharaja Pariksit asked why He did not
accept them, since, for a devotee, they are not at all disturbing. A devotee is never distressed or satisfied
by material opulence. His concern is how to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, by the grace
of the Supreme Lord, a devotee achieves extraordinary opulence, he utilizes the opportunity for the Lord's
service. He is not disturbed by the opulence.
