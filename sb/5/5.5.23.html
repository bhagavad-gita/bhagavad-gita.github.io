na brahmanais tulaye bhutam anyat
pasyami viprah kim atah param tu
yasmin nrbhih prahutam sraddhayaham

pasyami--I can see; viprah--O assembled brahmanas; kim--anything; atah--to the brahmanas; param--
superior; tu--certainly; yasmin--through whom; nrbhih--by people; prahutam--food offered after ritualistic

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O respectful brahmanas, as far as I am concerned, no one is equal or superior to the brahmanas in this
world. I do not find anyone comparable to them. When people know My motive after performing rituals
according to the Vedic principles, they offer food to Me with faith and love through the mouth of a
brahmana. When food is thus offered unto Me, I eat it with full satisfaction. Indeed, I derive more
pleasure from food offered in that way than from the food offered in the sacrificial fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, after the sacrificial ceremony the brahmanas are invited to eat the
remnants of the offered food. When the brahmanas eat the food, it is to be considered directly eaten by
the Supreme Lord. Thus no one can be compared to qualified brahmanas. The perfection of evolution is to
be situated on the brahminical platform. Any civilization not based on brahminical culture or guided by
brahmanas is certainly a condemned civilization. Presently human civilization is based on sense
gratification, and consequently more and more people are becoming addicted to different types of things.
No one respects brahminical culture. Demoniac civilization is attached to ugra-karma, horrible activities.
and big industries are created to satisfy unfathomable lusty desires. Consequently the people are greatly
harassed by governmental taxation. The people are irreligious and do not perform the sacrifices
recommended in Bhagavad-gita. Yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by the performance of sacrifice, clouds form
and rain falls. Due to sufficient rainfall, there is sufficient production of food. Guided by the brahmanas,
society should follow the principles of Bhagavad-gita. Then people will become very happy. Annad
bhavanti bhutani: when animals and man are sufficiently fed with grains, they become stronger, their
hearts become tranquil and their brains peaceful. They can then advance in spiritual life, life's ultimate
destination.
