<h2>Translation</h2>
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hrsikesa, the
controller of all my senses and the origin of everything. As the supreme master of all bodily, mental and
intellectual activities, He is the only enjoyer of their results. The five sense objects and eleven senses,
including the mind, are His partial manifestations. He supplies all the necessities of life, which are His
energy and thus nondifferent from Him, and He is the cause of everyone's bodily and mental prowess,
which is also nondifferent from Him. Indeed, He is the husband and provider of necessities for all living
entities. The purpose of all the Vedas is to worship Him. Therefore let us all offer Him our respectful
obeisances. May He always be favorable toward us in this life and the next.
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word mayamaya is further explained in regard to how the Lord expands His mercy in
different ways. parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate: the energies of the Supreme Lord are understood in
different ways. In this verse He is described as the original source of everything, even our body, senses,
mind, activities, prowess, bodily strength, mental strength and determination for securing the necessities
of life. Indeed, the Lord's energies can be perceived in everything. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.8), raso
'ham apsu kaunteya: the taste of water is also Krsna. Krsna is the active principle of everything we need
for our maintenance.
This verse offering respectful obeisances unto the Lord was composed by Rama, the goddess of fortune,
and is full of spiritual power. Under the guidance of a spiritual master, everyone should chant this mantra
and thus become a complete and perfect devotee of the Lord. One may chant this mantra for complete
liberation from material bondage, and after liberation one may continue to chant it while worshiping the
Supreme Lord in Vaikunthaloka. All mantras, of course, are meant for this life and the next life, as Krsna
Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.14):
satatam kirtayanto mam
yatantas ca drdha-vratah
namasyantas ca mam bhaktya
nitya-yukta upasate
"Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, the great
souls perpetually worship Me with devotion." A devotee who both in this life and the next chants the
maha-mantra, or any mantra, is called nitya-yuktopasaka.
