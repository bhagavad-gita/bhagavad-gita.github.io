<h2>Translation</h2>
A householder who receives guests or visitors with cruel glances, as if to burn them to ashes, is put into
the hell called Paryavartana, where he is gazed at by hard-eyed vultures, herons, crows and similar birds,
which suddenly swoop down and pluck out his eyes with great force.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic etiquette, even an enemy who comes to a householder's home should be
received in such a gentle way that he forgets that he has come to the home of an enemy. A guest who
comes to one's home should be received very politely. If he is unwanted, the householder should not stare
at him with blinking eyes, for one who does so will be put into the hell known as Paryavartana after
death, and there many ferocious birds like vultures, crows, and coknis will suddenly come upon him and
pluck out his eyes.
