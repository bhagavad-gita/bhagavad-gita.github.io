<h2>Translation</h2>
Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Rsabhadeva was fully independent
because His form was spiritual, eternal and full of transcendental bliss. He eternally had nothing to do
with the four principles of material misery [birth, death, old age and disease]. Nor was He materially
attached. He was always equipoised, and He saw everyone on the same level. He was unhappy to see
others unhappy, and He was the well-wisher of all living entities. Although He was a perfect personality,
the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul.
Therefore He strictly followed the principles of varnasrama-dharma and acted accordingly. In due course
of time, the principles of varnasrama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal
characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the varnasramadharma.
In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop
religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and
finally eternal life. By His instructions, He showed how people could remain householders and at the
same time become perfect by following the principles of varnasrama-dharma.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The varnasrama-dharma is meant for imperfect, conditioned souls. It trains them to become spiritually
advanced in order to return home, back to Godhead. A civilization that does not know the highest aim of
life is no better than an animal society. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam: na te viduh svartha-gatim hi
visnum. A human society is meant for elevation to spiritual knowledge so that all of the people can be
freed from the clutches of birth, death, old age and disease. The varnasrama-dharma enables human
society to become perfectly fit for getting out of the clutches of maya, and by following the regulative
principles of varnasrama-dharma, one can become successful. In this regard, see Bhagavad-gita (3.21-24).
