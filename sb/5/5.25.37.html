<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Pariksit, in the province of Yamaraja there are hundreds and thousands of hellish planets.
The impious people I have mentioned--and also those I have not mentioned--must all enter these various
planets according to the degree of their impiety. Those who are pious, however, enter other planetary
systems, namely the planets of the demigods. Nevertheless, both the pious and impious are again brought
to earth after the results of their pious or impious acts are exhausted.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This corresponds to the beginning of Lord Krsna's instructions in Bhagavad-gita. Tatha dehantarapraptih:
within this material world, one is simply meant to change from one body to another in different
planetary systems. Urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha: those in the mode of goodness are elevated to the
heavenly planets. Adho gacchanti tamasah: similarly, those too engrossed in ignorance enter the hellish
planetary systems. Both of them, however, are subjected to the repetition of birth and death. In Bhagavadgita
it is stated that even one who is very pious returns to earth after his enjoyment in the higher planetary
systems is over (ksine punye martya-lokam visanti). Therefore, going from one planet to another does not
solve the problems of life. The problems of life will only be solved when we no longer have to accept a
material body. This can be possible if one simply becomes Krsna conscious. As Krsna says in Bhagavadgita
(4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." This is the
perfection of life and the real solution to life's problems. We should not be eager to go to the higher,
heavenly planetary systems, nor should we act in such a way that we have to go to the hellish planets. The
complete purpose of this material world will be fulfilled when we resume our spiritual identities and go
back home, back to Godhead. The very simple method for doing this is prescribed by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. One should be neither pious
nor impious. One should be a devotee and surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna. This surrendering process
is also very easy. Even a child can perform it. Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru.
One must always simply think of Krsna by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare.
Hare Rama. Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. One should become Krsna's devotee. worship Him and
offer obeisances to Him. Thus one should engage all the activities of his life in the service of Lord Krsna.
