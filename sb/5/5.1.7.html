<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: The first created being and most powerful demigod in this universe is
Lord Brahma, who is always responsible for developing universal affairs. Born directly from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he dedicates his activities to the welfare of the entire universe, for he knows the
purpose of the universal creation. This supremely powerful Lord Brahma, accompanied by his associates
and the personified Vedas, left his own abode in the highest planetary system and descended to the place
of Prince Priyavrata's meditation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Visnu, the Supreme Self (atma), is the source of everything, as explained in the Vedanta-sutra:
janmady asya yatah. Because Brahma was born directly from Lord Visnu, he is called atma-yoni. He is also
called bhagavan, although generally bhagavan refers to the Supreme personality of Godhead (Visnu or
Lord Krsna). Sometimes great personalities--such as demigods like Lord Brahma, Narada or Lord Siva--are
also addressed as bhagavan because they carry out the purpose of the Supreme personality of Godhead.
Lord Brahma is called bhagavan because he is the secondary creator of this universe. He is always thinking
of how to improve the situation of the conditioned souls who have come to the material world to enjoy
material activities. For this reason, he disseminates the Vedic knowledge throughout the universe for
everyone's guidance.
Vedic knowledge is divided into two parts: pravrtti-marga and nivrtti-marga. Nivrtti-marga is the path of
negating sense enjoyment, and pravrtti-marga is the path by which the living entities are given a chance to
enjoy and at the same time are directed in such a way that they can go back home, back to Godhead.
Because ruling over this universe is a great responsibility, Brahma must force many Manus in different
ages to take charge of universal affairs. Under each Manu there are different kings who also execute the
purpose of Lord Brahma. It is understood from previous explanations that the father of Dhruva Maharaja,
King Uttanapada, ruled over the universe because his elder brother, Priyavrata, practiced austerity from
the very beginning of his life. Thus up to the point of the Pracetas, the kings of the universe were all
descendants of Uttanapada Maharaja. Since there were no suitable kings after the Pracetas, Svayambhuva
Manu went to the Gandhamadana Hill to bring back his eldest son, Priyavrata, who was meditating there.
Svayambhuva Manu requested Priyavrata to rule over the universe. When he refused, Lord Brahma
descended from the supreme planetary system, known as Satyaloka, to request Priyavrata to accept the
order. Lord Brahma did not come alone. He came with other great sages like Marici, Atreya and Vasistha.
To convince Priyavrata that it was necessary for him to follow the Vedic injunctions and accept the
responsibility of ruling over the world, Lord Brahma also brought with him the personified Vedas, his
constant associates.
A significant word in this verse is sva-bhavanat, indicating that Lord Brahma descended from his own
abode. Every demigod has his own abode. Indra, the King of the demigods, has his own abode, as do
Candra, the lord of the moon planet, and Surya, the predominating deity of the sun planet. There are
many millions of demigods, and the stars and planets are their respective homes. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita. Yanti deva-vrata devan: "Those who worship the demigods go to their different planetary
systems." Lord Brahma's abode. the highest planetary system, is called Satyaloka or sometimes
Brahmaloka. Brahmaloka usually refers to the spiritual world. The abode of Lord Brahma is Satyaloka, but
because Lord Brahma resides there, it is also sometimes called Brahmaloka.
