<h2>Translation</h2>
No one likes to possess anything that is like a will-o'-the-wisp or a flower in the sky, for everyone knows
very well that such things do not exist. When Lord Rsabhadeva ruled this planet of Bharatavarsa, even
common men did not want to ask for anything, at any time or by any means. No one ever asks for a willo'-
the-wisp. In other words, everyone was completely satisfied, and therefore there was no chance of
anyone's asking for anything. The people were absorbed in great affection for the King. Since this affection
was always expanding, they were not inclined to ask for anything.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bengal the word ghoda-dimba is used, which means "the egg of a horse." Since a horse never lays an
egg, the word ghoda-dimba actually has no meaning. In Sanskrit there is a word kha-puspa, which means
"the flower in the sky." No flower grows in the sky; therefore no one is interested in asking for kha-puspa
or ghoda-dimba. During the reign of Maharaja Rsabhadeva, people were so well equipped that they did
not want to ask for anything. They were immensely supplied with all necessities for life due to King
Rsabhadeva's good government. Consequently everyone felt full satisfaction and did not want anything.
This is the perfection of government. If the citizens are unhappy due to bad government, the heads of
government are condemned. During these democratic days, monarchy is disliked by the people, but here
is an example of how an emperor of the whole world kept all the citizens fully satisfied by supplying the
necessities of life and following the Vedic principles. Thus everyone was happy during the reign of
Maharaja Rsabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
