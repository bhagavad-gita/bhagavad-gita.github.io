harir hi saksad bhagavan saririnam
atma jhasanam iva toyam ipsitam
hitva mahams tam yadi sajjate grhe
tada mahattvam vayasa dampatinam
SYNONYMS
harih--the Lord; hi--certainly; saksat--directly; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
saririnam--of all living entities who have accepted material bodies; atma--the life and soul; jhasanam--of
the aquatics; iva--like; toyam--the vast water; ipsitam--is desired; hitva--giving up; mahan--a great
personality; tam--Him; yadi--if; sajjate--becomes attached; grhe--to household life; tada--at that time;
mahattvam--greatness; vayasa--by age; dam-patinam--of the husband and wife.
TRANSLATION
Just as aquatics always desire to remain in the vast mass of water, all conditioned living entities
naturally desire to remain in the vast existence of the Supreme Lord. Therefore if someone very great by
material calculations fails to take shelter of the Supreme Soul but instead becomes attached to material
household life, his greatness is like that of a young, low-class couple. One who is too attached to material
life loses all good spiritual qualities.
PURPORT
Although crocodiles are very fierce animals, they are powerless when they venture out of the water onto
land. When they are out of the water, they cannot exhibit their original power. Similarly, the all-pervading
Supersoul, Paramatma, is the source of all living entities, and all living entities are part and parcel of Him.
When the living entity remains in contact with the all-pervading Vasudeva, the Personality of Godhead,
he manifests his spiritual power, exactly as the crocodile exhibits its strength in the water. In other words,
the greatness of the living entity can be perceived when he is in the spiritual world, engaged in spiritual
activities. Many householders, although well-educated in the knowledge of the Vedas, become attached to
family life. They are compared herein to crocodiles out of water, for they are devoid of all spiritual
strength. Their greatness is like that of a young husband and wife who, though uneducated, praise one
another and become attracted to their own temporary beauty. This kind of greatness is appreciated only
by low-class men with no qualifications.
Everyone should therefore seek the shelter of the Supreme Soul, the source of all living entities. No one
should waste his time in the so-called happiness of materialistic household life. In the Vedic civilization,
this type of crippled life is allowed only until one's fiftieth year, when one must give up family life and
enter either the order of vanaprastha (independent retired life for cultivation of spiritual knowledge) or
sannyasa (the renounced order, in which one completely takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead).
