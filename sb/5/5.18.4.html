<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, whose pure form [sac-cid-ananda-vigraha] is uncontaminated by the modes of material
nature, can be perceived by pure consciousness. In the Vedanta He is described as being one without a
second. Because of His spiritual potency, He is untouched by the contamination of material nature, and
because He is not subjected to material vision, He is known as transcendental. He has no material
activities, nor has He a material form or name. Only in pure consciousness, Krsna consciousness, can one
perceive the transcendental form of the Lord. Let us be firmly fixed at the lotus feet of Lord Ramacandra,
and let us offer our respectful obeisances unto those transcendental lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears in various expansions, as stated in the Brahmasamhita
(5.39):
ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan
nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu
krsnah svayam samabhavat paramah puman yo
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is always situated in various
incarnations such as Rama, Nrsimha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original
personality of Godhead known as Krsna and who incarnates personally also." Krsna, who is visnu-tattva,
has expanded Himself in many Visnu forms, of which Lord Ramacandra is one. We know that the visnutattva
is carried by the transcendental bird Garuda and is equipped with different types of weapons in four
hands. Therefore we may doubt whether Lord Ramacandra could be in the same category, since He was
carried by Hanuman, not by Garuda, and had neither four hands nor the sankha, cakra, gada and padma.
Consequently this verse clarifies that Ramacandra is as good as Krsna (ramadi-murtisu kala). Although
Krsna is the original Supreme personality of Godhead, Ramacandra is not different from Him.
Ramacandra is unaffected by the modes of material nature, and therefore He is prasanta, never disturbed
by those modes.
Unless one is saturated with love for the Supreme personality of Godhead, one cannot appreciate the
transcendental value of Lord Ramacandra; one cannot see Him with material eyes. Because demons like
Ravana have no spiritual vision, they consider Lord Ramacandra an ordinary ksatriya king. Ravana
therefore attempted to kidnap Lord Ramacandra's eternal consort, Sitadevi. Actually, however, Ravana
could not carry off Sitadevi in her original form. As soon as she was touched by Ravana's hands, she gave
him a material form, but she maintained her original form beyond his vision. Therefore in this verse the
words pratyak prasantam indicate that Lord Ramacandra and His potency, the goddess Sita, keep
themselves aloof from the influence of the material energy.
In the Upanisads it is said: yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyah. The Supreme Lord, Paramatma, the
Personality of Godhead, can be seen or perceived only by persons who are saturated with devotional
service. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with
the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee."
Similarly, in the Chandogya Upanisad it is stated, etas tisro devata anena jivena. In this verse of the
Chandogya Upanisad the word anena is used to distinguish the atma and Paramatma as two separate
identities. The words tisro devata indicate that the body of the living entity is made of three material
elements--fire, earth and water. Although the Paramatma enters the heart of the jivatma, who is
influenced and designated by a material body, the Paramatma has nothing to do with the jivatma's body.
Because the Paramatma has no material connections, He is described here as anama-rupam niraham. The
Paramatma has no material identity, whereas the jivatma does. The jivatma may introduce himself as an
Indian, American, German and so on, but the Paramatma has no such material designations, and therefore
He has no material name. The jivatma is different from his name, but the Paramatma is not; His name and
He Himself are one and the same. This is the meaning of niraham, which means "without material
designations." This word cannot possibly be twisted to mean that the Paramatma has no ahankara, no "Iness"
or identity. He has His transcendental identity as the Supreme. This is the explanation given by Srila
Jiva Gosvami. According to another interpretation, given by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, niraham
means nirniscayena aham. Niraham does not mean that the Supreme Lord has no identity. Rather, the
stress given by the word aham proves strongly that He does have His personal identity because nir not
only means "negative" but also means "strong ascertainment."
