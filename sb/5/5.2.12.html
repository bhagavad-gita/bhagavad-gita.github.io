<h2>Translation</h2>
O best friend, will you kindly show me the place where you reside? I cannot imagine how the residents
of that place have gotten such wonderful bodily features as your raised breasts, which agitate the mind
and eyes of a person like me who sees them. Judging by the sweet speech and kind smiles of those
residents, I think that their mouths must contain nectar.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Still bewildered, Agnidhra wanted to see the place from which the brahmana boy had come, where the
men had such raised breasts. Such attractive features, he thought, must be due to the severe austerities
performed there. Agnidhra addressed the girl as suhrttama, the best friend, so that she would not refuse to
take him there. Not only was Agnidhra captivated by the girl's raised breasts; he was also attracted by her
sweet speech. Nectar seemed to emanate from her mouth, and therefore he was increasingly surprised.
