<h2>Translation</h2>
Like a honeybee, the Apsara smelled the beautiful and attractive flowers. She could attract the minds
and vision of both humans and demigods by her playful movements, her shyness and humility, her
glances, the very pleasing sounds that poured from her mouth as she spoke, and the motion of her limbs.
By all these qualities, she opened for Cupid, who bears an arrow of flowers, a path of aural reception into
the minds of men. When she spoke, nectar seemed to flow from her mouth. As she breathed, the bees,
mad for the taste of her breath, tried to hover about her beautiful lotuslike eyes. Disturbed by the bees,
she tried to move hastily, but as she raised her feet to walk quickly, her hair, the belt on her hips, and her
breasts, which were like water jugs, also moved in a way that made her extremely beautiful and attractive.
Indeed, she seemed to be making a path for the entrance of Cupid, who is most powerful. Therefore the
prince, completely subdued by seeing her, spoke to her as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
How a beautiful woman's movements and gestures, her hair and the structure of her breasts, hips and
other bodily features attract the minds not only of men but of demigods also is very finely described in
this statement. The words divija and manuja specifically emphasize that the attraction of feminine
gestures is powerful everywhere within this material world, both on this planet and in the higher
planetary systems. It is said that the standard of living in the higher planetary systems is thousands and
thousands of times higher than the standard of living on this planet. Therefore the beautiful bodily
features of the women there are also thousands and thousands of times more attractive than the features
of the women on earth. The creator has constructed women in such a way that their beautiful voices and
movements and the beautiful features of their hips, their breasts, and the other parts of their bodies attract
the members of the opposite sex, both on earth and on other planets, and awaken their lusty desires.
When one is controlled by Cupid or the beauty of women, he becomes stunned like matter such as stone.
Captivated by the material movements of women, he wants to remain in this material world. Thus one's
promotion to the spiritual world is checked simply by seeing the beautiful bodily structure and
movements of women. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore warned all devotees to beware of the
attraction of beautiful women and materialistic civilization. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu even refused to see
Prataparudra Maharaja because he was a very opulent person in the material world. Lord Caitanya said in
this connection, niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: those who are engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord because they are very serious about going back home, back to Godhead, should be
very careful to avoid seeing the beautiful gestures of women and should also avoid seeing persons who are
very rich.
niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya
param param jigamisor bhava-sagarasya
sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca
ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato 'py asadhu
"Alas, for a person who is seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense
gratification or seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison
willingly." (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 11.8) One who is serious about going back home, back to
Godhead, should not contemplate the attractive features of women and the opulence of rich men. Such
contemplation will check one's advancement in spiritual life. Once a devotee is fixed in Krsna
consciousness, however, these attractions will not agitate his mind.
