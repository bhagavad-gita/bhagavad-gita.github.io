<h2>Translation</h2>
All the rogues and thieves who had made arrangements for the worship of goddess Kali were low
minded and bound to the modes of passion and ignorance. They were overpowered by the desire to
become very rich; therefore they had the audacity to disobey the injunctions of the Vedas, so much so that
they were prepared to kill Jada Bharata, a self-realized soul born in a brahmana family. Due to their envy,
these dacoits brought him before the goddess Kali for sacrifice. Such people are always addicted to
envious activities, and therefore they dared to try to kill Jada Bharata. Jada Bharata was the best friend of
all living entities. He was no one's enemy, and he was always absorbed in meditation on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. He was born of a good brahmana father, and killing him was forbidden, even
though he might have been an enemy or aggressive person. In any case, there was no reason to kill Jada
Bharata, and the goddess Kali could not bear this. She could immediately understand that these sinful
dacoits were about to kill a great devotee of the Lord. Suddenly the deity's body burst asunder, and the
goddess Kali personally emerged from it in a body burning with an intense and intolerable effulgence.
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic injunctions, only an aggressor can be killed. If a person comes with an intent to
kill, one can immediately take action and kill in self-defense. It is also stated that one can be killed if he
comes to set fire to the home or to pollute or kidnap one's wife. Lord Ramacandra killed the entire family
of Ravana because Ravana kidnapped His wife, Sitadevi. However, killing is not sanctioned in the sastras
for other purposes. The killing of animals in sacrifice to the demigods, who are expansions of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is sanctioned for those who eat meat. This is a kind of restriction for
meat-eating. In other words, the slaughter of animals is also restricted by certain rules and regulations in
the Vedas. Considering these points, there was no reason to kill Jada Bharata, who was born in a
respectable, highly exalted brahmana family. He was a God-realized soul and a well-wisher to all living
entities. The Vedas did not at all sanction the killing of Jada Bharata by rogues and thieves. Consequently
the goddess Bhadra Kali emerged from the deity to give protection to the Lord's devotee. Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura explains that due to the Brahman effulgence of such a devotee as Jada Bharata, the
deity was fractured. Only thieves and rogues in the modes of passion and ignorance and maddened by
material opulence offer a man in sacrifice before the goddess Kali. This is not sanctioned by the Vedic
instructions. Presently there are many hundreds and thousands of slaughterhouses throughout the world
that are maintained by a puffed-up population mad for material opulence. Such activities are never
supported by the Bhagavata school.
