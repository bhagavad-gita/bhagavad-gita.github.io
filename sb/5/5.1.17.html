<h2>Text</h2>
bhayam pramattasya vanesv api syad
yatah sa aste saha-sat-sapatnah
jitendriyasyatma-rater budhasya
grhasramah kim nu karoty avadyam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhayam--fear; pramattasya--of one who is bewildered; vanesu--in forests; api--even; syat--there must be;
yatah--because; sah--he (one who is not self-controlled); aste--is existing; saha--with; sat-sapatnah--six cowives;
jita-indriyasya--for one who has already conquered the senses; atma-rateh--self-satisfied;
budhasya--for such a learned man; grha-asramah--household life; kim--what; nu--indeed; karoti--can do;
avadyam--harm.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even if he goes from forest to forest, one who is not self-controlled must always fear material bondage
because he is living with six co-wives--the mind and knowledge-acquiring senses. Even householder life,
however, cannot harm a self-satisfied, learned man who has conquered his senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung, grhe va vanete thake, 'ha gauranga' bale dake: whether one is
situated in the forest or at home, if he is engaged in the devotional service of Lord Caitanya, he is a
liberated person. Here this is also repeated. For one who has not controlled his senses, going to the forest
to become a so-called yogi is meaningless. Because his uncontrolled mind and senses are going with him,
he cannot achieve anything, even by giving up household life and staying in the forest. Formerly many
mercantile men from the up-country of India used to go to Bengal, and thus there is a familiar saying, "If
you go to Bengal, your fortune will go with you." Our first concern, therefore, should be to control the
senses, and since the senses cannot be controlled unless engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, our
most important duty is to engage the senses in devotional service. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir
ucyate: bhakti means engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord.
Herein Lord Brahma indicates that instead of going to the forest with uncontrolled senses, it is better
and more secure to engage the senses in the service of the Lord. Even household life can do no harm to a
self-controlled person acting in this way; it cannot force him into material bondage. Srila Rupa Gosvami
has further enunciated this position:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"Regardless of one's circumstances, if one fully engages his activities, mind and words in the devotional
service of the Lord, he should be understood to be a liberated person." Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura was a
responsible officer and a householder, yet his service to the cause of expanding the mission of Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is unique. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati Thakura says, durdantendriya-kala-sarpapatali
protkhata-damstrayate. The sense organs are certainly our greatest enemies, and they are therefore
compared to venomous serpents. However, if a venomous serpent is bereft of its poison fangs, it is no
longer fearful. Similarly, if the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, there is no need to fear their
activities. The devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement move within this material world, but
because their senses are fully engaged in the service of the Lord, they are always aloof from the material
world. They are always living in a transcendental position.
