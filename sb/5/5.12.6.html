<h2>Text</h2>
kvacid vitoyah sarito 'bhiyati
parasparam calasate nirandhah
asadya davam kvacid agni-tapto
nirvidyate kva ca yaksair hrtasuh
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kvacit--sometimes; vitoyah--without depth to the water; saritah--rivers; abhiyati--he goes to bathe or
jumps into; parasparam--one another; ca--and; alasate--desires; nirandhah--being with no stock of food;
asadya--experiencing; davam--a forest fire in family life; kvacit--sometimes; agni-taptah--burned by fire;
nirvidyate--is despondent; kva--somewhere; ca--and; yaksaih--by kings resembling rogues and thieves;
hrta--taken away; asuh--wealth. which is as dear as one's life.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes the conditioned soul jumps into a shallow river, or being short of food grains, he goes to beg
food from people who are not at all charitable. Sometimes he suffers from the burning heat of household
life, which is like a forest fire, and sometimes he becomes sad to have his wealth, which is as dear as life,
plundered by kings in the name of heavy income taxes.
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one is hot due to the scorching sun, one sometimes jumps into a river to gain relief. However, if
the river is almost dried up and the water is too shallow, one may break his bones by jumping in. The
conditioned soul is always experiencing miserable conditions. Sometimes his efforts to get help from
friends are exactly like jumping into a dry river. By such actions, he does not derive any benefit. He only
breaks his bones. Sometimes, suffering from a shortage of food, one may go to a person who is neither
able to give charity nor willing to do so. Sometimes one is stationed in household life, which is compared
to a forest fire (samsara-davanala-lidha-loka). When a man is heavily taxed by the government, he
becomes very sad. Heavy taxation obliges one to hide his income, but despite this endeavor the
government agents are often so vigilant and strong that they take all the money anyway, and the
conditioned soul becomes very aggrieved.
Thus people are trying to become happy within the material world, but this is like trying to be happy in
a forest fire. No one need go to a forest to set it ablaze: fire takes place automatically. Similarly, no one
wants to be unhappy in family life or worldly life, but by the laws of nature unhappiness and distress are
forced upon everyone. To become dependent on another's maintenance is very degrading; therefore,
according to the Vedic system, everyone should live independently. Only the sudras are unable to live
independently. They are obliged to serve someone for maintenance. It is said in the sastras: kalau sudrasambhavah.
In this age of Kali, everyone is dependent on another's mercy for the maintenance of the
body; therefore everyone is classified as a sudra. In the Twelfth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said that
in Kali-yuga the government will levy taxes without reciprocally benefiting the citizens. Anavrstya
vinanksyanti durbhiksa-kara-piditah. In this age there will also be a shortage of rain; therefore a scarcity
of food will arise, and the citizens will be very much harassed by government taxation. In this way the
citizens will abandon their attempts to lead a peaceful life and will leave their homes and hearths and go
to the forest in sheer disappointment.
