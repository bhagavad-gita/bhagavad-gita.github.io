<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pariksit then told Sukadeva Gosvami: My dear lord, O great devotee sage, you are omniscient. You
have very nicely described the position of the conditioned soul, who is compared to a merchant in the
forest. From these instructions intelligent men can understand that the senses of a person in the bodily
conception are like rogues and thieves in that forest, and one's wife and children are like jackals and other
ferocious animals. However, it is not very easy for the unintelligent to understand the purport of this story
because it is difficult to extricate the exact meaning from the allegory. I therefore request Your Holiness to
give the direct meaning.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many stories and incidents in Srimad-Bhagavatam that are described figuratively. Such
allegorical descriptions may not be understood by unintelligent men; therefore it is the duty of the student
to approach a bona fide spiritual master for the direct explanation.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "Further Talks Between King Rahugana and Jada Bharata."
Chapter Fourteen
The Material World as the Great Forest of Enjoyment
The direct meaning of the forest of material existence is given in this chapter. Merchants sometimes
enter the forest to collect many rare things and sell them at a good profit in the city, but the forest path is
always bedecked with dangers. When the pure soul wants to give up the Lord's service to enjoy the
material world, Krsna certainly gives him a chance to enter the material world. As stated in the premavivarta:
krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga vancha kare. This is the reason the pure spirit soul falls down to
the material world. Due to his activities under the influence of the three modes of material nature, the
living entity takes different positions in different species. Sometimes he is a demigod in the heavenly
planets and sometimes a most insignificant creature in the lower planetary systems. In this regard, Srila
Narottama dasa Thakura says, nana yoni sada phire: the living entity passes through various species.
Kardarya bhaksana kare: he is obliged to eat and enjoy abominable things. Tara janma adhah-pate yaya: in
this way his whole life is spoiled. Without the protection of an all-merciful Vaisnava. the conditioned soul
cannot get out of the clutches of maya. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani
karsati), the living entity begins material life with his mind and the five knowledge-acquiring senses, and
with these he struggles for existence within the material world. These senses are compared to rogues and
thieves within the forest. They take away a man's knowledge and place him in a network of nescience.
Thus the senses are like rogues and thieves that plunder his spiritual knowledge. Over and above this,
there are family members, wife and children. who are exactly like ferocious animals in the forest. The
business of such ferocious animals is to eat a man's flesh. The living entity allows himself to be attacked
by jackals and foxes (wife and children), and thus his real spiritual life is finished. In the forest of material
life, everyone is envious like mosquitoes, and rats and mice are always creating disturbances. Everyone in
this material world is placed in many awkward positions and surrounded by envious people and
disturbing animals. The result is that the living entity in the material world is always plundered and bitten
by many living entities. Nonetheless, despite these disturbances, he does not want to give up his family
life, and he continues his fruitive activities in an attempt to become happy in the future. He thus becomes
more and more entangled in the results of karma, and thus he is forced to act impiously. His witnesses are
the sun during the day and the moon during the night. The demigods also witness, but the conditioned
soul thinks that his attempts at sense gratification are not being witnessed by anyone. Sometimes, when
he is detected, he temporarily renounces everything, but due to his great attachment for the body, his
renunciation is given up before he can attain perfection.
In this material world there are many envious people. There is the tax-exacting government, which is
compared to an owl, and there are invisible crickets that create unbearable sounds. The conditioned soul
is certainly greatly harassed by the agents of material nature, but his intelligence is lost due to undesirable
association. In an attempt to gain relief from the disturbances of material existence, he falls victim to socalled
yogis, sadhus and incarnations who can display some magic but who do not understand devotional
service. Sometimes the conditioned soul is bereft of all money, and consequently he becomes unkind to
his family members. In this material world there is not a pinch of actual happiness, for which the
conditioned soul is longing life after life. The government officials are like carnivorous Raksasas who
exact heavy taxes for the maintenance of the government. The hard-working conditioned soul is very
saddened due to these heavy taxes.
The path of fruitive activities leads to difficult mountains, and sometimes the conditioned soul wants to
cross these mountains, but he is never successful, and consequently he becomes more and more aggrieved
and disappointed. Becoming materially and financially embarrassed, the conditioned soul unnecessarily
chastises his family. In the material condition there are four principal needs, out of which sleep is
compared to a python. When asleep, the conditioned soul completely forgets his real existence, and in
sleep he does not feel the tribulations of material life. Sometimes, being in need of money, the conditioned
soul steals and cheats, although he may apparently be associated with devotees for spiritual advancement.
His only business is getting out of the clutches of maya, but due to improper guidance he becomes more
and more entangled in material dealings. This material world is simply an embarrassment and is
composed of tribulations presented as happiness. distress, attachment, enmity and envy. On the whole it
is simply full of tribulation and misery. When a person loses his intelligence due to attachment to wife
and sex, his entire consciousness becomes polluted. He thus only thinks of the association of women. The
time factor, which is like a serpent, takes away everyone's life, including that of Lord Brahma and the
insignificant ant. Sometimes the conditioned soul tries to save himself from inexorable time and thus
takes shelter of some bogus savior. Unfortunately. the bogus savior cannot even save himself. How, then.
can he protect others? The bogus saviors do not care for bona fide knowledge received from qualified
brahmanas and Vedic sources. Their only business is indulging in sex and recommending sexual freedom
even for widows. Thus they are like monkeys in the forest. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami thus explains the
material forest and its difficult path to Maharaja Pariksit.
