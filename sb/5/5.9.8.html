<h2>Translation</h2>
Thinking himself a king, King Rahugana was in the bodily conception and was influenced by material
nature's modes of passion and ignorance. Due to madness, he chastised Jada Bharata with uncalled-for and
contradictory words. Jada Bharata was a topmost devotee and the dear abode of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Although considering himself very learned, the King did not know about the position of an
advanced devotee situated in devotional service, nor did he know his characteristics. Jada Bharata was the
residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; he always carried the form of the Lord within his heart.
He was the dear friend of all living beings, and he did not entertain any bodily conception. He therefore
smiled and spoke the following words.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The distinction between a person in the bodily conception and a person beyond the bodily conception is
presented in this verse. In the bodily conception, King Rahugana considered himself a king and chastised
Jada Bharata in so many unwanted ways. Being self-realized, Jada Bharata, who was fully situated on the
transcendental platform, did not at all become angry; instead, he smiled and began to deliver his teachings
to King Rahugana. A highly advanced Vaisnava devotee is a friend to all living entities, and consequently
he is a friend to his enemies also. In fact, he does not consider anyone to be his enemy. Suhrdah sarvadehinam.
Sometimes a Vaisnava becomes superficially angry at a nondevotee, but this is good for the
nondevotee. We have several examples of this in Vedic literature. Once Narada became angry with the
two sons of Kuvera, Nalakuvara and Manigriva, and he chastised them by turning them into trees. The
result was that later they were liberated by Lord Sri Krsna. The devotee is situated on the absolute
platform, and when he is angry or pleased, there is no difference, for in either case he bestows his
benediction.
