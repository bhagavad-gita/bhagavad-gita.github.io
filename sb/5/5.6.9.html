<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued speaking to Maharaja Pariksit: My dear King, the King of Konka, Venka
and Kutaka whose name was Arhat, heard of the activities of Rsabhadeva and, imitating Rsabhadeva's
principles, introduced a new system of religion. Taking advantage of Kali-yuga, the age of sinful activity,
King Arhat, being bewildered, gave up the Vedic principles, which are free from risk, and concocted a
new system of religion opposed to the Vedas. That was the beginning of the Jain dharma. Many other socalled
religions followed this atheistic system.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Lord Sri Krsna was present on this planet, a person named Paundraka imitated the four-handed
Narayana and declared himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He desired to compete with Krsna.
Similarly, during the time of Lord Rsabhadeva, the King of Konka and Venka acted like a paramahamsa
and imitated Lord Rsabhadeva. He introduced a system of religion and took advantage of the fallen
condition of the people in this age of Kali. It is said in Vedic literatures that people in this age will be
more inclined to accept anyone as the Supreme Lord and accept any religious system opposed to Vedic
principles. The people in this age are described as mandah sumanda-matayah. Generally they have no
spiritual culture, and therefore they are very fallen. Due to this, they will accept any religious system. Due
to their misfortune. they forget the Vedic principles. Following non-Vedic principles in this age. they
think themselves the Supreme Lord and thus spread the cult of atheism all over the world.
