<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Rsabhadeva's hands, feet and chest were very long. His shoulders, face and limbs were all very
delicate and symmetrically proportioned. His mouth was beautifully decorated with His natural smile, and
He appeared all the more lovely with His reddish eyes spread wide like the petals of a newly grown lotus
flower covered with dew in the early morning. The irises of His eyes were so pleasing that they removed
all the troubles of everyone who saw Him. His forehead, ears, neck, nose and all His other features were
very beautiful. His gentle smile always made His face beautiful, so much so that He even attracted the
hearts of married women. It was as though they had been pierced by arrows of Cupid. About His head was
an abundance of curly, matted brown hair. His hair was disheveled because His body was dirty and not
taken care of. He appeared as if He were haunted by a ghost.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although Lord Rsabhadeva's body was very much neglected, His transcendental features were so
attractive that even married women were attracted to Him. His beauty and dirtiness combined to make
His beautiful body appear as though it were haunted by a ghost.
