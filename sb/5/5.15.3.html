<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavato gunamaye sthula-rupa avesitam mano hy agune 'pi suksmatama atma-jyotisi pare brahmani
bhagavati vasudevakhye ksamam avesitum tad u haitad guro 'rhasy anuvarnayitum iti.
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavatah--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; guna-maye--into the external features, consisting
of the three modes of material nature; sthula-rupe--the gross form; avesitam--entered; manah--the mind;
hi--indeed; agune--transcendental; api--although; suksmatame--in His smaller form as Paramatma within
the heart; atma-jyotisi--who is full of Brahman effulgence; pare--the supreme; brahmani--spiritual entity;
bhagavati--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vasudeva-akhye--known as Bhagavan Vasudeva;
ksamam--suitable; avesitum--to absorb; tat--that; u ha--indeed; etat--this; guro--O my dear spiritual
master; arhasi anuvarnayitum--please describe factually; iti--thus.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the mind is fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His external feature made of the
material modes of nature--the gross universal form--it is brought to the platform of pure goodness. In that
transcendental position, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who in His
subtler form is self-effulgent and beyond the modes of nature. O my lord, please describe vividly how that
form, which covers the entire universe, is perceived.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit had already been advised by his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, to think of the
universal form of the Lord, and therefore, following the advice of his spiritual master, he continuously
thought of that form. The universal form is certainly material, but because everything is an expansion of
the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, ultimately nothing is material. Therefore Pariksit
Maharaja's mind was saturated with spiritual consciousness. Srila Rupa Gosvami has stated:
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
Everything, even that which is material, is connected with the Supreme personality of Godhead.
Therefore everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura translates this verse as follows:
hari-sevaya yaha haya anukula
visaya baliya tahara tyage haya bhula
"One should not give up anything connected with the Supreme personality of Godhead, thinking it
material or enjoyable for the material senses." Even the senses, when purified, are spiritual. When
Maharaja Pariksit was thinking of the universal form of the Lord, his mind was certainly situated on the
transcendental platform. Therefore although he might not have had any reason to be concerned with
detailed information of the universe, he was thinking of it in relationship with the Supreme Lord, and
therefore such geographical knowledge was not material but transcendental. Elsewhere in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.5.20) Narada Muni has said, idam hi visvam bhagavan ivetarah: the entire universe is also
the Supreme personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him. Therefore although Pariksit
Maharaja had no need for geographical knowledge of this universe, that knowledge was also spiritual and
transcendental because he was thinking of the entire universe as an expansion of the energy of the Lord.
In our preaching work also, we deal with so much property and money and so many books bought and
sold, but because these dealings all pertain to the Krsna consciousness movement, they should never be
considered material. That one is absorbed in thoughts of such management does not mean that he is
outside of Krsna consciousness. If one rigidly observes the regulative principle of chanting sixteen rounds
of the maha-mantra every day, his dealings with the material world for the sake of spreading the Krsna
consciousness movement are not different from the spiritual cultivation of Krsna consciousness.
