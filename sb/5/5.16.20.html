<h2>Translation</h2>
For persons with impure vision, the Supreme Lord's eyes appear like those of someone who
indiscriminately drinks intoxicating beverages. Thus bewildered, such unintelligent persons become
angry at the Supreme Lord, and due to their angry mood the Lord Himself appears angry and very fearful.
However, this is an illusion. When the wives of the serpent demon were agitated by the touch of the
Lord's lotus feet, due to shyness they could proceed no further in their worship of Him. Yet the Lord
remained unagitated by their touch, for He is equipoised in all circumstances. Therefore who will not
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead ?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Anyone who remains unagitated, even in the presence of cause for agitation, is called dhira, or
equipoised. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being always in a transcendental position, is never
agitated by anything. Therefore someone who wants to become dhira must take shelter of the lotus feet of
the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (2.13) Krsna says, dhiras tatra na muhyati: a person who is equipoised in all
circumstances is never bewildered. Prahlada Maharaja is a perfect example of a dhira. When the fierce
form of Nrsimhadeva appeared in order to kill Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada was unagitated. He remained calm
and quiet, whereas others, including even Lord Brahma, were frightened by the features of the Lord.
