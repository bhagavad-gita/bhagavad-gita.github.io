<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, as the original boar within this universe, You fought and killed the great demon Hiranyaksa.
Then You lifted me [the earth] from the Garbhodaka Ocean on the end of Your tusk, exactly as a sporting
elephant plucks a lotus flower from the water. I bow down before You.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "The prayers Offered to the Lord by the Residents of Jambudvipa."
Chapter Nineteen
A Description of the Island of Jambudvipa
This chapter describes the glories of Bharata-varsa, and it also describes how Lord Ramacandra is being
worshiped in the tract of land known as Kimpurusa-varsa. The inhabitants of Kimpurusa-varsa are
fortunate because they worship Lord Ramacandra with His faithful servant Hanuman. Lord Ramacandra
exemplifies an incarnation of Godhead who descends for the mission of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca
duskrtam--protecting the devotees and destroying the miscreants. Lord Ramacandra exhibits the actual
purpose of an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the devotees take the opportunity
to offer loving transcendental service to Him. One should surrender fully to the Lord, forgetting one's socalled
material happiness, opulence and education, which are not at all useful for pleasing the Lord. The
Lord is pleased only by the process of surrender unto Him.
When Devarsi Narada descended to instruct Sarvani Manu, he described the opulence of Bharata-varsa,
India. Sarvani Manu and the inhabitants of Bharata-varsa engage in devotional service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is the origin of creation, maintenance and annihilation and who is always
worshiped by self-realized souls. In the planet known as Bharata-varsa there are many rivers and
mountains, as there are in other tracts of land, yet Bharata-varsa has special significance because in this
tract of land there exists the Vedic principle of varnasrama-dharma, which divides society into four varnas
and four asramas. Furthermore, Narada Muni's opinion is that even if there is some temporary
disturbance in the execution of the varnasrama-dharma principles, they can be revived at any moment.
The effect of adhering to the institution of varnasrama is gradual elevation to the spiritual platform and
liberation from material bondage. By following the principles of varnasrama-dharma, one gets the
opportunity to associate with devotees. Such association gradually awakens one's dormant propensity to
serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and frees one from all the basic principles of sinful life. One
then gets the opportunity to offer unalloyed devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Vasudeva. Because of
this opportunity, the inhabitants of Bharata-varsa are praised even in the heavenly planets. Even in the
topmost planet of this universe, Brahmaloka, the position of Bharata-varsa is discussed with great relish.
All the conditioned living entities are evolving within the universe in different planets and different
species of life. Thus one may be elevated to Brahmaloka, but then one must again descend to earth, as
confirmed in Srimad Bhagavad-gita (abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna). If those who live in
Bharata-varsa rigidly follow the principles of varnasrama-dharma and develop their dormant Krsna
consciousness, they need not return to this material world after death. Any place where one cannot hear
about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from realized souls, even if it be Brahmaloka, is not very
congenial to the living entity. If one who has taken birth in the land of Bharata-varsa as a human being
does not take advantage of the opportunity for spiritual elevation, his position is certainly the most
miserable. In the land known as Bharatavarsa, even if one is a sarva-kama-bhakta, a devotee seeking the
fulfillment of some material desire, he is freed from all material desires by his association with devotees,
and ultimately he becomes a pure devotee and returns home, back to Godhead, without difficulty.
At the end of this chapter, Sri Sukadeva Gosvami describes to Maharaja Pariksit the eight sub-islands
within the island of Jambudvipa.
