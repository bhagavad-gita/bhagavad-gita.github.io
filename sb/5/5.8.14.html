TRANSLATION
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness. He illuminates the entire universe
and bestows all benedictions upon His devotees. The Lord has created this universe from His own
spiritual potency. According to His desire, the Lord entered this universe as the Supersoul, and by virtue
of His different potencies, He is maintaining all living entities desiring material enjoyment. Let me offer
my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is the giver of intelligence."
PURPORT
The predominating Deity of the sun is another expansion of Narayana. who is illuminating the entire
universe. The Lord enters the hearts of all living entities as the Supersoul, and He gives them intelligence
and fulfills their material desires. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivistah. "I am sitting in everyone's heart." (Bg. 15.15)
As the Supersoul, the Lord enters the hearts of all living entities. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.35),
andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: "He enters the universe and the atom as well." In the Rg Veda,
the predominating Deity of the sun is worshiped by, this mantra: dhyeyah sada savitr-mandala-madhyavarti
narayanah sarasijasana-sannivistah. Narayana sits on His lotus flower within the sun. By reciting this
mantra, every living entity should take shelter of Narayana just as the sun rises. According to modern
scientists, the material world rests on the sun's effulgence. Due to the sunshine, all planets are rotating
and vegetables are growing. We also have information that the moonshine helps vegetables and herbs
grow. Actually Narayana within the sun is maintaining the entire universe; therefore Narayana should be
worshiped by the Gayatri mantra or the Rg mantra.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The activities of King Bharata."
Chapter Eight
A Description of the Character of Bharata Maharaja
Although Bharata Maharaja was very elevated, he fell down due to his attachment to a young deer. One
day after Bharata Maharaja had taken his bath as usual in the River Gandaki and was chanting his mantra,
he saw a pregnant deer come to the river to drink water. Suddenly there could be heard the thundering
roar of a lion, and the deer was so frightened that it immediately gave birth to its calf. It then crossed the
river, but died immediately thereafter. Maharaja Bharata took compassion upon the motherless calf,
rescued it from the water, took it to his asrama and cared for it affectionately. He gradually became
attached to this young deer and always thought of it affectionately. As it grew up, it became Maharaja
Bharata's constant companion, and he always took care of it. Gradually he became so absorbed in thinking
of this deer that his mind became agitated. As he became more attached to the deer, his devotional service
slackened. Although he was able to give up his opulent kingdom, he became attached to the deer. Thus he
fell down from his mystic yoga practice. Once when the deer was absent, Maharaja Bharata was so
disturbed that he began to search for it. While searching and lamenting the deer's absence, Maharaja
Bharata fell down and died. Because his mind was fully absorbed thinking of the deer, he naturally took
his next birth from the womb of a deer. However, because he was considerably advanced spiritually, he
did not forget his past activities, even though he was in the body of a deer. He could understand how he
had fallen down from his exalted position, and remembering this, he left his mother deer and again went
to Pulaha-asrama. He finally ended his fruitive activities in the form of a deer, and when he died he was
released from the deer's body.
