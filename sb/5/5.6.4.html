<h2>Text</h2>
nityam dadati kamasya
cchidram tam anu ye 'rayah
yoginah krta-maitrasya
patyur jayeva pumscali
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nityam--always; dadati--gives; kamasya--of lust; chidram--facility; tam--that (lust); anu--following; ye--
those; arayah--enemies; yoginah--of the yogis or persons trying to advance in spiritual life; krtamaitrasya--
having put faith in the mind; patyuh--of the husband; jaya iva--like the wife; pumscali--who is
unchaste or easily carried away by other men.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
An unchaste woman is very easily carried away by paramours, and it sometimes happens that her
husband is violently killed by her paramours. If the yogi gives his mind a chance and does not restrain it,
his mind will give facility to enemies like lust, anger and greed, and they will doubtlessly kill the yogi.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word pumscali refers to a woman who is easily carried away by men. Such a woman is
never to be trusted. Unfortunately, in the present age, women are never controlled. According to the
directions of the sastras, women are never to be given freedom. When a child, a woman must be strictly
controlled by her father. When she is young, she must be strictly controlled by her husband, and when
she is old, she must be controlled by her elderly sons. If she is given independence and allowed to mingle
unrestrictedly with men, she will be spoiled. A spoiled woman, being manipulated by paramours, might
even kill her husband. This example is given here because a yogi desiring to get free from material
conditions must always keep his mind under control. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura used to say
that in the morning our first business should be to beat the mind with shoes a hundred times. and, before
going to bed, to beat the mind a hundred times with a broomstick. In this way one's mind can be kept
under control. An uncontrolled mind and an unchaste wife are the same. An unchaste wife can kill her
husband at any time, and an uncontrolled mind, followed by lust, anger, greed, madness, envy and
illusion, can certainly kill the yogi. When the yogi is controlled by the mind, he falls down into the
material condition. One should be very careful of the mind, just as a husband should be careful of an
unchaste wife.
