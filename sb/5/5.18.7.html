<h2>Text</h2>
na janma nunam mahato na saubhagam
na van na buddhir nakrtis tosa-hetuh
tair yad visrstan api no vanaukasas
cakara sakhye bata laksmanagrajah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; janma--birth in a very polished, aristocratic family; nunam--indeed; mahatah--of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; na--nor; saubhagam--great fortune; na--nor; vak--an elegant manner of speaking;
na--nor; buddhih--sharpness of intelligence; na--not; akrtih--features of the body; tosa-hetuh--the cause of
pleasure to the Lord; taih--by all those above-mentioned qualities; yat--because; visrstan--rejected; api--
although; nah--us; vana-okasah--the inhabitants of the forest; cakara--accepted; sakhye--in friendship;
bata--alas; laksmana-agra-jah--Lord Sri Ramacandra, the elder brother of Laksmana.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One cannot establish a friendship with the Supreme Lord Ramacandra on the basis of material qualities
such as one's birth in an aristocratic family, one's personal beauty, one's eloquence, one's sharp
intelligence or one's superior race or nation. None of these qualifications is actually a prerequisite for
friendship with Lord Sri Ramacandra. Otherwise how is it possible that although we uncivilized
inhabitants of the forest have not taken noble births, although we have no physical beauty and although
we cannot speak like gentlemen, Lord Ramacandra has nevertheless accepted us as friends?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In a prayer to Krsna expressing her feelings, Srimati Kuntidevi called Him akincana-gocara. The prefix a
means "not," and kincana "something of this material world." One may be very proud of his prestigious
position, material wealth, beauty, education and so on, but although these are certainly good
qualifications in material dealings, they are not necessary for achieving friendship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. One who possesses all these material qualities is expected to become a devotee,
and when he actually does, the qualities are properly utilized. Those who are puffed up by a high birth,
wealth, education and personal beauty (janmaisvarya-sruta-sri) unfortunately do not care for developing
Krsna consciousness, nor does the Supreme Personality of Godhead care about all these material
qualifications. The Supreme Lord is achieved by devotion (bhaktya mam abhijanati). One's devotion and
sincere desire to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead are the only qualifications. Rupa Gosvami has
also said that the price for achieving God's favor is simply one's sincere eagerness to have it (laulyam
ekam mulyam). In the Caitanya-bhagavata it is said:
kholaveca sevakera dekha bhagya-sima
brahma siva kande yara dekhiya mahima
dhane jane panditye krsna nahi pai
kevala bhaktira vasa caitanya-gosani
"Behold the great fortune of the devotee Kholaveca. Lord Brahma and Siva shed tears upon seeing his
greatness. One cannot attain Lord Krsna by any amount of wealth, followers, or learning. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is controlled only by pure devotion. "Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very sincere
devotee whose name was Kholaveca Sridhara and whose only business was to sell pots made of the skin of
banana trees. Whatever income he had, he used fifty percent for the worship of mother Ganges, and with
the other fifty percent he provided for his necessities. On the whole, he was so very poor that he lived in a
cottage that had a broken roof with many holes in it. He could not afford brass utensils, and therefore he
drank water from an iron pot. Nevertheless, he was a great devotee of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. He
is a typical example of how a poor man with no material possessions can become a most exalted devotee
of the Lord. The conclusion is that one cannot attain shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna or Sri Caitanya
Gosani through material opulence; that shelter is attainable only by pure devotional service.
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service."
