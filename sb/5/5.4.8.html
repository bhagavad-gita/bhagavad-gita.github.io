<h2>Translation</h2>
After Nabhi Maharaja departed for Badarikasrama, the Supreme Lord, Rsabhadeva, understood that His
kingdom was His field of activities. He therefore showed Himself as an example and taught the duties of a
householder by first accepting brahmacarya under the direction of spiritual masters. He also went to live
at the spiritual masters' place, gurukula. After His education was finished, He gave gifts (guru-daksina) to
His spiritual masters and then accepted the life of a householder. He took a wife named Jayanti and begot
one hundred sons who were as powerful and qualified as He Himself. His wife Jayanti had been offered to
Him by Indra, the King of heaven. Rsabhadeva and Jayanti performed householder life in an exemplary
way, carrying out ritualistic activities ordained by the sruti and smrti sastra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Rsabhadeva had nothing to do with
material affairs. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the purpose of
an incarnation is to liberate His devotees and to stop the demoniac activities of nondevotees. These are the
two functions of the Supreme Lord when He incarnates. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said that in order
to preach, one must live a practical life and show people how to do things. Apani acari' bhakti sikhaimu
sabare. One cannot teach others unless he behaves the same way himself. Rsabhadeva was an ideal king,
and He took His education in the gurukula, although He was already educated because the Supreme Lord
is omniscient. Although Rsabhadeva had nothing to learn from gurukula, He went there just to teach the
people in general how to take an education from the right source, from Vedic teachers. He then entered
householder life and lived according to the principles of Vedic knowledge--sruti and smrti. In his Bhaktirasamrta-
sindhu (1.2.10) Srila Rupa Gosvami, quoting the Skanda purana, states:
sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-
vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
Human society must follow the instructions received from sruti and smrti, Vedic literature. Practically
applied in life this is worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the pancaratrika-vidhi.
Every human being must advance his spiritual life and at the end return home, back to Godhead.
Maharaja Rsabhadeva strictly followed all these principles. He remained an ideal grhastha and taught His
sons how to become perfect in spiritual life. These are some examples of how He ruled the earth and
completed His mission as an incarnation.
