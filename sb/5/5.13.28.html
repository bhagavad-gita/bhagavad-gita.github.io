<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes the conditioned soul is attracted by illusion personified (his wife or girl friend) and becomes
eager to be embraced by a woman. Thus he loses his intelligence as well as knowledge of life's goal. At
that time, no longer attempting spiritual cultivation, he becomes overly attached to his wife or girl friend
and tries to provide her with a suitable apartment. Again, he becomes very busy under the shelter of that
home and is captivated by the talks, glances and activities of his wife and children. In this way he loses his
Krsna consciousness and throws himself in the dense darkness of material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the conditioned soul is embraced by his beloved wife, he forgets everything about Krsna
consciousness. The more he becomes attached to his wife, the more he becomes implicated in family life.
One Bengali poet, Bankim Chandra, says that to the eyes of the lover the beloved is always very beautiful,
even though ugly. This attraction is called deva-maya. The attraction between man and woman is the
cause of bondage for both. Actually both belong to the para prakrti, the superior energy of the Lord, but
both are actually prakrti (female). However, because both want to enjoy one another, they are sometimes
described as purusa (male). Actually neither is purusa, but both can be superficially described as purusa.
As soon as man and woman are united, they become attached to home, hearth, land, friendship and
money. In this way they are both entrapped in material existence. The word bhuja-lata-upagudha,
meaning "being embraced by beautiful arms which are compared to creepers," describes the way the
conditioned soul is bound within this material world. The products of sex life--sons and daughters--
certainly follow. This is the way of material existence.
