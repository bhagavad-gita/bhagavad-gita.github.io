<h2>Text</h2>
tatrapi niravarodhah svairena viharann ati-krpana-buddhir anyonya-mukha-niriksanadina gramyakarmanaiva
vismrta-kalavadhih.
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra api--in that condition (in the society of human beings descended from monkeys); niravarodhah--
without hesitation; svairena--independently, without reference to the goal of life; viharan--enjoying like
monkeys; ati-krpana-buddhih--whose intelligence is dull because he does not properly utilize his assets;
anyonya--of one another; mukha-niriksana-adina--by seeing the faces (when a man sees the beautiful face
of a woman and the woman sees the strong build of the man's body, they always desire one another);
gramya-karmana--by material activities for sense gratification; eva--only; vismrta--forgotten; kalaavadhih--
the limited span of life (after which one's evolution may be degrading or elevating).
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way the descendants of the monkeys intermingle with each other, and they are generally known
as sudras. Without hesitating, they live and move freely, not knowing the goal of life. They are captivated
simply by seeing the faces of one another, which remind them of sense gratification. They are always
engaged in material activities, known as gramya-karma, and they work hard for material benefit. Thus
they forget completely that one day their small life spans will be finished and they will be degraded in the
evolutionary cycle.
PURPORT
Materialistic people are sometimes called sudras, or descendants of monkeys, due to their monkeylike
intelligence. They do not care to know how the evolutionary process is taking place, nor are they eager to
know what will happen after they finish their small human life span. This is the attitude of sudras. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission, this Krsna consciousness movement, is trying to elevate sudras to the
brahmana platform so that they will know the real goal of life. Unfortunately, being overly attached to
sense gratification, materialists are not serious in helping this movement. Instead, some of them try to
suppress it. Thus it is the business of monkeys to disturb the activities of the brahmanas. The descendants
of monkeys completely forget that they have to die, and they are very proud of scientific knowledge and
the progress of material civilization. The word gramya-karmana indicates activities meant only for the
improvement of bodily comforts. presently all human society is engaged in improving economic
conditions and bodily comforts. people are not interested in knowing what is going to happen after death,
nor do they believe in the transmigration of the soul. When one scientifically studies the evolutionary
theory, one can understand that human life is a junction where one may take the path of promotion or
degradation. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.25):
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitrn yanti pitr-vratah
bhutani yanti bhutejya
yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam
"Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and
spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who
worship Me will live with Me."
In this life we have to prepare ourselves for promotion to the next life. Those who are in the mode of
rajo-guna are generally interested in being promoted to the heavenly planets. Some, unknowingly, are
degraded to lower animal forms. Those in the mode of goodness can engage in devotional service, and
after that they can return home, back to Godhead (yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam). That is the real purpose of
human life. This Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring intelligent human beings to the
platform of devotional service. Instead of wasting time trying to attain a better position in material life,
one should simply endeavor to return home, back to Godhead. Then all problems will be solved. As stated
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti su-hrt-satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses the desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the
devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted."
One simply has to follow the regulative principles, act like a brahmana, chant the Hare Krsna mantra
and read Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. In this way one purifies himself of the baser material
modes (tamo-guna and rajo-guna) and, becoming freed from the greed of these modes, can attain
complete peace of mind. In this way one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and one's
relationship with Him and thus be promoted to the highest perfection (siddhim paramam gatah).
