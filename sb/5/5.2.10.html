<h2>Text</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vacam--the resounding vibration; param--only; carana-panjara--of the ankle bells; tittirinam--of the
tittiri birds; brahman--O brahmana; arupa--without form; mukharam--able to be very distinctly heard;
srnavama--I hear; tubhyam--your; labdha--gotten; kadamba--like the kadamba flower; rucih--lovely color;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O brahmana, I can simply hear the tinkling of your ankle bells. Within those bells, tittiri birds seem to
be chirping among themselves. Although I do not see their forms, I can hear how they are chirping. When
I look at your beautiful circular hips, I see they are the lovely color of kadamba flowers, and your waist is
encircled by a belt of burning cinders. Indeed, you seem to have forgotten to dress yourself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
With lusty desires to see Purvacitti, Agnidhra especially gazed upon the girl's attractive hips and waist.
When a man looks upon a woman with such lusty desires, he is captivated by her face, her breasts and her
waist, for a woman first attracts a man to fulfill his sexual desires by the beautiful features of her face, by
the beautiful slope of her breasts and also by her waist. Purvacitti was dressed in fine yellow silk, and
therefore her hips looked like kadamba flowers. Because of her belt, her waist seemed to be encircled by
burning cinders. She was fully dressed, but Agnidhra had become so lusty that he asked, "Why have you
come naked?"
