TRANSLATION
My dear King Pariksit, because Lord Brahma had finally descended from Satyaloka to Bhuloka, Narada
Muni, Prince Priyavrata and Svayambhuva Manu came forward to offer him objects of worship and to
praise him in highly qualified language, according to Vedic etiquette. At that time, Lord Brahma, the
original person of this universe, felt compassion for Priyavrata and, looking upon him with a smiling face,
spoke to him as follows.
PURPORT
That Lord Brahma descended from Satyaloka to see Priyavrata indicates that the matter was very serious.
Narada Muni had come to advise Priyavrata about the value of spiritual life, knowledge, renunciation and
bhakti, and Lord Brahma knew that Narada's instructions were very impressive. Therefore unless Lord
Brahma personally went to Gandhamadana Hill to request Priyavrata, Lord Brahma knew that prince
Priyavrata would not accept his father's order. Brahma's purpose was to break Priyavrata's determination.
Therefore Brahma first looked upon Priyavrata with compassion. His smile and compassionate features
also indicated that although Brahma would request Priyavrata to accept household life, Priyavrata would
not be out of touch with devotional service. By the blessings of a Vaisnava, everything is possible. This is
described in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu as krpa-siddhi, or perfection attained simply by the blessings of a
superior person. One usually becomes liberated and perfect by executing the regulative principles set
down in the sastras. Nonetheless, many persons have achieved perfection simply by the blessings of a
spiritual master or superior.
Priyavrata was the grandson of Lord Brahma, and as joking competition sometimes takes place between
grandson and grandfather, in this case also Priyavrata was determined to remain in meditation, whereas
Brahma was determined that he rule the universe. Thus Lord Brahma's affectionate smile and glance
meant, "My dear Priyavrata, you have decided not to accept household life, but I have decided to convince
you that you must accept it." Actually, Brahma had come to praise Priyavrata for his high standard of
renunciation, austerity, penance and devotion so that he would not be deviated from devotional service,
even though he would accept household life.
In this verse, one important word is sukta-vakena (by Vedic hymns). In the Vedas, there is the following
prayer to Lord Brahma: hiranyagarbhah samavartatagre bhutasya jatah patir eka asit. Brahma was received
with the appropriate Vedic hymns, and because he was welcomed according to the Vedic etiquette, he was
very pleased.
