yatrottamasloka-gunanuvadah
prastuyate gramya-katha-vighatah
nisevyamano 'nudinam mumuksor
matim satim yacchati vasudeve
SYNONYMS
yatra--in which place (in the presence of exalted devotees); uttama-sloka-guna-anuvadah--discussion of
the pastimes and glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; prastuyate--is presented; gramya-kathavighatah--
due to which there is no chance of talking of worldly matters; nisevyamanah--being heard very
seriously; anudinam--day after day; mumuksoh--of persons who are very serious about getting out of
material entanglement; matim--meditation; satim--pure and simple; yacchati--is turned; vasudeve--unto
the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva.
TRANSLATION
Who are the pure devotees mentioned here? In an assembly of pure devotees, there is no question of
discussing material subjects like politics and sociology. In an assembly of pure devotees, there is
discussion only of the qualities, forms and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is praised
and worshiped with full attention. In the association of pure devotees, by constantly hearing such topics
respectfully, even a person who wants to merge into the existence of the Absolute Truth abandons this
idea and gradually becomes attached to the service of Vasudeva.
PURPORT
The symptoms of pure devotees are described in this verse. The pure devotee is never interested in
material topics. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has strictly prohibited His devotees to talk about worldly
matters. Gramya-varta na kahibe: one should not indulge in talking unnecessarily about news of the
material world. One should not waste time in this way. This is a very important feature in the life of a
devotee. A devotee has no other ambition than to serve Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
Krsna consciousness movement was started to engage people twenty-four hours daily in the service of the
Lord and in His glorification. The students in this institution engage in the cultivation of Krsna
consciousness from five in the morning to ten at night. They actually have no opportunity to waste their
time unnecessarily by discussing politics, sociology and current events. These will go their own way. A
devotee is concerned only with serving Krsna positively and seriously.
