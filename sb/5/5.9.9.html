<h2>Text</h2>
brahmana uvaca
tvayoditam vyaktam avipralabdham
bhartuh sa me syad yadi vira bharah
gantur yadi syad adhigamyam adhva
piveti rasau na vidam pravadah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahmanah uvaca--the learned brahmana (Jada Bharata) spoke; tvaya--by you; uditam--explained;
vyaktam--very clearly; avipralabdham--without contradictions; bhartuh--of the bearer, the body; sah--that;
me--mine; syat--it would have been; yadi--if; vira--O great hero (Maharaja Rahugana); bharah--a load;
gantuh--of the mover, also the body; yadi--if; syat--it had been; adhigamyam--the object to be obtained;
adhva--the path; piva--very stout and strong; iti--thus; rasau--in the body; na--not; vidam--of the selfrealized
persons; pravadah--subject matter for discussion.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great brahmana Jada Bharata said: My dear King and hero, whatever you have spoken sarcastically
is certainly true. Actually these are not simply words of chastisement, for the body is the carrier. The load
carried by the body does not belong to me, for I am the spirit soul. There is no contradiction in your
statements because I am different from the body. I am not the carrier of the palanquin; the body is the
carrier. Certainly, as you have hinted, I have not labored carrying the palanquin, for I am detached from
the body. You have said that I am not stout and strong, and these words are befitting a person who does
not know the distinction between the body and the soul. The body may be fat or thin, but no learned man
would say such things of the spirit soul. As far as the spirit soul is concerned, I am neither fat nor skinny;
therefore you are correct when you say that I am not very stout. Also, if the object of this journey and the
path leading there were mine, there would be many troubles for me, but because they relate not to me but
to my body, there is no trouble at all.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge is not disturbed by the
pains and pleasures of the material body. The material body is completely separate from the spirit soul,
and the pains and pleasures of the body are superfluous. The practice of austerity and penance is meant
for understanding the distinction between the body and the soul and how the soul can be unaffected by
the pleasures and pains of the body. Jada Bharata was actually situated on the platform of self-realization.
He was completely aloof from the bodily conception; therefore he immediately took this position and
convinced the King that whatever contradictory things the King had said about his body did not actually
apply to him as a spirit soul.
