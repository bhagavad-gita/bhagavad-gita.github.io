<h2>Text</h2>
na yatra vaikuntha-katha-sudhapaga
na sadhavo bhagavatas tadasrayah
na yatra yajnesa-makha mahotsavah
suresa-loko 'pi na vai sa sevyatam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; yatra--where; vaikuntha-katha-sudha-apagah--the nectarean rivers of discussions about the
Supreme personality of Godhead, who is called Vaikuntha, or one who drives away all anxiety; na--nor;
sadhavah--devotees; bhagavatah--always engaged in the service of the Lord; tat-asrayah--who are sheltered
by the Supreme personality of Godhead; na--nor; yatra--where; yajna-isa-makhah--the performance of
devotional service to the Lord of sacrifices; maha-utsavah--which are actual festivals; suresa-lokah--a place
inhabited by the denizens of heaven; api--although; na--not; vai--certainly; sah--that; sevyatam--be
frequented.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
An intelligent person does not take interest in a place, even in the topmost planetary system, if the pure
Ganges of topics concerning the Supreme Lord's activities does not flow there, if there are not devotees
engaged in service on the banks of such a river of piety, or if there are no festivals of sankirtana-yajna to
satisfy the Lord [especially since sankirtana-yajna is recommended in this age].
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared in the land of Bharata-varsa, specifically in Bengal, in the district of
Nadia, where Navadvipa is situated. It is therefore to be concluded, as stated by Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura, that within this universe, this earth is the best planet, and on this planet the land of Bharatavarsa
is the best; in the land of Bharatavarsa, Bengal is still better, in Bengal the district of Nadia is still
better, and in Nadia the best place is Navadvipa because Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared there to
inaugurate the performance of the sacrifice of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. The sastras
recommend:
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is always accompanied by His very confidential associates such as Sri
Nityananda, Sri Gadadhara and Sri Advaita and by many devotees like Srivasa. They are always engaged in
chanting the name of the Lord and are always describing Lord Krsna. Therefore this is the best among all
the places in the universe. The Krsna consciousness movement has established its center in Mayapur, the
birthsite of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, to give men the great opportunity to go there and perform a
constant festival of sankirtana-yajna, as recommended herein (yajnesa-makha mahotsavah) and to
distribute prasada to millions of hungry people hankering for spiritual emancipation. This is the mission
of the Krsna consciousness movement. Caitanya-bhagavata confirms this as follows: "One should not
desire to be elevated even to a place in the heavenly planetary systems if it has no propaganda to expand
the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no trace of Vaisnavas, pure devotees of the Lord, and
no festivals for spreading Krsna consciousness. It would be better to live perpetually cramped within the
airtight bag of a mother's womb, where one can at least remember the lotus feet of the Lord, than to live
in a place where there is no opportunity to remember His lotus feet. I pray not to be allowed to take birth
in such a condemned place." Similarly, in Caitanya-caritamrta, Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami says that
since Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the inaugurator of the sankirtana movement, anyone who performs
sankirtana to please the Lord is very, very glorious. Such a person has perfect intelligence, whereas others
are in the ignorance of material existence. Of all the sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literatures, the
performance of sankirtana-yajna is the best. Even the performance of one hundred asvamedha sacrifices
cannot compare to the sacrifice of sankirtana. According to the author of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, if one
compares sankirtana-yajna to other yajnas, he is a pasandi, an infidel, and is liable to be punished by
Yamaraja. There are many Mayavadis who think that the performance of sankirtana-yajna is a pious
activity similar to the performance of the asvamedha-yajna and other such pious functions, but this is a
nama-aparadha. Chanting of the holy name of Narayana and chanting of other names are never equal,
despite what Mayavadis think.
