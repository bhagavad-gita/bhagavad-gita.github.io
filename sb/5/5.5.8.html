<h2>Text</h2>
pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam
tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho 'yam aham mameti
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pumsah--of a male; striyah--of a female; mithuni-bhavam--attraction for sexual life; etam--this; tayoh--of
both of them; mithah--between one another; hrdaya-granthim--the knot of the hearts; ahuh--they call;
atah--thereafter; grha--by home; ksetra--field; suta--children; apta--relatives; vittaih--and by wealth;
janasya--of the living being; mohah--illusion; ayam--this; aham--I; mama--mine; iti--thus.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this
misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body,
home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in
terms of "I and mine."
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sex serves as the natural attraction between man and woman, and when they are married, their
relationship becomes more involved. Due to the entangling relationship between man and woman, there
is a sense of illusion whereby one thinks, "This man is my husband," or "This woman is my wife." This is
called hrdaya-granthi, "the hard knot in the heart." This knot is very difficult to undo, even though a man
and woman separate either for the principles of varnasrama or simply to get a divorce. In any case, the
man always thinks of the woman, and the woman always thinks of the man. Thus a person becomes
materially attached to family, property and children, although all of these are temporary. The possessor
unfortunately identifies with his property and wealth. Sometimes, even after renunciation, one becomes
attached to a temple or to the few things that constitute the property of a sannyasi, but such attachment is
not as strong as family attachment. The attachment to the family is the strongest illusion. In the Satyasamhita,
it is stated:
brahmadya yajnavalkadya
mucyante stri-sahayinah
bodhyante kecanaitesam
visesam ca vido viduh
Sometimes it is found among exalted personalities like Lord Brahma that the wife and children are not a
cause of bondage. On the contrary, the wife actually helps further spiritual life and liberation.
Nonetheless, most people are bound by the knots of the marital relationship, and consequently they forget
their relationship with Krsna.
