<h2>Text</h2>
tatrapi bharatam eva varsam karma-ksetram anyany asta varsani svarginam punya-sesopabhoga-sthanani
bhaumani svarga-padani vyapadisanti.
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra api--out of all of them; bharatam--known as Bharata-varsa; eva--certainly; varsam--the tract of land;
karma-ksetram--the field of activities; anyani--the others; asta varsani--eight tracts of land; svarginam--of
the living entities elevated to the heavenly planets by extraordinary pious activities; punya--of the results
of pious activities; sesa--of the remainder; upabhoga-sthanani--the places for material enjoyment;
bhaumani svarga-padani--as the heavenly places on earth; vyapadisanti--they designate.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Among the nine varsas, the tract of land known as Bharata-varsa is understood to be the field of fruitive
activities. Learned scholars and saintly persons declare the other eight varsas to be meant for very highly
elevated pious persons. After returning from the heavenly planets, they enjoy the remaining results of
their pious activities in these eight earthly varsas.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The heavenly places of enjoyment are divided into three groups: the celestial heavenly planets, the
heavenly places on earth, and the bila heavenly places, which are found in the lower regions. Among these
three classes of heavenly places (bhauma-svarga-pada-ni), the heavenly places on earth are the eight
varsas other than Bharata-varsa. In Bhagavad-gita (9.21) Krsna says, ksine punye martya-lokam visanti:
when the persons living in the heavenly planets exhaust the results of their pious activities, they return to
this earth. In this way, they are elevated to the heavenly planets, and then they again fall to the earthly
planets. This process is known as brahmanda bhramana, wandering up and down throughout the
universes. Those who are intelligent--in other words, those who have not lost their intelligence--do not
involve themselves in this process of wandering up and down. They take to the devotional service of the
Lord so that they can ultimately penetrate the covering of this universe and enter the spiritual kingdom.
Then they are situated on one of the planets known as Vaikunthaloka or, still higher. Krsnaloka (Goloka
Vrndavana). A devotee is never caught in the process of being promoted to the heavenly planets and again
coming down. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says:
ei rupe brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
Among all the living entities wandering throughout the universe, one who is most fortunate comes in
contact with a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets the opportunity to
execute devotional service. Those who are sincerely seeking the favor of Krsna come in contact with a
guru, a bona fide representative of Krsna. The Mayavadis indulging in mental speculation and the karmis
desiring the results of their actions cannot become gurus. A guru must be a direct representative of Krsna
who distributes the instructions of Krsna without any change. Thus only the most fortunate persons come
in contact with the guru. As confirmed in the Vedic literatures, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet:
one has to search out a guru to understand the affairs of the spiritual world. Srimad-Bhagavatam also
confirms this point. Tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam: one who is very interested in
understanding the activities in the spiritual world must search out a guru--a bona fide representative of
Krsna. From all angles of vision, therefore, the word guru is especially meant for the bona fide
representative of Krsna and no one else. Padma Purana states, avaisnavo gurur na syat: one who is not a
Vaisnava, or who is not a representative of Krsna, cannot be a guru. Even the most qualified brahmana
cannot become a guru if he is not a representative of Krsna. Brahmanas are supposed to acquire six kinds
of auspicious qualifications: they become very learned scholars (pathana) and very qualified teachers
(pathana); they become expert in worshiping the Lord or the demigods (yajana), and they teach others
how to execute this worship (yajana); they qualify themselves as bona fide persons to receive alms from
others (pratigraha), and they distribute the wealth in charity (dana). Yet even a brahmana possessing
these qualifications cannot become a guru unless he is the representative of Krsna (gurur na syat).
Vaisnavah sva-paco guruh: but a Vaisnava, a bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Visnu, can become a guru, even if he is sva-paca, a member of a family of dog-eaters. Of the
three divisions of heavenly planets (svarga-loka), bhauma-svarga is sometimes accepted as the tract of
land in Bharata-varsa known as Kashmir. In this region there are certainly good facilities for material
sense enjoyment, but this is not the business of a pure transcendentalist. Rupa Gosvami describes the
engagement of a pure transcendentalist as follows:
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." Those who fully engage in devotional service to Krsna just to please Him are not
interested in the three divisions of heavenly places, namely, divya-svarga, bhauma-svarga and bila-svarga.
