TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: O great sages, I am certainly very pleased with your
prayers. You are all truthful. You have prayed for the benediction of a son like Me for King Nabhi, but this
is very difficult to obtain. Since I am the Supreme Person without a second and since no one is equal to
Me, another personality like Me is not possible to find. In any case, because you are all qualified
brahmanas, your vibrations should not prove untrue. I consider the brahmanas who are well qualified
with brahminical qualities to be as good as My own mouth.
PURPORT
The word avitatha-girbhih means "they whose spoken vibrations cannot be nullified." The brahmanas
(dvija, the twice-born), are given a chance by the sastric regulations to become almost as powerful as the
Supreme Lord. Whatever a brahmana speaks cannot be nullified or changed in any circumstance.
According to the Vedic injunctions, a brahmana is the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
therefore in all rituals a brahmana is offered food (brahmana-bhojana) because when a brahmana eats, it
is considered that the Supreme Lord Himself eats. Similarly, whatever a brahmana speaks cannot be
changed. It must act. The learned sages who were priests at Maharaja Nabhi's sacrifice were not only
brahmanas but were so qualified that they were like devas, demigods, or God Himself. If this were not the
case, how could they invite Lord Visnu to come to the sacrificial arena? God is one, and God does not
belong to this or that religion. In Kali-yuga, different religious sects consider their God to be different
from the God of others, but that is not possible. God is one, and He is appreciated according to different
angles of vision. In this verse the word kaivalyat means that God has no competitor. There is only one
God. In the Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.8) it is said, na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate: "No one is found
to be equal to Him or greater than Him." That is the definition of God.
