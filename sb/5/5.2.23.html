Chapter Three
Rsabhadeva's Appearance in the Womb of Merudevi, the Wife of King Nabhi
Rsabhadeva' s Appearance in the Womb of Merudevi, the Wife of King Nabhi
In this chapter the spotless character of King Nabhi, the oldest son of Agnidhra, is described. Wanting
to have sons, Maharaja Nabhi underwent severe austerities and penances. He performed many sacrifices
along with his wife and worshiped Lord Visnu, master of all sacrifices. Being very kind to His devotees,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead was very pleased with the austerities of Maharaja Nabhi. He
personally appeared before the King in His four-handed feature, and the priests, who were performing the
sacrifices, began to offer their prayers unto Him. They prayed for a son like the Lord, and Lord Visnu
agreed to take birth in the womb of Merudevi, the wife of King Nabhi, and incarnate as King Rsabhadeva.
