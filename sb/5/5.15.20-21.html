<h2>Translation</h2>
The mud on both banks of the River Jambu-nadi, being moistened by the flowing juice and then dried
by the air and the sunshine, produces huge quantities of gold called Jambu-nada. The denizens of heaven
use this gold for various kinds of ornaments. Therefore all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and
their youthful wives are fully decorated with golden helmets, bangles and belts, and thus they enjoy life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the rivers on some planets produce gold on
their banks. The poor inhabitants of this earth, because of their incomplete knowledge, are captivated by a
so-called bhagavan who can produce a small quantity of gold. However, it is understood that in a higher
planetary system in this material world, the mud on the banks of the Jambu-nadi mixes with jambu juice,
reacts with the sunshine in the air, and automatically produces huge quantities of gold. Thus the men and
women are decorated there by various golden ornaments, and they look very nice. Unfortunately, on earth
there is such a scarcity of gold that the governments of the world try to keep it in reserve and issue paper
currency. Because that currency is not backed up by gold, the paper they distribute as money is worthless,
but nevertheless the people on earth are very proud of material advancement. In modern times, girls and
ladies have ornaments made of plastic instead of gold, and plastic utensils are used instead of golden ones,
yet people are very proud of their material wealth. Therefore the people of this age are described as
mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (Bhag. 1.1.10). In other words, they are extremely
bad and slow to understand the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They have been
described as sumanda-matayah because their conceptions are so crippled that they accept a bluffer who
produces a little gold to be God. Because they have no gold in their possession, they are actually povertystricken,
and therefore they are considered unfortunate.
Sometimes these unfortunate people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets to achieve fortunate
positions, as described in this verse, but pure devotees of the Lord are not at all interested in such
opulence. Indeed, devotees sometimes compare the color of gold to that of bright golden stool. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed devotees not to be allured by golden ornaments and beautifully
decorated women. Na dhanam na janam na sundarim: a devotee should not be allured by gold. beautiful
women or the prestige of having many followers. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, therefore, confidentially
prayed, mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: "My Lord, please bless Me with
Your devotional service. I do not want anything else." A devotee may pray to be delivered from this
material world. That is his only aspiration.
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
The humble devotee simply prays to the Lord, "Kindly pick me up from the material world, which is full
of varieties of material opulence, and keep me under the shelter of Your lotus feet."
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura prays:
ha ha prabhu nanda-suta, vrsabhanu-suta-yuta,
karuna karaha ei-bara
narottama-dasa kaya, na theliha ranga-paya,
toma vine ke ache amara
"O my Lord, O son of Nanda Maharaja, now You are standing before me with Your consort, the
daughter of Vrsabhanu, Srimati Radharani. Kindly accept me as the dust of Your lotus feet. please do not
kick me away, for I have no other shelter."
Similarly, Prabodhananda Sarasvati indicates that the position of the demigods, who are decorated with
golden helmets and other ornaments, is no better than a phantasmagoria (tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate).
A devotee is never allured by such opulences. He simply aspires to become the dust of the lotus feet of the
Lord.
