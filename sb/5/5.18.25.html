<h2>Text</h2>
prapta nr-jatim tv iha ye ca jantavo
jnana-kriya-dravya-kalapa-sambhrtam
na vai yaterann apunar-bhavaya te
bhuyo vanauka iva yanti bandhanam
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
praptah--who have obtained; nr-jatim--a birth in human society; tu--certainly; iha--in this land of
Bharata-varsa; ye--those who; ca--also; jantavah--the living beings; jnana--with knowledge; kriya--with
activities; dravya--of ingredients; kalapa--with a collection; sambhrtam--full; na--not; vai--certainly;
yateran--endeavor; apunah-bhavaya--for the position of immortality; te--such persons; bhuyah--again;
vanaukah--birds; iva--like; yanti--go; bandhanam--to bondage.
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bharata-varsa offers the proper land and circumstances in which to execute devotional service, which
can free one from the results of jnana and karma. If one obtains a human body in the land of Bharatavarsa,
with clear sensory organs with which to execute the sankirtana-yajna, but in spite of this
opportunity he does not take to devotional service, he is certainly like liberated forest animals and birds
that are careless and are therefore again bound by a hunter.
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the land of Bharata-varsa one can very easily perform the sankirtana-yajna, which consists of
sravanam kirtanam visnoh, or one can perform other methods of devotional service, such as smaranam
vandanam arcanam dasyam sakhyam and atma-nivedanam. In Bharata-varsa one has the opportunity to
visit many holy places, especially Lord Caitanya's birthsite and Lord Krsna's birthsite--Navadvipa and
Vrndavana--where there are many pure devotees who have no desire other than to execute devotional
service (anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam), and one may thus become free from the
bondage of material conditions. Other paths, such as the path of jnana and the path of karma, are not very
profitable. Pious activities can elevate one to the higher planetary systems, and by speculative knowledge
one can merge into the Brahman existence, but that is not real profit, for one has to come down again
even from the liberated condition of being merged in Brahman, and certainly one must come down from
the heavenly kingdom. One should endeavor to go back home, back to Godhead (yanti mad-yajino 'pi
mam). Otherwise there is no difference between human life and the lives of jungle animals and birds.
Animals and birds also have freedom, but because of their lower birth, they cannot use it. Taking
advantage of all the facilities offered him, a human being who has taken birth in the land of Bharata-varsa
should become a fully enlightened devotee and go back home, back to Godhead. This is the subject matter
of the Krsna consciousness movement. The inhabitants of places other than Bharata-varsa have facilities
for material enjoyment, but they do not have the same facility to take to Krsna consciousness. Therefore
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has advised that one who has taken birth as a human being in Bharata-varsa
must first realize himself as a part and parcel of Krsna, and after taking to Krsna consciousness, he must
distribute this knowledge all over the world.
