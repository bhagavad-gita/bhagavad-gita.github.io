sama-sila bhajanti vai
pitr-bhuta-prajesadin
sriyaisvarya-prajepsavah
SYNONYMS
rajah--the mode of passion; tamah--the mode of ignorance; prakrtayah--of that mentality; sama-silah--of
the same categories; bhajanti--do worship; vai--actually; pitr--the forefathers; bhuta--other living beings;
prajesa-adin--controllers of cosmic administration; sriya--enrichment; aisvarya--wealth and power; praja--
progeny; ipsavah--so desiring.
TRANSLATION
Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance worship the forefathers, other living beings and
the demigods who are in charge of cosmic activities, for they are urged by a desire to be materially
benefited with women, wealth, power and progeny.
PURPORT
There is no need to worship demigods of whatsoever category if one is serious about going back to
Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gita (7.20,23) it is clearly said that those who are mad after material enjoyment
approach the different demigods for temporary benefits, which are meant for men with a poor fund of
knowledge. We should never desire to increase the depth of material enjoyment. Material enjoyment
should be accepted only up to the point of the bare necessities of life and not more or less than that. To
accept more material enjoyment means to bind oneself more and more to the miseries of material
existence. More wealth, more women and false aristocracy are some of the demands of the materially
disposed man because he has no information of the benefit derived from Visnu worship. By Visnu
worship one can derive benefit in this life as well as in life after death. Forgetting these principles, foolish
people who are after more wealth, more wives and more children worship various demigods. The aim of
life is to end the miseries of life and not to increase them.
For material enjoyment there is no need to approach the demigods. The demigods are but servants of
the Lord. As such, they are duty-bound to supply necessities of life in the form of water, light, air, etc.
One should work hard and worship the Supreme Lord by the fruits of one's hard labor for existence, and
that should be the motto of life. One should be careful to execute occupational service with faith in God
in the proper way, and that will lead one gradually on the progressive march back to Godhead.
Lord Sri Krsna, when He was personally present at Vrajadhama, stopped the worship of the demigod
Indra and advised the residents of Vraja to worship by their business and to have faith in God.
Worshiping the multidemigods for material gain is practically a perversity of religion. This sort of
religious activity has been condemned in the very beginning of the Bhagavatam as kaitava-dharma. There
is only one religion in the world to be followed by one and all, and that is the Bhagavata-dharma, or the
religion which teaches one to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead and no one else.

TRANSLATION
In the revealed scriptures, the ultimate object of knowledge is Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead.
The purpose of performing sacrifice is to please Him. Yoga is for realizing Him. All fruitive activities are
ultimately rewarded by Him only. He is supreme knowledge, and all severe austerities are performed to
know Him. Religion [dharma] is rendering loving service unto Him. He is the supreme goal of life.
PURPORT
That Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, is the only object of worship is confirmed in these two
slokas. In the Vedic literature there is the same objective: establishing one's relationship and ultimately
reviving our lost loving service unto Him. That is the sum and substance of the Vedas. In the Bhagavadgita
the same theory is confirmed by the Lord in His own words: the ultimate purpose of the Vedas is to
know Him only. All the revealed scriptures are prepared by the Lord through His incarnation in the body
of Srila Vyasadeva just to remind the fallen souls, conditioned by material nature, of Sri Krsna, the
Personality of Godhead. No demigod can award freedom from material bondage. That is the verdict of all
the Vedic literatures. Impersonalists who have no information of the Personality of Godhead minimize the
omnipotency of the Supreme Lord and put Him on equal footing with all other living beings, and for this
act such impersonalists get freedom from material bondage only with great difficulty. They can surrender
unto Him only after many, many births in the culture of transcendental knowledge.
One may argue that the Vedic activities are based on sacrificial ceremonies. That is true. But all such
sacrifices are also meant for realizing the truth about Vasudeva. Another name of Vasudeva is Yajna
(sacrifice), and in the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that all sacrifices and all activities are to be
conducted for the satisfaction of Yajna, or Visnu, the Personality of Godhead. This is the case also with
the yoga systems. Yoga means to get into touch with the Supreme Lord. The process, however, includes
several bodily features such as asana, dhyana, pranayama and meditation, and all of them are meant for
concentrating upon the localized aspect of Vasudeva represented as Paramatma. Paramatma realization is
but partial realization of Vasudeva, and if one is successful in that attempt, one realizes Vasudeva in full.
But by ill luck most yogis are stranded by the powers of mysticism achieved through the bodily process.
Ill-fated yogis are given a chance in the next birth by being placed in the families of good learned
brahmanas or in the families of rich merchants in order to execute the unfinished task of Vasudeva
realization. If such fortunate brahmanas and sons of rich men properly utilize the chance, they can easily
realize Vasudeva by good association with saintly persons. Unfortunately, such preferred persons are
captivated again by material wealth and honor, and thus they practically forget the aim of life.
This is also so for the culture of knowledge. According to Bhagavad-gita there are eighteen items in
culturing knowledge. By such culture of knowledge one becomes gradually prideless, devoid of vanity,
nonviolent, forbearing, simple, devoted to the great spiritual master, and self-controlled. By culture of
knowledge one becomes unattached to hearth and home and becomes conscious of the miseries due to
death, birth, old age and disease. And all culture of knowledge culminates in devotional service to the
Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. Therefore, Vasudeva is the ultimate aim in culturing all different
branches of knowledge. Culture of knowledge leading one to the transcendental plane of meeting
Vasudeva is real knowledge. physical knowledge in its various branches is condemned in the Bhagavadgita
as ajnana, or the opposite of real knowledge. The ultimate aim of physical knowledge is to satisfy the
senses, which means prolongation of the term of material existence and thereby continuance of the
threefold miseries. So prolonging the miserable life of material existence is nescience. But the same
physical knowledge leading to the way of spiritual understanding helps one to end the miserable life of
physical existence and to begin the life of spiritual existence on the plane of Vasudeva.
The same applies to all kinds of austerities. Tapasya means voluntary acceptance of bodily pains to
achieve some higher end of life. Ravana and Hiranyakasipu underwent a severe type of bodily torture to
achieve the end of sense gratification. Sometimes modern politicians also undergo severe types of
austerities to achieve some political end. This is not actually tapasya. One should accept voluntary bodily
inconvenience for the sake of knowing Vasudeva because that is the way of real austerities. Otherwise all
forms of austerities are classified as modes of passion and ignorance. passion and ignorance cannot end
the miseries of life. Only the mode of goodness can mitigate the threefold miseries of life. Vasudeva and
Devaki, the so-called father and mother of Lord Krsna, underwent penances to get Vasudeva as their son.
Lord Sri Krsna is the father of all living beings (Bg. 14.4). Therefore He is the original living being of all
other living beings. He is the original eternal enjoyer amongst all other enjoyers. Therefore no one can be
His begetting father, as the ignorant may think. Lord Sri Krsna agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and
Devaki upon being pleased with their severe austerities. Therefore if any austerities have to be done, they
must be done to achieve the end of knowledge, Vasudeva.
Vasudeva is the original Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna. As explained before, the original
Personality of Godhead expands Himself by innumerable forms. Such expansion of forms is made possible
by His various energies. His energies are also multifarious, and His internal energies are superior and
external energies inferior in quality. They are explained in the Bhagavad-gita (7.4-6) as the para and the
apara prakrtis. So His expansions of various forms which take place via the internal energies are superior
forms, whereas the expansions which take place via the external energies are inferior forms. The living
entities are also His expansions. The living entities who are expanded by His internal potency are eternally
liberated persons, whereas those who are expanded in terms of the material energies are eternally
conditioned souls. Therefore, all culture of knowledge, austerities, sacrifice and activities should be aimed
at changing the quality of the influence that is acting upon us. For the present, we are all being controlled
by the external energy of the Lord, and just to change the quality of the influence, we must endeavor to
cultivate spiritual energy. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that those who are mahatmas, or those whose
minds have been so broadened as to be engaged in the service of Lord Krsna, are under the influence of
the internal potency, and the effect is that such broadminded living beings are constantly engaged in the
service of the Lord without deviation. That should be the aim of life. And that is the verdict of all the
Vedic literatures. No one should bother himself with fruitive activities or dry speculation about
transcendental knowledge. Everyone should at once engage himself in the transcendental loving service of
the Lord. Nor should one worship different demigods who work as different hands of the Lord for
creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world. There are innumerable powerful demigods
who look over the external management of the material world. They are all different assisting hands of
Lord Vasudeva. Even Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are included in the list of demigods, but Lord Visnu, or
Vasudeva, is always transcendentally situated. Even though He accepts the quality of goodness of the
material world, He is still transcendental to all the material modes. The following example will clear that
matter more explicitly. In the prison house there are the prisoners and the managers of the prison house.
Both the managers and the prisoners are bound by the laws of the king. But even though the king
sometimes comes in the prison, he is not bound by the laws of the prison house. The king is therefore
always transcendental to the laws of the prison house, as the Lord is always transcendental to the laws of
the material world.
