<h2>Translation</h2>
The pseudo svamis, yogis and incarnations who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead
are known as pasandis. They themselves are fallen and cheated because they do not know the real path of
spiritual advancement, and whoever goes to them is certainly cheated in his turn. When one is thus
cheated, he sometimes takes shelter of the real followers of Vedic principles [brahmanas or those in Krsna
consciousness], who teach everyone how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to
the Vedic rituals. However, being unable to stick to these principles, these rascals again fall down and take
shelter among sudras who are very expert in making arrangements for sex indulgence. Sex is very
prominent among animals like monkeys, and such people who are enlivened by sex may be called
descendants of monkeys.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By fulfilling the process of evolution from the aquatics to the animal platform, a living entity eventually
reaches the human form. The three modes of material nature are always working in the evolutionary
process. Those who come to the human form through the quality of sattva-guna were cows in their last
animal incarnation. Those who come to the human form through the quality of rajo-guna were lions in
their last animal incarnation. And those who come to the human form through the quality of tamo-guna
were monkeys in their last animal incarnation. In this age, those who come through the monkey species
are considered by modern anthropologists like Darwin to be descendants of monkeys. We receive
information herein that those who are simply interested in sex are actually no better than monkeys.
Monkeys are very expert in sexual enjoyment, and sometimes sex glands are taken from monkeys and
placed in the human body so that a human being can enjoy sex in old age. In this way modern civilization
has advanced. Many monkeys in India were caught and sent to Europe so that their sex glands could serve
as replacements for those of old people. Those who actually descend from the monkeys are interested in
expanding their aristocratic families through sex. In the Vedas there are also certain ceremonies especially
meant for sexual improvement and promotion to higher planetary systems, where the demigods are
enjoying sex. The demigods are also very much inclined toward sex because that is the basic principle of
material enjoyment.
First of all, the conditioned soul is cheated by so-called svamis, yogis and incarnations when he
approaches them to be relieved of material miseries. When the conditioned soul is not satisfied with them.
he comes to devotees and pure brahmanas who try to elevate him for final liberation from material
bondage. However, the unscrupulous conditioned soul cannot rigidly follow the principles prohibiting
illicit sex. intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Thus he falls down and takes shelter of people who are
like monkeys. In the Krsna consciousness movement these monkey disciples, being unable to follow the
strict regulative principles, sometimes fall down and try to form societies based on sex. This is proof that
such people are descendants of monkeys, as confirmed by Darwin. In this verse it is therefore clearly
stated: yatha vanara jateh.
