<h2>Text</h2>

<h2>Translation</h2>
A person who accepts his body as his self works very hard day and night for money to maintain his own
body and the bodies of his wife and children. While working to maintain himself and his family, he may
commit violence against other living entities. Such a person is forced to give up his body and his family at
the time of death, when he suffers the reaction for his envy of other creatures by being thrown into the
hell called Raurava.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said:
yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke
sva-dhih kalatradisu bhauma-ijya-dhih
yat-tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij
janesv abhijnesu sa eva go-kharah
"One who accepts this bodily bag of three elements [bile, mucus and air] as his self, who has an affinity
for an intimate relationship with his wife and children, who considers his land worshipable, who takes
bath in the waters of the holy places of pilgrimage but never takes advantage of those persons who are in
actual knowledge--he is no better than an ass or a cow." (Bhag. 10.84.13) There are two classes of men
absorbed in the material concept of life. Out of ignorance, a man in the first class thinks his body to be his
self, and therefore he is certainly like an animal (sa eva go-kharah). The person in the second class,
however, not only thinks his material body to be his self, but also commits all kinds of sinful activities to
maintain his body. He cheats everyone to acquire money for his family and his self, and he becomes
envious of others without reason. Such a person is thrown into the hell known as Raurava. If one simply
considers his body to be his self, as do the animals, he is not very sinful. However, if one needlessly
commits sins to maintain his body, he is put into the hell known as Raurava. This is the opinion of Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. Although animals are certainly in the bodily concept of life, they do not
commit any sins to maintain their bodies, mates or offspring. Therefore animals do not go to hell.
However, when a human being acts enviously and cheats others to maintain his body, he is put into a
hellish condition.
