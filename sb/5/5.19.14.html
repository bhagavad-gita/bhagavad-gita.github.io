TRANSLATION
Materialists are generally very attached to their present bodily comforts and to the bodily comforts they
expect in the future. Therefore they are always absorbed in thoughts of their wives, children and wealth
and are afraid of giving up their bodies, which are full of stool and urine. If a person engaged in Krsna
consciousness, however, is also afraid of giving up his body, what is the use of his having labored to study
the sastras? It was simply a waste of time.
PURPORT
At the time of death a materialist thinks of his wife and children. He is absorbed in thinking of how they
will live and who will take care of them after he leaves. Consequently he is never prepared to give up his
body; rather, he wants to continue to live in his body to serve his society, family, friends and so on.
Therefore by practicing the mystic yoga system one must become detached from bodily relationships. If
despite practicing bhakti-yoga and studying all the Vedic literature, one is afraid of giving up his bad
body, which is the cause of all his suffering, what is the use of his attempts to advance in spiritual life?
The secret of success in practicing yoga is to become free from bodily attachments. Srila Narottama dasa
Thakura says, deha-smrti nahi yara, samsara-bandhana kahan tara: one whose practice has freed him from
the anxieties of bodily needs is no longer in conditional life. Such a person is freed from conditional
bondage. A person in Krsna consciousness must fully discharge his devotional duties without material
attachment. Then his liberation is guaranteed.
