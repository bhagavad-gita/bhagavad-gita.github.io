<h2>Translation</h2>
Alas! How wonderful it is that the foolish materialist does not heed the great danger of impending
death! He knows that death will surely come, yet he is nevertheless callous and neglectful. If his father
dies, he wants to enjoy his father's property, and if his son dies, he wants to enjoy his son's possessions as
well. In either case, he heedlessly tries to enjoy material happiness with the acquired money.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Material happiness means to have good facilities for eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defense.
Within this world, the materialistic person lives only for these four principles of sense gratification, not
caring for the impending danger of death. After his father's death, a son tries to inherit his money and use
it for sense gratification. Similarly, one whose son dies tries to enjoy the possessions of his son. Sometimes
the father of a dead son even enjoys his son's widow. Materialistic persons behave in this way. Thus
Sukadeva Gosvami says, "How wonderful are these pastimes of material happiness transacted by the will
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!" In other words, materialistic persons want to commit all kinds
of sinful activities, but without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no one can do
anything. Why does the Supreme Personality of Godhead permit sinful activities? The Supreme Lord does
not want any living being to act sinfully, and He begs him through his good conscience to refrain from
sin. But when someone insists upon acting sinfully, the Supreme Lord gives him the sanction to act at his
own risk (mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca). No one can do anything without the sanction of the Lord,
but He is so kind that when the conditioned soul persists in doing something, the Lord permits the
individual soul to act at his own risk.
According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, sons always outlive their fathers in other planetary
systems and other lands in this universe, especially on Svargaloka. However, on this planet earth a son
often dies before his father, and the materialistic father is pleased to enjoy the possessions of his son.
Neither the father nor the son can see the reality--that both of them are awaiting death. When death
comes, however, all their plans for material enjoyment are finished.
