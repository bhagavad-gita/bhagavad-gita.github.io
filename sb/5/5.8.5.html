<h2>Translation</h2>
Jada Bharata behaved before his father like a fool, despite his father's adequately instructing him in
Vedic knowledge. He behaved in that way so that his father would know that he was unfit for instruction
and would abandon the attempt to instruct him further. He would behave in a completely opposite way.
Although instructed to wash his hands after evacuating, he would wash them before. Nonetheless, his
father wanted to give him Vedic instructions during the spring and summer. He tried to teach him the
Gayatri mantra along with omkara and vyahrti, but after four months, his father still was not successful in
instructing him.
