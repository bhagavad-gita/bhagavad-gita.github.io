<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer
of all the members of the Pandava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity,
friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a
messenger or servant. This means He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the
Lord's favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not very easily give the opportunity to
render direct service unto Him.
PURPORT
While instructing Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami thought it wise to encourage the King because
the King might be thinking of the glorious position of various royal dynasties. Especially glorious is the
dynasty of Priyavrata, in which the Supreme Lord Rsabhadeva incarnated. Similarly, the family of
Uttanapada Maharaja, the father of Maharaja Dhruva, is also glorious due to King Prthu's taking birth in
it. The dynasty of Maharaja Raghu is glorified because Lord Ramacandra appeared in that family. As far as
the Yadu and Kuru dynasties are concerned, they existed simultaneously, but of the two, the Yadu dynasty
was more glorious due to the appearance of Lord Krsna. Maharaja Pariksit might have been thinking that
the Kuru dynasty was not as fortunate as the others because the Supreme Lord did not appear in that
family, neither as Krsna, Lord Ramacandra, Lord Rsabhadeva or Maharaja Prthu. Therefore Pariksit
Maharaja was encouraged by Sukadeva Gosvami in this particular verse.
The Kuru dynasty may be considered more glorious due to the presence of devotees like the five
Pandavas, who rendered unalloyed devotional service. Although Lord Krsna did not appear in the Kuru
dynasty. He was so obligated to the Pandavas' devotional service that He acted as a maintainer of the
family and spiritual master of the Pandavas. Although He took birth in the Yadu dynasty, Lord Krsna was
more affectionate to the Pandavas. By His actions, Lord Krsna proved that He was more inclined to the
Kuru dynasty than the Yadu dynasty. Indeed. Lord Krsna. indebted to the Pandavas' devotional service,
sometimes acted as their messenger, and He guided them through many dangerous situations. Therefore
Maharaja Pariksit should not have been saddened because Lord Krsna did not appear in his family. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is always inclined toward His pure devotees. and by His action it is clear
that liberation is not very important for the devotees. Lord Krsna easily gives one liberation, but He does
not so easily give one the facility to become a devotee. Muktim dadati karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam.
Directly or indirectly, it is proved that bhakti-yoga is the basis for the supreme relationship with the
Supreme Lord. It is far superior to liberation. For a pure devotee of the Lord. mukti is automatically
attained.
