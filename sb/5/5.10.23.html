yad ihamano vijahaty aghaugham
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sasta--the governor; abhigopta--a well-wisher of the citizens as a father is the well-wisher of his children;
nr-patih--the king; prajanam--of the citizens; yah--one who; kinkarah--order carrier; vai--indeed; na--not;
pinasti pistam--grinds what is already ground; sva-dharmam--one's own occupational duty; aradhanam--
worshiping; acyutasya--of the Supreme personality of Godhead; yat--which; ihamanah--performing;
vijahati--they are released from; agha-ogham--all kinds of sinful activity and faulty action.
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear sir, you have said that the relationship between the king and the subject or between the master
and the servant are not eternal, but although such relationships are temporary, when a person takes the
position of a king, his duty is to rule the citizens and punish those who are disobedient to the laws. By
punishing them, he teaches the citizens to obey the laws of the state. Again, you have said that punishing
a person who is deaf and dumb is like chewing the chewed or grinding the pulp; that is to say, there is no
benefit in it. However, if one is engaged in his own occupational duty as ordered by the Supreme Lord, his
sinful activities are certainly diminished. Therefore if one is engaged in his occupational duty by force, he
benefits because he can vanquish all his sinful activities in that way.
PURPORT
This argument offered by Maharaja Rahugana is certainly very effective. In his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
(1.2.4), Srila Rupa Gosvami says, tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet: somehow or other, one
should engage in Krsna consciousness. Actually every living being is an eternal servant of Krsna, but due
to forgetfulness, a living entity engages himself as an eternal servant of maya. As long as one is engaged in
maya's service, he cannot be happy. Our Krsna consciousness movement aims at engaging people in Lord
Krsna's service. That will help them become freed from all material contamination and sinful activity. This
is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.10): vita-raga-bhaya-krodhah. By becoming detached from material
activities, we will be freed from fear and anger. By austerity, one becomes purified and eligible to return
home, back to Godhead. The duty of the king is to rule his citizens in such a way that they can become
Krsna conscious. This would be very beneficial for everyone. Unfortunately the king or president engages
people in sense gratification instead of the Lord's service, and such activities are certainly not beneficial
for anyone. King Rahugana tried to engage Jada Bharata in carrying the palanquin, which is a form of
sense gratification for the King. However, if one is engaged as a palanquin carrier in the Lord's service,
that is certainly beneficial. In this godless civilization, if a president engages people somehow or other in
devotional service or the awakening of Krsna consciousness, he renders the very best service to the
citizens.
