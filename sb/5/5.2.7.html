<h2>Translation</h2>
The Prince mistakenly addressed the Apsara: O best of saintly persons, who are you? Why are you on
this hill, and what do you want to do? Are you one of the illusory potencies of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead? You seem to be carrying two bows without strings, What is the reason you carry these bows? Is
it for some purpose of your own or for the sake of a friend? Perhaps you carry them to kill the mad
animals in this forest.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
While undergoing severe penances in the forest, Agnidhra was captivated by the movements of
Purvacitti, the girl sent by Lord Brahma. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah: when
one becomes lusty, he loses his intelligence. Therefore Agnidhra, having lost his intelligence, could not
distinguish whether Purvacitti was male or female. He mistook her for a muni-putra, the son of a saintly
person in the forest, and addressed her as muni-varya. Because of her personal beauty, however, he could
not believe her to be a boy. He therefore began studying her features. First he saw her two eyebrows,
which were so expressive that he wondered whether he or she might be the maya of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The words used in this connection are bhagavat-para-devatayah. Devatah, the
demigods, all belong to this material world, whereas Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, is always beyond this material world and is therefore known as para-devata. The material world is
certainly created by maya, but it is created under the direction of para-devata, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram), maya is not the
ultimate authority for the creation of this material world. Maya acts on behalf of Krsna.
Purvacitti's eyebrows were so beautiful that Agnidhra compared them to bows without strings. He
therefore asked her whether they were to be used for her own purposes or for the sake of someone else.
Her eyebrows were like bows meant to kill animals in the forest. This material world is like a great forest,
and its inhabitants are like forest animals such as deer and tigers meant to be killed. The killers are the
eyebrows of beautiful women. Captivated by the beauty of the fair sex, all the men of the world are killed
by bows without strings, but cannot see how they are killed by maya. It is a fact, however, that they are
being killed (bhutva bhutva praliyate). By dint of his tapasya, Agnidhra could understand how maya acts
under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The word pramattan is also significant. pramatta refers to one who cannot control his senses. The entire
material world is being exploited by people who are pramatta, or vimudha. Prahlada Maharaja therefore
said:
soce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyarthamaya-
sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan
"They are rotting in material activities for transient material pleasure and spoiling their lives toiling all
day and night simply for sense gratification, with no attachment for love of Godhead. I am simply
lamenting for them and devising various plans to deliver them from the clutches of maya." (Bhag. 7.9.43)
Karmis who act very seriously for sense gratification are always referred to in the sastras by such terms as
pramatta, vimukha and vimudha. They are killed by maya. However, one who is apramatta, a sane, sober
person, a dhira, knows very well that a human being's primary duty is to render service to the Supreme
Person. Maya is always ready to kill those who are pramatta with her invisible bows and arrows. Agnidhra
questioned Purvacitti about this.
