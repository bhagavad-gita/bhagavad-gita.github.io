TRANSLATION
And yet others say that You appeared to rejuvenate the devotional service of hearing, remembering,
worshiping and so on in order that the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take
advantage and gain liberation.
PURPORT
In the Srimad Bhagavad-gita the Lord asserts that He appears in every millennium just to reestablish the
way of religion. The way of religion is made by the Supreme Lord. No one can manufacture a new path of
religion, as is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as
the supreme authority and thus render service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help
but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The only function of the living
being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord is great, and living beings are subordinate to Him.
Therefore, the duty of the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned living
beings, out of misunderstanding only, become servants of the senses by material desire. This desire is
called avidya, or nescience. And out of such desire the living being makes different plans for material
enjoyment centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the chain of birth and
death by transmigrating into different bodies on different planets under the direction of the Supreme
Lord. Unless, therefore, one is beyond the boundary of this nescience, one cannot get free from the
threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature.
The Lord, however, out of His causeless mercy, because He is more merciful to the suffering living
beings than they can expect, appears before them and renovates the principles of devotional service
comprised of hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, cooperating and
surrendering unto Him. Adoption of all the above-mentioned items, or any one of them, can help a
conditioned soul get out of the tangle of nescience and thus become liberated from all material sufferings
created by the living being illusioned by the external energy. This particular type of mercy is bestowed
upon the living being by the Lord in the form of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
