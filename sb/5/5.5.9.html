<h2>Translation</h2>
O My sons, you should accept a highly elevated paramahamsa, a spiritually advanced spiritual master.
In this way, you should place your faith and love in Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You should
detest sense gratification and tolerate the duality of pleasure and pain, which are like the seasonal changes
of summer and winter. Try to realize the miserable condition of living entities, who are miserable even in
the higher planetary systems. Philosophically inquire about the truth. Then undergo all kinds of
austerities and penances for the sake of devotional service. Give up the endeavor for sense enjoyment and
engage in the service of the Lord. Listen to discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
always associate with devotees. Chant about and glorify the Supreme Lord, and look upon everyone
equally on the spiritual platform. Give up enmity and subdue anger and lamentation. Abandon identifying
the self with the body and the home, and practice reading the revealed scriptures. Live in a secluded place
and practice the process by which you can completely control your life air, mind and senses. Have full
faith in the revealed scriptures, the Vedic literatures, and always observe celibacy. Perform your
prescribed duties and avoid unnecessary talks. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
acquire knowledge from the right source. Thus practicing bhakti-yoga, you will patiently and
enthusiastically be elevated in knowledge and will be able to give up the false ego.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In these four verses, Rsabhadeva tells His sons how they can be freed from the false identification arising
from false ego and material conditional life. One gradually becomes liberated by practicing as mentioned
above. All these prescribed methods enable one to give up the material body (lingam vyapohet) and be
situated in his original spiritual body. First of all one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master. This is
advocated by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu: sri-guru-padasrayah. To be freed from
the entanglement of the material world, one has to approach a spiritual master. Tad-vijnanartham sa
gurum evabhigacchet. By questioning the spiritual master and by serving him, one can advance in
spiritual life. When one engages in devotional service, naturally the attraction for personal comfort--for
eating, sleeping and dressing--is reduced. By associating with the devotee, a spiritual standard is
maintained. The word mad-deva-sangat is very important. There are many so-called religions devoted to
the worship of various demigods, but here good association means association with one who simply
accepts Krsna as his worshipable Deity.
Another important item is dvandva-titiksa. As long as one is situated in the material world, there must
be pleasure and pain arising from the material body. As Krsna advises in Bhagavad-gita, tams titiksasva
bharata. One has to learn how to tolerate the temporary pains and pleasures of this material world. One
must also be detached from his family and practice celibacy. Sex with one's wife according to the
scriptural injunctions is also accepted as brahmacarya (celibacy), but illicit sex is opposed to religious
principles, and it hampers advancement in spiritual consciousness. Another important word is vijnanavirajita.
Everything should be done very scientifically and consciously. One should be a realized soul. In
this way, one can give up the entanglement of material bondage.
As Sri Madhvacarya points out, the sum and substance of these four slokas is that one should refrain
from acting out of a desire for sense gratification and should instead always engage in the Lord's loving
service. In other words, bhakti-yoga is the acknowledged path of liberation. Srila Madhvacarya quotes
from the Adhyatma:
atmano 'vihitam karma
varjayitvanya-karmanah
kamasya ca parityago
nirihety ahur uttamah
One should perform activities only for the benefit of the soul; any other activity should be given up.
When a person is situated in this way, he is said to be desireless. Actually a living entity cannot be totally
desireless, but when he desires the benefit of the soul and nothing else, he is said to be desireless.
Spiritual knowledge is jnana-vijnana-samanvitam. When one is fully equipped with jnana and vijnana,
he is perfect. Jnana means that one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, to be the
Supreme Being. Vijnana refers to the activities that liberate one from the ignorance of material existence.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.9.31): jnanam parama-guhyam me yad vijnana-samanvitam.
Knowledge of the Supreme Lord is very confidential, and the supreme knowledge by which one
understands Him furthers the liberation of all living entities. This knowledge is vijnana. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
