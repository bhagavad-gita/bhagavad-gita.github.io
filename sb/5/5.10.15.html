<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: O best of the Pandu dynasty [Maharaja Pariksit], the King of the Sindhu
and Sauvira states [Maharaja Rahugana] had great faith in discussions of the Absolute Truth. Being thus
qualified, he heard from Jada Bharata that philosophical presentation which is approved by all scriptures
on the mystic yoga process and which slackens the knot in the heart. His material conception of himself
as a king was thus destroyed. He immediately descended from his palanquin and fell flat on the ground
with his head at the lotus feet of Jada Bharata in such a way that he might be excused for his insulting
words against the great brahmana. He then prayed as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (4.2) Lord Krsna says:
evam parampara-praptam
imam rajarsayo viduh
sa kaleneha mahata
yogo nastah parantapa
"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings
understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it
is appears to be lost."
Through the disciplic succession the royal order was on the same platform as great saintly persons (rajarsis).
Formerly they could understand the philosophy of life and knew how to train the citizens to come
to the same standard. In other words, they knew how to deliver the citizens from the entanglement of
birth and death. When Maharaja Dasaratha ruled Ayodhya, the great sage Visvamitra once came to him to
take away Lord Ramacandra and Laksmana to the forest to kill a demon. When the saintly person
Visvamitra came to the court of Maharaja Dasaratha, the King, in order to receive the saintly person,
asked him, aihistam yat tat punar janma jayaya. He asked the sage whether everything was going on well
in his endeavor to conquer the repetition of birth and death. The whole process of Vedic civilization is
based on this point. We must know how to conquer the repetition of birth and death. Maharaja Rahugana
also knew the purpose of life; therefore when Jada Bharata put the philosophy of life before him, he
immediately appreciated it. This is the foundation of Vedic society. Learned scholars, brahmanas, saintly
persons and sages who were fully aware of the Vedic purpose advised the royal order how to benefit the
general masses, and by their cooperation, the general masses were benefited. Therefore everything was
successful. Maharaja Rahugana attained this perfection of understanding the value of human life;
therefore he regretted his insulting words to Jada Bharata, and he immediately descended from his
palanquin and fell down at the lotus feet of Jada Bharata in order to be excused and to hear from him
further about the values of life known as brahma jijnasa (inquiry into the Absolute Truth). At the present
moment, high government officials are ignorant of the values of life, and when saintly persons endeavor
to broadcast the Vedic knowledge, the so-called executives do not offer their respectful obeisances but try
to obstruct the spiritual propaganda. Thus one can say that the former kingly government was like heaven
and that the present government is like hell.
