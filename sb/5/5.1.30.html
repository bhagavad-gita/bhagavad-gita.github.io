<h2>Translation</h2>
While so excellently ruling the universe, King Priyavrata once became dissatisfied with the
circumambulation of the most powerful sun-god. Encircling Sumeru Hill on his chariot, the sun-god
illuminates all the surrounding planetary systems. However, when the sun is on the northern side of the
hill, the south receives less light, and when the sun is in the south, the north receives less. King Priyavrata
disliked this situation and therefore decided to make daylight in the part of the universe where there was
night. He followed the orbit of the sun-god on a brilliant chariot and thus fulfilled his desire. He could
perform such wonderful activities because of the power he had achieved by worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a Bengali saying which describes that someone is so powerful that he can make the night day
and the day night. That saying is current because of the prowess of Priyavrata. His activities demonstrate
how powerful he became by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Krsna is known as
Yogesvara, the master of all mystic powers. In Bhagavad-gita (18.78) it is said wherever there is the master
of all mystic powers (yatra yogesvarah krsnah), victory, fortune and all other opulences are present.
Devotional service is so powerful. When a devotee achieves what he wants to accomplish, it is not by his
own mystic power but by the grace of the master of mystic power. Lord Krsna: by His grace, a devotee can
accomplish wonderful things unimaginable even to the most powerful scientist.
From the description in this verse, it appears that the sun moves. According to modern astronomers, the
sun is fixed in one place, surrounded by the solar system, but here we find that the sun is not stationary: it
is rotating in a prescribed orbit. This fact is corroborated by Brahma-samhita (5.52). Yasyajnaya bhramati
sambhrta-kala-cakrah: the sun is rotating in its fixed orbit in accordance with the order of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. According to Jyotir Veda, the science of astronomy in the Vedic literature, the
sun moves for six months on the northern side of the Sumeru Hill and for six months on the southern
side. We have practical experience on this planet that when there is summer in the north there is winter
in the south and vice versa. Modern materialistic scientists sometimes present themselves as knowing all
the ingredients of the sun, yet they are unable to offer a second sun like Maharaja Priyavrata's.
Although Maharaja Priyavrata devised a very powerful chariot as brilliant as the sun, he had no desire to
compete with the sun-god, for a Vaisnava never wants to supersede another Vaisnava. His purpose was to
give abundant benefits in material existence. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that in the
months of April and May the rays of Maharaja Priyavrata's brilliant sun were as pleasing as the rays of the
moon, and in October and November, both morning and evening, that sun provided more warmth than
the sunshine. In short, Maharaja Priyavrata was extremely powerful, and his actions extended his power
in all directions.
