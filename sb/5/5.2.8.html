<h2>Translation</h2>
Then Agnidhra observed the glancing eyes of Purvacitti and said: My dear friend, you have two very
powerful arrows, namely your glancing eyes. Those arrows have feathers like the petals of a lotus flower.
Although they have no shafts, they are very beautiful, and they have very sharp, piercing points. They
appear very peaceful, and thus it seems that they will not be shot at anyone. You must be loitering in this
forest to shoot those arrows at someone, but I cannot understand whom. My intelligence is dull, and I
cannot combat you. Indeed, no one can equal you in prowess, and therefore I pray that your prowess will
be for my good fortune.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Agnidhra thus began appreciating Purvacitti's powerful glance upon him. He compared her glancing
eyes to very sharp arrows. Although her eyes were as beautiful as lotuses, they were simultaneously like
shaftless arrows, and Agnidhra was therefore afraid of them. He hoped that her glances upon him would
be favorable because he was already captivated, and the more captivated he became, the more impossible
it would be for him to remain without her. Agnidhra therefore prayed to Purvacitti that her glances at him
would be auspicious, not futile. In other words, he prayed that she would become his wife.
