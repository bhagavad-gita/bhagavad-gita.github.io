<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
nunam hy aryah sadhava upasama-silah krpana-suhrda evam-vidharthe svarthan api gurutaran upeksante.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nunam--indeed; hi--certainly; aryah--those who are advanced in civilization; sadhavah--saintly persons;
upasama-silah--even though completely in the renounced order of life; krpana-suhrdah--the friends of the
helpless; evam-vidha-arthe--to execute such principles; sva-arthan api--even their own personal interests;
guru-taran--very important; upeksante--neglect.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even though one is in the renounced order, one who is advanced certainly feels compassion for
suffering living entities. One should certainly neglect his own personal interests, although they may be
very important, to protect one who has surrendered.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maya is very strong. In the name of philanthropy, altruism and communism, people are feeling
compassion for suffering humanity throughout the world. Philanthropists and altruists do not realize that
it is impossible to improve people's material conditions. Material conditions are already established by the
superior administration according to one's karma. They cannot be changed. The only benefit we can
render to suffering beings is to try to raise them to spiritual consciousness. Material comforts cannot be
increased or decreased. It is therefore said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.18), tal labhyate duhkhavad
anyatah sukham: "As far as material happiness is concerned, that comes without effort, just as tribulations
come without effort." Material happiness and pain can be attained without endeavor. One should not
bother for material activities. If one is at all sympathetic or able to do good to others, he should endeavor
to raise people to Krsna consciousness. In this way everyone advances spiritually by the grace of the Lord.
For our instruction, Bharata Maharaja acted in such a way. We should be very careful not to be misled by
so-called welfare activities conducted in bodily, terms. One should not give up his interest in attaining the
favor of Lord Visnu at any cost. Generally people do not know this, or they forget it. Consequently they
sacrifice their original interest, the attainment of Visnu's favor, and engage in philanthropic activities for
bodily comfort.
