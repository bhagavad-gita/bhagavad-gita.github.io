sri-suka uvaca
evam pitari sampravrtte tad-anusasane vartamana agnidhro jambudvipaukasah praja aurasavad
dharmaveksamanah paryagopayat.
SYNONYMS
sri-sukah--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami; uvaca--said; evam--thus; pitari--when his father; sampravrtte--took to
the path of liberation; tat-anusasane--according to his order; vartamanah--situated; agnidhrah--King
Agnidhra; jambu-dvipa-okasah--the inhabitants of Jambudvipa; prajah--citizens; aurasa-vat--as if they
were his sons; dharma--religious principles; aveksamanah--strictly observing; paryagopayat--completely
protected.
TRANSLATION
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: After his father, Maharaja Priyavrata, departed to follow the path of
spiritual life by undergoing austerities, King Agnidhra completely obeyed his order. Strictly observing the
principles of religion, he gave full protection to the inhabitants of Jambudvipa as if they were his own
begotten sons.
PURPORT
Following the instruction of his father, Maharaja Priyavrata, Maharaja Agnidhra ruled the inhabitants of
Jambudvipa according to religious principles. These principles are exactly contrary to the modern
principles of faithlessness. As clearly stated here, the King protected the citizens the way a father protects
his begotten children. How he ruled the citizens is also described here--dharmaveksamanah, strictly
according to religious principles. It is the duty of the executive head of a state to see that the citizens
strictly follow religious principles. The Vedic religious principles begin with varnasrama-dharma, the
duties of the four varnas and four asramas. Dharma refers to principles given by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The first principle of dharma, or religion, is to observe the duties of the four orders as
enjoined by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to people's qualities and activities, society
should be divided into brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras and then again into brahmacaris,
grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis. These are religious principles, and it is the duty of the head of
state to see that his citizens strictly follow them. He should not merely act officially; he should be like a
father who is always a well-wisher of his sons. Such a father strictly observes whether his sons are
performing their duties, and sometimes he also punishes them.
Just contrary to the principles mentioned here, the presidents and chief executives in the age of Kali are
simply tax collectors who do not care whether religious principles are observed. Indeed, the chief
executives of the present day introduce all kinds of sinful activity, especially illicit sex, intoxication,
animal killing and gambling. These sinful activities are now very prominently manifested in India.
Although a hundred years ago these four principles of sinful life were strictly prohibited in the families of
India, they have now been introduced into every Indian family; therefore they cannot follow religious
principles. In contrast to the principles of the kings of old, the modern state is concerned only with
propaganda for levying taxes and is no longer responsible for the spiritual welfare of the citizens. The
state is now callous to religious principles. Srimad-Bhagavatam predicts that in Kali-yuga the government
will be entrusted with dasyu-dharma, which means the occupational duty of rogues and thieves. Modern
heads of state are rogues and thieves who plunder the citizens instead of giving them protection. Rogues
and thieves plunder without regard for law, but in this age of Kali, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, the
lawmakers themselves plunder the citizens. The next prediction to be fulfilled, which is already coming to
pass, is that because of the sinful activities of the citizens and the government, rain will become
increasingly scarce. Gradually there will be complete drought and no production of food grains. People
will be reduced to eating flesh and seeds, and many good, spiritually inclined people will have to forsake
their homes because they will be too harassed by drought, taxation and famine. The Krsna consciousness
movement is the only hope to save the world from such devastation. It is the most scientific and
authorized movement for the actual welfare of the whole human society.
