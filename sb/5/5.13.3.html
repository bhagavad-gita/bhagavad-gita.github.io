<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, family members in this material world go under the names of wife and children, but
actually they behave like tigers and jackals. A herdsman tries to protect his sheep to the best of his ability,
but the tigers and foxes take them away by force. Similarly, although a miserly man wants to guard his
money very carefully, his family members take away all his assets forcibly, even though he is very vigilant.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One Hindi poet has sung: din ka dakini rat ka baghini palak palak rahu cuse. During the daytime, the
wife is compared to a witch, and at night she is compared to a tigress. Her only business is sucking the
blood of her husband both day and night. During the day there are household expenditures, and the
money earned by the husband at the cost of his blood is taken away. At night, due to sex pleasure, the
husband discharges blood in the form of semen. In this way he is bled by his wife both day and night, yet
he is so crazy that he very carefully maintains her. Similarly, the children are also like tigers, jackals and
foxes. As tigers, jackals and foxes take away lambs despite the herdsman's vigilant protection, children
take away the father's money, although the father supervises the money himself. Thus family members
may be called wives and children, but actually they are plunderers.
