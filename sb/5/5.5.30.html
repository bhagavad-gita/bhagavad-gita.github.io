<h2>Translation</h2>
Rsabhadeva began to tour through cities, villages, mines, countrysides, valleys, gardens, military camps,
cow pens, the homes of cowherd men, transient hotels, hills, forests and hermitages. Wherever He
traveled, all bad elements surrounded Him, just as flies surround the body of an elephant coming from a
forest. He was always being threatened, beaten, urinated upon and spat upon. Sometimes people threw
stones, stool and dust at Him, and sometimes people passed foul air before Him. Thus people called Him
many bad names and gave Him a great deal of trouble, but He did not care about this, for He understood
that the body is simply meant for such an end. He was situated on the spiritual platform, and, being in His
spiritual glory, He did not care for all these material insults. In other words, He completely understood
that matter and spirit are separate, and He had no bodily conception. Thus, without being angry at
anyone, He walked through the whole world alone.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narottama dasa Thakura says: deha-smrti nahi yara, samsara bandhana kahan tara. When a person fully
realizes that the material body and world are temporary, he is not concerned with pain and pleasures of
the body. As Sri Krsna advises in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed."
As far as Rsabhadeva is concerned, it has already been explained: idam sariram mama durvibhavyam. He
did not at all possess a material body; and therefore He was tolerant of all the trouble offered to Him by
the bad elements in society. Consequently He could tolerate people's throwing stool and dust upon Him
and beating Him. His body was transcendental and consequently did not at all suffer pain. He was always
situated in His spiritual bliss. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna. and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."
Since the Lord is situated in everyone's heart, He is in the heart of hogs and dogs also. If hogs and dogs
in their material bodies live in filthy places, one should not think that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in His Paramatma feature also lives in a filthy place. Although Lord Rsabhadeva was maltreated
by the bad elements of the world. He was not at all affected. Therefore it is stated here. sva-mahimaavasthanena:
"He was situated in His own glory." He was never saddened due to being insulted in the
many ways described above.
