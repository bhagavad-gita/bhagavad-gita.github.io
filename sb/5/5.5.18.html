such a person; syat--should become; pita--a father; na--not; sah--he; syat--should become; janani--a
mother; na--not; sa--she; syat--should become; daivam--the worshipable deity; na--not; tat--that; syat--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"One who cannot deliver his dependents from the path of repeated birth and death should never
become a spiritual master, a father, a husband, a mother or a worshipable demigod.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many spiritual masters, but Rsabhadeva advises that one should not become a spiritual master
if he is unable to save his disciple from the path of birth and death. Unless one is a pure devotee of Krsna.
he cannot save himself from the path of repeated birth and death. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam
eti so'rjuna. One can stop birth and death only by returning home, back to Godhead. However. who can
go back to Godhead unless he understands the Supreme Lord in truth? Janma karma ca me divyam evam
yo vetti tattvatah.
We have many instances in history illustrating Rsabhadeva's instructions. Sukracarya was rejected by
Bali Maharaja due to his inability to save Bali Maharaja from the path of repeated birth and death.
Sukracarya was not a pure devotee, he was more or less inclined to fruitive activity, and he objected when
Bali Maharaja promised to give everything to Lord Visnu. Actually one is supposed to give everything to
the Lord because everything belongs to the Lord. Consequently, the Supreme Lord advises in Bhagavadgita
(9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
"O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all
austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me." This is bhakti. Unless one is
devoted, he cannot give everything to the Supreme Lord. Unless one can do so, he cannot become a
spiritual master, husband, father or mother. Similarly, the wives of the brahmanas who were performing
sacrifices gave up their relatives just to satisfy Krsna. This is an example of a wife rejecting a husband who
cannot deliver her from the impending dangers of birth and death. Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja rejected
his father, and Bharata Maharaja rejected his mother (janani na sa syat). The word daivam indicates a
demigod or one who accepts worship from a dependent. Ordinarily, the spiritual master, husband, father,
mother or superior relative accepts worship from an inferior relative, but here Rsabhadeva forbids this.
First the father, spiritual master or husband must be able to release the dependent from repeated birth and
death. If he cannot do this, he plunges himself into the ocean of reproachment for his unlawful activities.
Everyone should be very responsible and take charge of his dependents just as a spiritual master takes
charge of his disciple or a father takes charge of his son. All these responsibilities cannot be discharged
honestly unless one can save the dependent from repeated birth and death.
