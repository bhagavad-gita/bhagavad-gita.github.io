<h2>Text</h2>
tasya ha yah purisa-surabhi-saugandhya-vayus tam desam dasa-yojanam samantat surabhim cakara.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--His; ha--indeed; yah--which; purisa--of the stool; surabhi--by the aroma; saugandhya--possessing
a good fragrance; vayuh--the air; tam--that; desam--country; dasa--up to ten; yojanam--yojanas (one
yojana equals eight miles); samantat--all around; surabhim--aromatic; cakara--made.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because Lord Rsabhadeva remained in that condition, the public did not disturb Him, but no bad aroma
emanated from His stool and urine. Quite the contrary, His stool and urine were so aromatic that they
filled eighty miles of the countryside with a pleasant fragrance.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this we can certainly assume that Lord Rsabhadeva was transcendentally blissful. His stool and
urine were so completely different from material stool and urine that they were aromatic. Even in the
material world, cow dung is accepted as purified and antiseptic. A person can keep stacks of cow dung in
one place, and it will not create a bad odor to disturb anyone. We can take it for granted that in the
spiritual world, stool and urine are also pleasantly scented. Indeed, the entire atmosphere became very
pleasant due to Lord Rsabhadeva's stool and urine.
