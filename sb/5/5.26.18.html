TRANSLATION
A person is considered no better than a crow if after receiving some food, he does not divide it among
guests, old men and children, but simply eats it himself, or if he eats it without performing the five kinds
of sacrifice. After death he is put into the most abominable hell, known as Krmibhojana. In that hell is a
lake becomes a worm in that lake and feeds on the other worms there, who also feed on him. Unless he
atones for his actions before his death, such a sinful man remains in the hellish lake of Krmibhojana for as
many years as there are yojanas in the width of the lake.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.13):
yajna-sistasinah santo
mucyante sarva-kilbisaih
bhunjate te tv agham papa
ya pacanty atma-karanat
"The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is first offered
for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin." All food is given
to us by the Supreme personality of Godhead. Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: the Lord supplies
everyone with the necessities of life. Therefore we should acknowledge His mercy by performing yajna
(sacrifice). This is the duty of everyone. Indeed, the sole purpose of life is to perform yajna. According to
Krsna (Bg. 3.9):
yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra
loko 'yam karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samacara
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material
world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you
will always remain unattached and free from bondage." If we do not perform yajna and distribute prasada
to others, our lives are condemned. Only after performing yajna and distributing the prasada to all
dependents--children, brahmanas and old men--should one eat. However, one who cooks only for himself
or his family is condemned, along with everyone he feeds. After death he is put into the hell known as
Krmibhojana.
