<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although Bharata Maharaja received the body of a deer, by constant repentance he became completely
detached from all material things. He did not disclose these things to anyone, but he left his mother deer
in a place known as Kalanjara Mountain, where he was born. He again went to the forest of Salagrama and
to the asrama of Pulastya and Pulaha.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is significant that Maharaja Bharata, by the grace of Vasudeva. remembered his past life. He did not
waste a moment; he returned to Pulaha-asrama to the village known as Salagrama. Association is very
meaningful; therefore ISKCON tries to perfect one who enters the society. The members of this society
should always remember that the society is not like a free hotel. All the members should be very careful to
execute their spiritual duties so that whoever comes will automatically become a devotee and will be able
to return back to Godhead in this very life. Although Bharata Maharaja acquired the body of a deer, he
again left his hearth and home, in this case the Mountain Kalanjara. No one should be captivated by his
birthplace and family; one should take shelter of the association of devotees and cultivate Krsna
consciousness.
