<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Rsabhadeva, was fully aware of His true identity; therefore
He was self-sufficient, and He did not desire external gratification. There was no need for Him to aspire
for success, since He was complete in Himself. Those who unnecessarily engage in bodily conceptions and
create an atmosphere of materialism are always ignorant of their real self-interest. Out of His causeless
mercy, Lord Rsabhadeva taught the self's real identity and the goal of life. We therefore offer our
respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who appeared as Lord Rsabhadeva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the summary of this chapter, in which the activities of Lord Rsabhadeva are described. Being the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Rsabhadeva is complete in Himself. We living entities, as
parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, should follow the instructions of Lord Rsabhadeva and become
self-sufficient. We should not create unnecessary demands due to the bodily conception. When one is
self-realized, he is sufficiently satisfied due to being situated in his original spiritual position. As
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.54): Brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati. This is the goal of
all living entities. Even though one may be situated within this material world, he can become fully
satisfied and devoid of hankering and lamentation simply by following the instructions of the Lord as set
forth in Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam. Satisfaction through self-realization is called svarupananda.
The conditioned soul, eternally sleeping in darkness, does not understand his self-interest. He simply tries
to become happy by making material adjustments, but this is impossible. It is therefore said in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: due to gross ignorance, the conditioned soul does not
know that his real self-interest is to take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Visnu. To try to become happy by
adjusting the material atmosphere is a useless endeavor. Indeed, it is impossible. By His personal behavior
and instructions, Lord Rsabhadeva enlightened the conditioned soul and showed him how to become selfsufficient
in his spiritual identity.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Activities of Lord Rsabhadeva."
Chapter Seven
The Activities of King Bharata
In this chapter, the activities of King Bharata Maharaja, the emperor of the whole world, are described.
Bharata Maharaja performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic yajnas) and satisfied the Supreme Lord
by his different modes of worship. in due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed
his days in devotional activities. Being ordered by his father, Lord Rsabhadeva, Bharata Maharaja married
Pancajani, the daughter of Visvarupa. After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully. Formerly this planet
was known as Ajanabha, and after the reign of Bharata Maharaja it became known as Bharata-varsa.
Bharata Maharaja begot five sons in the womb of Pancajani, and he named the sons Sumati, Rastrabhrta,
Sudarsana, Avarana and Dhumraketu. Bharata Maharaja was very rigid in executing religious principles
and following in the footsteps of his father. He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully. Because he
performed various yajnas to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied. Being of
undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord Vasudeva. Bharata Maharaja was
competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like Narada, and he followed in the footsteps
of the sages. He also kept Lord Vasudeva constantly within his heart. After finishing his kingly duties, he
divided his kingdom among his five sons. He then left home and went to the place of Pulaha known as
Pulahasrama. There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord Vasudeva with everything
available. Thus he increased his devotion toward Vasudeva, and he automatically began to realize further
his transcendental, blissful life. Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes
visible in his body the asta-sattvika transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which
are symptoms of love of Godhead. It is understood that Maharaja Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord
with the mantras mentioned in the Rg Veda, generally known as Gayatri mantra, which aim at the
Supreme Narayana situated within the sun.
