<h2>Translation</h2>
Accompanied during the daytime by the sons of the Prajapati [the predominating deities of the days]
and accompanied at night by his daughters [the deities of the nights], Laksmidevi worships the Lord
during the period known as the Samvatsara in His most merciful form as Kamadeva. Fully absorbed in
devotional service, she chants the following mantras.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word mayamayam used in this verse should not be understood according to the interpretations of
the Mayavadis. Maya means affection as well as illusion. When a mother deals with her child
affectionately, she is called mayamaya. In whatever form the Supreme Lord Visnu appears, He is always
affectionate toward His devotees. Thus the word mayamayam is used here to mean "very affectionate
toward the devotees." Srila Jiva Gosvami writes in this regard that mayamayam can also mean krpapracuram,
deeply merciful. Similarly, Srila Viraraghava says, maya-pracuranatmiya-sankalpena
parigrhitam ity arthah jnana-paryayo'tra maya-sabdah: when one is very affectionate due to an intimate
relationship, one is described as mayamaya. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains mayamayam by
dividing it into the words maya and amayam. He explains these words to indicate that because the living
entity is covered by the disease of illusion, the Lord is always eager to deliver His devotee from the
clutches of maya and cure him of the disease caused by the illusory energy.
