ekadasat-prasangan nikrta-matir vyudaka-srotah-skhalanavad ubhayato 'pi duhkhadam pakhandam
abhiyati.
SYNONYMS
ekada--sometimes; asat-prasangat--by association of nondevotees who are against the Vedic principles
and who manufacture different paths of religion; nikrta-matih--whose intelligence has been brought to the
abominable status of defying the authority of the Supreme personality of Godhead; vyudaka-srotah--into
rivers without sufficient water; skhalana-vat--like jumping; ubhayatah--from both sides; api--although;
duhkha-dam--giving distress; pakhandam--the atheistic path; abhiyati--he approaches.
TRANSLATION
Sometimes, to mitigate distresses in this forest of the material world, the conditioned soul receives
cheap blessings from atheists. He then loses all intelligence in their association. This is exactly like
jumping in a shallow river. As a result one simply breaks his head. He is not able to mitigate his sufferings
from the heat, and in both ways he suffers. The misguided conditioned soul also approaches so-called
sadhus and svamis who preach against the principles of the Vedas. He does not receive benefit from them,
either in the present or in the future.
PURPORT
Cheaters are always there to manufacture their own way of spiritual realization. To get some material
benefit, the conditioned soul approaches these pseudo sannyasis and yogis for cheap blessings, but he
does not receive any benefit from them, either spiritual or material. In this age there are many cheaters
who show some jugglery and magic. They even create gold to amaze their followers, and their followers
accept them as God. This type of cheating is very prominent in Kali-yuga. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura
describes the real guru in this way.
samsara-davanala-lidha-lokatranaya
karunya-ghanaghanatvam
praptasya kalyana-gunarnavasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam
One should approach a guru who can extinguish the blazing fire of this material world, the struggle for
existence. people want to be cheated. and therefore they go to yogis and svamis who play tricks, but tricks
do not mitigate the miseries of material life. If being able to manufacture gold is a criterion for becoming
God, then why not accept Krsna, the proprietor of the entire universe, wherein there are countless tons of
gold? As mentioned before, the color of gold is compared to the will-O'-the-wisp or yellow stool; therefore
one should not be allured by gold-manufacturing gurus but should sincerely approach a devotee like Jada
Bharata. Jada Bharata instructed Rahugana Maharaja so well that the King was relieved from the bodily
conception. One cannot become happy by accepting a false guru. A guru should be accepted as advised in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.3.21). Tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam: One should approach a
bona fide guru to inquire about the highest benefit of life. Such a guru is described as follows: sabde pare
ca nisnatam. Such a guru does not manufacture gold or juggle words. He is well versed in the conclusions
of Vedic knowledge (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). He is freed from all material contamination and
is fully engaged in Krsna's service. If one is able to obtain the dust of the lotus feet of such a guru, his life
becomes successful. Otherwise he is baffled both in this life and in the next.
