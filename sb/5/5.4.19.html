<h2>Translation</h2>
Once while touring the world, Lord Rsabhadeva, the Supreme Lord, reached a place known as
Brahmavarta. There was a great conference of learned brahmanas at that place, and all the King's sons
attentively heard the instructions of the brahmanas there. At that assembly, within the hearing of the
citizens, Rsabhadeva instructed His sons, although they were already very well behaved, devoted and
qualified. He instructed them so that in the future they could rule the world very perfectly. Thus he spoke
as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The instructions of Lord Rsabhadeva to His sons are very valuable if one wants to live peacefully within
this world, which is full of miseries. In the next chapter, Lord Rsabhadeva gives His sons these valuable
instructions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Characteristics of Rsabhadeva, the Supreme personality of Godhead."
Chapter Five
Lord Rsabhadeva's Teachings to His Sons
Lord Rsabhadeva' s Teachings to His Sons
In this chapter there is a description of bhagavata-dharma, religious principles in devotional service that
transcend religious principles for liberation and the mitigation of material misery. It is stated in this
chapter that a human being should not work hard like dogs and hogs for sense gratification. The human
life is especially meant for the revival of our relationship with the Supreme Lord, and to this end all kinds
of austerities and penances should be accepted. By austere activities, one's heart can be cleansed of
material contamination, and as a result one can be situated on the spiritual platform. To attain this
perfection, one has to take shelter of a devotee and serve him. Then the door of liberation will be open.
Those who are materially attached to women and sense gratification gradually become entangled in
material consciousness and suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Those who are engaged
in the general welfare of all and who are not attached to children and family are called mahatmas. Those
who are engaged in sense gratification. who act piously or impiously, cannot understand the purpose of
the soul. Therefore they should approach a highly elevated devotee and accept him as a spiritual master.
By his association, one will be able to understand the purpose of life. Under the instructions of such a
spiritual master, one can attain devotional service to the Lord, detachment from material things, and
tolerance of material misery and distress. One can then see all living entities equally, and one becomes
very eager to know about transcendental subject matters. Endeavoring persistently for the satisfaction of
Krsna, one becomes detached from wife, children and home. He is not interested in wasting time. In this
way one becomes self-realized. A person advanced in spiritual knowledge does not engage anyone in
material activity. And one who cannot deliver another person by instructing him in devotional service
should not become a spiritual master, father, mother, demigod or husband. Instructing His one hundred
sons, Lord Rsabhadeva advised them to accept their eldest brother. Bharata. as their guide and lord, and
thereby serve him. Of all living entities, the brahmanas are the best, and above the brahmanas the
Vaisnavas are situated in an even better position. Serving a Vaisnava means serving the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes the characteristics of Bharata Maharaja and the
sacrificial performance executed by Lord Rsabhadeva for the instruction of the general populace.
