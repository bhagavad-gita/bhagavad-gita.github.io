<h2>Text</h2>

pratyak prasantam bhagavac-chabda-samjnam
yad vasudevam kavayo vadanti
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jnanam--the supreme knowledge; visuddham--without contamination; parama-artham--giving the
ultimate goal of life; ekam--unified; anantaram--without interior, unbroken; tu--also; abahih--without
exterior; brahma--the Supreme; satyam--Absolute Truth; pratyak--inner; prasantam--the calm and
peaceful Supreme Lord, worshiped by the yogis; bhagavat-sabda-samjnam--known in the higher sense as
Bhagavan, or full of all opulences; yat--that; vasudevam--Lord Krsna, the son of Vasudeva; kavayah--the
learned scholars; vadanti--say.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What, then, is the ultimate truth? The answer is that nondual knowledge is the ultimate truth. It is
devoid of the contamination of material qualities. It gives us liberation. It is the one without a second, allpervading
and beyond imagination. The first realization of that knowledge is Brahman. Then Paramatma,
the Supersoul, is realized by the yogis who try to see Him without grievance. This is the second stage of
realization. Finally, full realization of the same supreme knowledge is realized in the Supreme Person. All
learned scholars describe the Supreme Person as Vasudeva, the cause of Brahman, Paramatma and others.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Caitanya-caritamrta it is said: yad advaitam brahmopanisadi tad apy asya tanu-bha. The impersonal
Brahman effulgence of the Absolute Truth consists of the bodily rays of the Supreme personality of
Godhead. Ya atmantaryami purusa iti so 'syamsa-vibhavah. What is known as atma and antaryami, the
Supersoul, is but an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sad-aisvaryaih purno ya iha
bhagavan sa svayam ayam. What is described as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, complete with all
six opulences, is Vasudeva, and Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is nondifferent from Him. Great learned
scholars and philosophers accept this after many, many births. Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma
sudurlabhah (Bg. 7.19). The wise man can understand that ultimately Vasudeva, Krsna, is the cause of
Brahman, and Paramatma, the Supersoul. Thus Vasudeva is sarva-karana-karanam, the cause of all causes.
This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam. The real tattva, Absolute Truth, is Bhagavan, but due to
incomplete realization of the Absolute Truth, people sometimes describe the same Visnu as impersonal
Brahman or localized Paramatma.
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
(Bhag. 1.2.11)
From the very beginning, Srimad-Bhagavatam says, satyam param dhimahi: we meditate on the supreme
truth. The supreme truth is explained here as jnanam visuddham satyam. The Absolute Truth is devoid of
material contamination and is transcendental to the material qualities. It gives all spiritual success and
liberation from this material world. That Supreme Absolute Truth is Krsna, Vasudeva. There is no
difference between Krsna's inner self and outward body. Krsna is purna, the complete whole. There is no
distinction between His body and soul as there is between ours. Sometimes so-called scholars, not
knowing the constitutional position of Krsna, mislead people by saying that the Krsna within is different
from the Krsna without. When Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru, socalled
scholars advise the reader that it is not the person Krsna to whom we must surrender but the Krsna
within. So-called scholars, Mayavadis, cannot understand Krsna with their poor fund of knowledge. One
should therefore approach an authorized person to understand Krsna. The spiritual master has actually
seen Krsna; therefore he can explain Him properly.
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
(Bg. 4.34)
Without approaching an authorized person, one cannot understand Krsna.
