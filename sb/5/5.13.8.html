TRANSLATION
Sometimes the merchant in the forest wants to climb the hills and mountains, but due to insufficient
footwear, his feet are pricked by small stone fragments and by thorns on the mountain. Being pricked by
them, he becomes very aggrieved. Sometimes a person who is very attached to his family becomes
overwhelmed with hunger, and due to his miserable condition he becomes furious with his family
members.
PURPORT
The ambitious conditioned soul wants to be very happy in this material world with his family, but he is
compared to a traveler in the forest who desires to climb a hill full of thorns and small stones. As stated in
the previous verse, the happiness derived from society, friendship and love is like a drop of water in the
scorching heat of the desert. One may want to become very great and powerful in society, but this is like
attempting to climb a hill full of thorns. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura compares one's family to
high mountains. Becoming happy in their association is like a hungry man's endeavoring to climb a
mountain full of thorns. Almost 99.9 percent of the population is unhappy in family life. despite all the
attempts being made to satisfy the family members. In the Western countries, due to the dissatisfaction of
the family members. there is actually no family life. There are many cases of divorce, and out of
dissatisfaction, the children leave the protection of their parents. Especially in this age of Kali, family life
is being reduced. Everyone is becoming self-centered because that is the law of nature. Even if one has
sufficient money to maintain a family, the situation is such that no one is happy in family life.
Consequently according to the varnasrama institution, one has to retire from family life in middle age:
pancasordhvam vanam vrajet. One should voluntarily retire from family life at the age of fifty and go to
Vrndavana or a forest. This is recommended by Srila Prahlada Maharaja (Bhag. 7.5.5):
tat sadhu manye 'sura-varya dehinam
sada samudvigna-dhiyam asad-grahat
hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam
vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta
There is no benefit in transferring from one forest to another. One must go to the Vrndavana forest and
take shelter of Govinda. That will make one happy. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness
is therefore constructing a Krsna-Balarama temple to invite its members as well as outsiders to come and
live peacefully in a spiritual atmosphere. That will help one become elevated to the transcendental world
and return home, back to Godhead. Another sentence in this verse is very significant: kautumbikah
krudhyati vai janaya. When one's mind is disturbed in so many ways, he satisfies himself by becoming
angry with his poor wife and children. The wife and children are naturally dependent on the father, but
the father, being unable to maintain the family properly, becomes mentally distressed and therefore
chastises the family members unnecessarily. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.9): acchinna-daradravina
yasyanti giri-kananam. Being disgusted with family life, one separates from the family by divorce
or some other means. If one has to separate, why not separate willingly? Systematic separation is better
than forced separation. Forced separation cannot make anyone happy, but by mutual consent or by the
Vedic arrangement one must separate from his family affairs at a certain age and fully depend on Krsna.
This makes one's life successful.
