<h2>Text</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus being always engaged; varsa-ayuta-sahasra--one thousand times ten thousand years;
paryanta--until then; avasita-karma-nirvana-avasarah--Maharaja Bharata who ascertained the moment of
the end of his royal opulence; adhibhujyamanam--being enjoyed in this way for that duration; svatanayebhyah--
unto his own sons; riktham--the wealth; pitr-paitamaham--which he received from his

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Destiny fixed the time for Maharaja Bharata's enjoyment of material opulence at one thousand times ten
thousand years. When that period was finished, he retired from family life and divided the wealth he had
received from his forefathers among his sons. He left his paternal home, the reservoir of all opulence, and
started for Pulahasrama, which is situated in Hardwar. The salagrama-silas are obtainable there.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the law of daya-bhak, when one inherits an estate, he must hand it over to the next
generation. Bharata Maharaja did this properly. First he enjoyed his paternal property for one thousand
times ten thousand years. At the time of his retirement, he divided this property among his sons and left
for Pulaha-asrama.
