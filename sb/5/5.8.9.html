<h2>Translation</h2>
The great King Maharaja Bharata began to think: Alas, this helpless young deer, by the force of time, an
agent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now lost its relatives and friends and has taken shelter
of me. It does not know anyone but me, as I have become its father, mother, brother and relatives. This
deer is thinking in this way, and it has full faith in me. It does not know anyone but me; therefore I
should not be envious and think that for the deer my own welfare will be destroyed. I should certainly
raise, protect, gratify and fondle it. When it has taken shelter with me, how can I neglect it? Even though
the deer is disturbing my spiritual life, I realize that a helpless person who has taken shelter cannot be
neglected. That would be a great fault.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a person is advanced in spiritual consciousness or Krsna consciousness, he naturally becomes
very sympathetic toward all living entities suffering in the material world. Naturally such an advanced
person thinks of the suffering of the people in general. However, if one does not know of the material
sufferings of fallen souls and becomes sympathetic because of bodily comforts, as in the case of Bharata
Maharaja, such sympathy or compassion is the cause of one's downfall. If one is actually sympathetic to
fallen, suffering humanity, he should try to elevate people from material consciousness to spiritual
consciousness. As far as the deer was concerned, Bharata Maharaja became very sympathetic, but he
forgot that it was impossible for him to elevate a deer to spiritual consciousness, because, after all, a deer
is but an animal. It was very dangerous for Bharata Maharaja to sacrifice all his regulative principles
simply to take care of an animal. The principles enunciated in Bhagavad-gita should be followed. Yam hi
na vyathayanty ete purusam purusarsabha. As far as the material body is concerned, we cannot do
anything for anyone. However, by the grace of Krsna, we may raise a person to spiritual consciousness if
we ourselves follow the rules and regulations. If we give up our own spiritual activities and simply
become concerned with the bodily comforts of others, we will fall into a dangerous position.
