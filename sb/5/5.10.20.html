sa vai bhaval loka-niriksanartham
avyakta-lingo vicaraty api svit
yogesvaranam gatim andha-buddhih
katham vicaksita grhanubandhah
SYNONYMS
sah--that Supreme Personality of Godhead or His incarnation Kapiladeva; vai--indeed; bhavan--your
good self; loka-niriksana-artham--just to study the characteristics of the people of this world; avyaktalingah--
without manifesting your real identity; vicarati--are traveling in this world; api svit--whether;
yoga-isvaranam--of all the advanced yogis; gatim--the characteristics or actual behavior; andha-buddhih--
who are illusioned and have become blind to spiritual knowledge; katham--how; vicaksita--may know;
grha-anubandhah--I who am bound by attachment to family life, or worldly life.
TRANSLATION
Is it not a fact that your good self is the direct representative of Kapiladeva, the incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead? To examine people and see who is actually a human being and who is
not, you have presented yourself to be a deaf and dumb person. Are you not moving this way upon the
surface of the world? I am very attached to family life and worldly activities, and I am blind to spiritual
knowledge. Nonetheless, I am now present before you and am seeking enlightenment from you. How can
I advance in spiritual life?
PURPORT
Although Maharaja Rahugana was playing the part of a king, he had been informed by Jada Bharata that
be was not a king nor was Jada Bharata deaf and dumb. Such designations were simply coverings of the
spirit soul. Everyone must come to this knowledge. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.13): dehino 'smin
yatha dehe. Everyone is encased within the body. Since the body is never identical with the soul, the
bodily activities are simply illusory. In the association of such a sadhu as Jada Bharata, Maharaja
Rahugana came to the awareness that his activities as a royal authority were simply illusory phenomena.
He therefore agreed to receive knowledge from Jada Bharata, and that was the beginning of his perfection.
Tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet. A person like Maharaja Rahugana, who was very inquisitive to
know the value of life and the spiritual science, must approach a personality like Jada Bharata. Tasmad
gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam (Bhag. 11.3.21). One must approach a guru like Jada Bharata, a
representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to inquire about the goal of human life.
