<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O unborn one, learned Vedic scholars who are advanced in spiritual knowledge certainly know that this
material world is perishable, as do other logicians and philosophers. In trance they realize the factual
position of this world, and they preach the truth as well. Yet even they are sometimes bewildered by Your
illusory energy. This is Your own wonderful pastime. Therefore, I can understand that Your illusory
energy is very wonderful, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Not only does the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead act on the conditioned soul
within this material world, but sometimes it also acts on the most advanced learned scholars, who
factually know the constitutional position of this material world through realization. As soon as someone
thinks, "I am this material body (aham mameti) and everything in relationship with this material body is
mine," he is in illusion (moha). This illusion caused by the material energy acts especially on the
conditioned souls, but it sometimes also acts on liberated souls as well. A liberated soul is a person who
has sufficient knowledge of this material world and is therefore unattached to the bodily conception of
life. But because of association with the modes of material nature for a very long time, even liberated souls
sometimes become captivated by the illusory energy due to inattentiveness in the transcendental position.
Therefore Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14), mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te:
"Only those who surrender unto Me can overcome the influence of the material energy." Therefore no
one should think of himself as a liberated person immune to the influence of maya. Everyone should very
cautiously execute devotional service by rigidly following regulative principles. Thus he will remain fixed
at the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise, a little inattention will create havoc. We have already seen an
example of this in the case of Maharaja Bharata. Maharaja Bharata was undoubtedly a great devotee, but
because he turned his attention slightly toward a small deer, he had to suffer two more births, one as a
deer and another as the brahmana Jada Bharata. Afterward he was liberated and went back home, back to
Godhead.
The Lord is always prepared to excuse His devotee, but if a devotee takes advantage of the Lord's
leniency and purposefully commits mistakes again and again, the Lord will certainly punish him by letting
him fall down into the clutches of the illusory energy. In other words, theoretical knowledge acquired by
studying the Vedas is insufficient to protect one from the clutches of maya. One must strongly adhere to
the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service. Then one's position is secure.
