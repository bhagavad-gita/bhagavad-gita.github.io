<h2>Translation</h2>
The illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all of us conditioned souls to this
material world. Therefore, without being favored by Him, persons like us cannot understand how to get
out of that illusory energy. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who is the cause of
creation and annihilation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna clearly states in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." All conditioned souls working
within the illusory energy of the Lord consider the body to be the self, and thus they continuously wander
throughout the universe, taking birth in different species of life and creating more and more problems.
Sometimes they become disgusted with the problems and seek out a process by which they can get out of
this entanglement. Unfortunately, such so-called research workers are unaware of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and His illusory energy, and thus all of them work only in darkness. never finding
a way out. So-called scientists and advanced research scholars are ludicrously trying to find the cause of
life. They take no notice of the fact that life is already being produced. What will be their credit if they
find out the chemical composition of life? All their chemicals are nothing but different transformations of
the five elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.20), the living entity is
never created (na jayate mriyate va kadacin). There are five gross material elements and three minor
material elements (mind, intelligence and ego), and there are eternal living entities. The living entity
desires a certain type of body, and by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that body is
created from material nature, which is nothing but a kind of machine handled by the Supreme Lord. The
Lord gives the living entity a particular type of mechanical body, and the living entity must work with it
according to the law of fruitive activities. Fruitive activities are described in this verse: karma-pamanim
mayam. The living entity is seated on a machine (the body), and according to the order of the Supreme
Lord, he operates the machine. This is the secret of transmigration of the soul from one body to another.
The living entity thus becomes entangled in fruitive activities in this material world. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (15.7), manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati: the living entity is struggling very
hard against the six senses, which include the mind.
In all the activities of creation and annihilation, the living entity is entangled in fruitive activities, which
are executed by the illusory energy, maya. He is exactly like a computer handled by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. The so-called scientists say that nature acts independently, but they cannot
explain what nature is. Nature is nothing but a machine operated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
When one understands the operator, his problems of life are solved. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(7.19):
bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be
the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." A sane man, therefore, surrenders to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus gets out of the clutches of the illusory energy, maya.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fifth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Descent of the River Ganges."
Chapter Eighteen
The Prayers Offered to the Lord by the Residents of Jambudvipa
In this chapter Sukadeva Gosvami describes the different varsas of Jambudvipa and the incarnation of
the Supreme Lord worshiped in each. The predominating ruler of Bhadrasva-varsa is Bhadrasrava. He and
his many servants always worship the incarnation known as Lord Hayagriva. At the end of each kalpa,
when the demon Ajnana steals the Vedic knowledge, Lord Hayagriva appears and preserves it. Then He
delivers it to Lord Brahma. In the land known as Hari-varsa, the exalted devotee Prahlada Maharaja
worships Lord Nrsimhadeva. (The appearance of Lord Nrsimhadeva is described in the Seventh Canto of
Srimad-Bhagavatam.) Following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, the inhabitants of Hari-varsa
always worship Lord Nrsimhadeva to receive from Him the benediction of being engaged in His loving
service. In the tract of land known as Ketumala-varsa, the Supreme personality of Godhead (Lord
Hrsikesa) appears in the form of Cupid. The goddess of fortune and the demigods living there engage in
His service day and night. Manifesting Himself in sixteen parts, Lord Hrsikesa is the source of all
encouragement, strength and influence. The conditioned living entity has the defect of being always
fearful, but simply by the mercy of the Supreme personality of Godhead, he can rid himself of this defect
of material life. Therefore the Lord alone can be addressed as master. In the tract of land known as
Ramyaka-varsa, Manu and all the inhabitants worship Matsyadeva to this very day. Matsyadeva, whose
form is pure goodness, is the ruler and maintainer of the whole universe, and as such He is the director of
all the demigods, headed by King Indra. In Hiranmaya-varsa Lord Visnu has assumed the form of a
tortoise (Kurma murti) and is worshiped there by Aryama, along with all the other residents. Similarly, in
the tract of land known as Uttarakuru-varsa, Lord Sri Hari has assumed the form of a boar, and in that
form He accepts service from all the inhabitants living there.
All the information in this chapter can be fully realized by one who associates with devotees of the Lord.
Therefore in the sastras it is recommended that one associate with devotees. This is better than residing
on the banks of the Ganges. In the hearts of pure devotees reside all good sentiments as well as all the
superior qualities of the demigods. In the hearts of nondevotees, however, there cannot be any good
qualities, for such people are simply enchanted by the external, illusory energy of the Lord. Following in
the footsteps of devotees, one should know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only
worshipable Deity. Everyone should accept this proposal and worship the Lord. As stated in Bhagavadgita
(15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the purpose of studying all Vedic literature is to worship
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. If after studying all the Vedic literature, one does not awaken
his dormant love for the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has labored for nothing. He has
simply wasted his time. Lacking attachment for the Supreme personality of Godhead, he remains attached
to family life in this material world. Thus the lesson of this chapter is that one should get out of family life
and completely take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.
