TRANSLATION
You are the original Personality of Godhead who expands Himself all over the creations and is
transcendental to material energy. You have cast away the effects of the material energy by dint of Your
spiritual potency. You are always situated in eternal bliss and transcendental knowledge.
PURPORT
The Lord states in the Bhagavad-gita that one who surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord can get
release from the clutches of nescience. Krsna is just like the sun, and maya or material existence is just
like darkness. Wherever there is the light of the sun, darkness or ignorance at once vanishes. The best
means to get out of the world of ignorance is suggested here. The Lord is addressed herein as the original
Personality of Godhead. From Him all other Personalities of Godhead expand. The all-pervasive Lord
Visnu is Lord Krsna's plenary portion or expansion. The Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms of
Godhead and living beings, along with His different energies. But Sri Krsna is the original primeval Lord
from whom everything emanates. The all-pervasive feature of the Lord experienced within the manifested
world is also a partial representation of the Lord. Paramatma, therefore, is included within Him. He is the
Absolute Personality of Godhead. He has nothing to do with the actions and reactions of the material
manifestation because He is far above the material creation. Darkness is a perverse representation of the
sun, and therefore the existence of darkness depends on the existence of the sun, but in the sun proper
there is no trace of darkness. As the sun is full of light only, similarly the Absolute Personality of
Godhead, beyond the material existence, is full of bliss. He is not only full of bliss, but also full of
transcendental variegatedness. Transcendence is not at all static, but full of dynamic variegatedness. He is
distinct from the material nature, which is complicated by the three modes of material nature. He is
parama, or the chief. Therefore He is absolute. He has manifold energies, and through His diverse energies
He creates, manifests, maintains and destroys the material world. In His own abode, however, everything
is eternal and absolute. The world is not conducted by the energies or powerful agents by themselves, but
by the potent all-powerful with all energies.
