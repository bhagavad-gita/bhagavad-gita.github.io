<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
ye va mayise krta-sauhrdartha
janesu dehambhara-vartikesu
grhesu jayatmaja-ratimatsu
na priti-yukta yavad-arthas ca loke
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ye--those who; va--or; mayi--unto Me; ise--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; krta-sauhrda-arthah--
very eager to develop love (in a relationship of dasya, sakhya, vatsalya or madhurya); janesu--to people;
dehambhara-vartikesu--who are interested only in maintaining the body, not in spiritual salvation;
grhesu--to the home; jaya--wife; atma-ja--children; rati--wealth or friends; matsu--consisting of; na--not;
priti-yuktah--very attached; yavat-arthah--who live by collecting only as much as required; ca--and; loke--
in the material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are interested in reviving Krsna consciousness and increasing their love of Godhead do not
like to do anything that is not related to Krsna. They are not interested in mingling with people who are
busy maintaining their bodies, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are not attached to their
homes, although they may be householders. Nor are they attached to wives, children, friends or wealth.
At the same time, they are not indifferent to the execution of their duties. Such people are interested in
collecting only enough money to keep the body and soul together.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Whether he is an impersonalist or a devotee, one who is actually interested in advancing spiritually
should not mingle with those who are simply interested in maintaining the body by means of the so-called
advancement of civilization. Those who are interested in spiritual life should not be attached to homely
comforts in the company of wife. children, friends and so forth. Even if one is a grhastha and has to earn
his livelihood, he should be satisfied by collecting only enough money to maintain body and soul
together. One should not have more than that nor less than that. As indicated herein, a householder
should endeavor to earn money for the execution of bhakti-yoga--sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam
pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. A householder should lead such a
life that he gets full opportunity to hear and chant. He should worship the Deity at home. observe
festivals, invite friends in and give them prasada. A householder should earn money for this purpose, not
for sense gratification.
