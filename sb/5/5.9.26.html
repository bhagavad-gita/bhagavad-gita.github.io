TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, in this way Bharata Maharaja was overwhelmed by an
uncontrollable desire which was manifest in the form of the deer. Due to the fruitive results of his past
deeds, he fell down from mystic yoga, austerity and worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If it
were not due to his past fruitive activity, how could he have been attracted to the deer after giving up the
association of his own son and family, considering them stumbling blocks on the path of spiritual life?
Mow could he show such uncontrollable affection for a deer? This was definitely due to his past karma.
The King was so engrossed in petting and maintaining the deer that he fell down from his spiritual
activities. In due course of time, insurmountable death, which is compared to a venomous snake that
enters the hole created by a mouse, situated itself before him.
PURPORT
As will be seen in later verses, Bharata Maharaja, at the time of death, would be forced to accept the
body of a deer due to his attraction for the deer. In this regard, a question may be raised. How can a
devotee be affected by his past misconduct and vicious activities? In Brahma-samhita (5.54) it is said,
karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam: "For those engaged in devotional service, bhakti-bhajana, the
results of past deeds are indemnified." According to this, Bharata Maharaja could not be punished for his
past misdeeds. The conclusion must be that Maharaja Bharata purposefully became over-addicted to the
deer and neglected his spiritual advancement. To immediately rectify his mistake. for a short time he was
awarded the body of a deer. This was just to increase his desire for mature devotional service. Although
Bharata Maharaja was awarded the body of an animal, he did not forget what had previously happened
due to his purposeful mistake. He was very anxious to get out of his deer body, and this indicates that his
affection for devotional service was intensified, so much so that he was quickly to attain perfection in a
brahmana body in the next life. It is with this conviction that we declare in our Back to Godhead
magazine that devotees like the gosvamis living in Vrndavana who purposely commit some sinful activity
are born in the bodies of dogs, monkeys and tortoises in that holy land. Thus they take on these lower life
forms for a short while. and after they give up those animal bodies, they are again promoted to the
spiritual world. Such punishment is only for a short period, and it is not due to past karma. It may appear
to be due to past karma, but it is offered to rectify the devotee and bring him to pure devotional service.
