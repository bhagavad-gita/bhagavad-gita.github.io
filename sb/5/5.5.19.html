<h2>Translation</h2>
My transcendental body [sac-cid-ananda-vigraha] looks exactly like a human form, but it is not a
material human body. It is inconceivable. I am not forced by nature to accept a particular type of body; I
take on a body by My own sweet will. My heart is also spiritual, and I always think of the welfare of My
devotees. Therefore within My heart can be found the process of devotional service, which is meant for
the devotees. Far from My heart have I abandoned irreligion [adharma] and nondevotional activities.
They do not appeal to Me. Due to all these transcendental qualities, people generally pray to Me as
Rsabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all living entities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words idam sariram mama durvibhavyam are very significant. Generally we experience
two energies--material energy and spiritual energy. We have some experience of the material energy
(earth. water, air, fire, ether, mind, intelligence and ego) because in the material world everyone's body is
composed of these elements. Within the material body is the spirit soul, but we cannot see it with the
material eyes. When we see a body full of spiritual energy, it is very difficult for us to understand how the
spiritual energy can have a body. It is said that Lord Rsabhadeva's body is completely spiritual; therefore
for a materialistic person, it is very difficult to understand. For a materialistic person, the completely
spiritual body is inconceivable. We have to accept the version of the Vedas when our experimental
perception cannot understand a subject. As stated in Brahma-samhita: isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cidananda-
vigrahah. The Supreme Lord has a body with form, but that body is not composed of material
elements. It is made of spiritual bliss, eternity and living force. By the inconceivable energy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord can appear before us in His original spiritual body, but because
we have no experience of the spiritual body, we are sometimes bewildered and see the form of the Lord as
material. The Mayavadi philosophers are completely unable to conceive of a spiritual body. They say that
the spirit is always impersonal, and whenever they see something personal, they take it for granted that it
is material. In Bhagavad-gita (9.11) it is said:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be."
Unintelligent people think that the Supreme Lord accepts a body composed of the material energy. We
can easily understand the material body, but we cannot understand the spiritual body. Therefore
Rsabhadeva says: idam sariram mama durvibhavyam. In the spiritual world, everyone has a spiritual body.
There is no conception of material existence there. In the spiritual world there is only service and the
receiving of service. There is only sevya, seva, and sevaka--the person served, the process of service and
the servant. These three items are completely spiritual, and therefore the spiritual world is called absolute.
There is no tinge of material contamination there. Being completely transcendental to the material
conception, Lord Rsabhadeva states that His heart is composed of dharma. Dharma is explained in
Bhagavad-gita (18.66): sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. In the spiritual world, every
living entity is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and is completely on the spiritual platform. Although
there are servitors, the served and service, all are spiritual and variegated. At the present moment, due to
our material conception. everything is durvibhavya, inconceivable. Being the Supreme, the Lord is called
Rsabha, the best. In terms of the Vedic language, nityo nityanam. We are also spiritual. but we are
subordinate. Krsna, the Supreme Lord, is the foremost living entity. The word rsabha means "the chief,"
or "the supreme," and indicates the Supreme Being, or God Himself.
