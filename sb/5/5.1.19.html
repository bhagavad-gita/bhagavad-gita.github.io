<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma continued: My dear Priyavrata, seek shelter inside the opening in the lotus of the feet of
the Lord, whose navel is also like a lotus. Thus conquer the six sense organs [the mind and knowledgeacquiring
senses]. Accept material enjoyment because the Lord, extraordinarily, has ordered you to do
this. You will thus always be liberated from material association and be able to carry out the Lord's orders
in your constitutional position.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three kinds of men within this material world. Those who are trying to enjoy the senses to the
utmost are called karmis, above them are the jnanis, who try to conquer the urges of the senses, and above
them are the yogis, who have already conquered the senses. None of them, however, are situated in a
transcendental position. Only devotees. who belong to none of the above-mentioned groups, are
transcendental. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." Lord Brahma herein
advises Priyavrata to remain transcendental in the fortress not of family life but of the lotus feet of the
Lord (abja-nabhanghri-saroja). When a bumblebee enters the opening of a lotus flower and drinks its
honey, it is fully protected by the petals of the lotus. The bee is undisturbed by sunshine and other
external influences. Similarly, one who always seeks shelter at the lotus feet of the personality of Godhead
is protected from all dangers. It is therefore said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.58):
samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam
mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh
bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam
padam padam yad vipadam na tesam
For one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, everything becomes easier. Indeed, even
crossing the great ocean of nescience (bhavambudhi) is exactly like crossing the hoofprint created by a
calf (vatsa-padam). For such a devotee, there is no question of remaining in a place where every step is
dangerous.
Our actual duty is to carry out the supreme order of the Personality of Godhead. If we are fixed in our
determination to carry out the supreme order of the Lord, we are always secure, regardless of where we
are situated, whether in hell or in heaven. Herein the words prakrtim bhajasva are very significant.
Prakrtim refers to one's constitutional position. Every living entity has the constitutional position of being
an eternal servant of God. Therefore Lord Brahma advised Priyavrata, "Be situated in your original
position as an eternal servant of the Lord. If you carry out His orders, you will never fall, even in the
midst of material enjoyment." Material enjoyment achieved by dint of one's fruitive activities differs from
material enjoyment given by the Supreme personality of Godhead. A devotee sometimes appears to be in a
very opulent position, but he accepts that position to follow the orders of the Supreme personality of
Godhead. Therefore a devotee is never affected by material influences. The devotees in the Krsna
consciousness movement are preaching all over the world in accordance with the order of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. They have to meet many karmis, but by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they are
unaffected by material influences. He has blessed them, as described in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya
7.129):
kabhu na badhibe tomara visaya-taranga
punarapi ei thani pabe mora sange
A sincere devotee who engages in the service of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by preaching His cult all
over the world will never be affected by visaya-taranga, material influences. On the contrary, in due
course of time he will return to the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and will thus
have perpetual association with Him.
