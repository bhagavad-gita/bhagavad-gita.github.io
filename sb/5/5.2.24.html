<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, Maharaja Priyavrata married Barhismati, the daughter of the prajapati named Visvakarma. In
her he begot ten sons equal to him in beauty, character, magnanimity and other qualities. He also begot a
daughter, the youngest of all, named Urjasvati.
PURPORT
Maharaja Priyavrata not only carried out the order of Lord Brahma by accepting the duties of
government, but also married Barhismati, the daughter of Visvakarma, one of the prajapatis. Since
Maharaja Priyavrata was fully trained in transcendental knowledge, he could have returned home and
conducted the business of government as a brahmacari. Instead, however, when he returned to household
life, he accepted a wife also. The principle is that when one becomes a grhastha, he must live perfectly in
that order, which means he must live peacefully with a wife and children. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu's
first wife died, His mother requested Him to marry for a second time. He was twenty years old and was
going to take sannyasa at the age of twenty-four, yet by the request of His mother, He married. "As long as
I am in household life," He told His mother, "I must have a wife, for household life does not mean staying
in a house. Real household life means living in a house with a wife."
Three words in this verse are very significant--u ha vava. These words are used to express wonder.
Priyavrata Maharaja had taken a vow of renunciation, but accepting a wife and begetting children have
nothing to do with the path of renunciation; these are activities on the path of enjoyment. It was a source
of great wonder, therefore, that Priyavrata Maharaja, who had followed the path of renunciation, had now
accepted the path of enjoyment.
Sometimes we are criticized because although I am a sannyasi, I have taken part in the marriage
ceremonies of my disciples. It must be explained, however, that since we have started a Krsna conscious
society and since a human society must also have ideal marriages, to correctly establish an ideal society
we must take part in marrying some of its members, although we have taken to the path of renunciation.
This may be astonishing to persons who are not very interested in establishing daiva-varnasrama, the
transcendental system of four social orders and four spiritual orders. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura, however, wanted to reestablish daiva-varnasrama. In daiva-varnasrama there cannot be
acknowledgement of social status according to birthright because in Bhagavad-gita it is said that the
determining considerations are guna and karma, one's qualities and work. It is this daiva-varnasrama that
should be established all over the world to continue a perfect society for Krsna consciousness. This may
be astonishing to foolish critics, but it is one of the functions of a Krsna conscious society.
