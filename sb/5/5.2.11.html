TRANSLATION
Lord Brahma, the supreme person within this universe, said: My dear Priyavrata, kindly hear attentively
what I shall say to you. Do not be jealous of the Supreme Lord, who is beyond our experimental
measurements. All of us, including Lord Siva, your father and the great sage Maharsi Narada, must carry
out the order of the Supreme. We cannot deviate from His order.
PURPORT
Of the twelve great authorities in devotional service, four--Lord Brahma himself, his son Narada,
Svayambhuva Manu and Lord Siva--were present before Priyavrata. They were accompanied by many
other authoritative sages. Brahma first wanted to impress upon Priyavrata that although these great
personalities are all authorities, they cannot possibly disobey the orders of the Supreme personality of
Godhead, who is described in this verse as deva, which means "always glorious." The power, glory and
potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can never be diminished. In the Isopanisad, the Lord is
described as apapa-viddha, which indicates that He is never affected by anything materially considered
sinful. Similarly, Srimad-Bhagavatam describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as being so powerful
that nothing we might consider abominable can affect Him. An example sometimes given to explain the
position of the Supreme Lord is that of the sun, which evaporates urine from the earth but is never
affected by contamination. The Supreme Lord can never be accused of doing anything wrong.
When Lord Brahma went to induce Priyavrata to accept the responsibility for ruling the universe, he did
not go whimsically; he was following the dictations of the Supreme Lord. Indeed, Brahma and other
genuine authorities never do anything without His permission. The Supreme Lord is situated in
everyone's heart. In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said, tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye: the
Lord dictated Vedic knowledge to Brahma through his heart. The more a living entity is purified by
devotional service, the more he comes in direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as
confirmed in Srimad Bhagavad-gita:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me." (Bg. 10.10) Lord Brahma, therefore, had not come to Priyavrata by his own whims:
rather, it is understood that he had been ordered to persuade Priyavrata by the Supreme personality of
Godhead, whose activities cannot be understood by material senses and who is therefore described herein
as aprameya. Thus Lord Brahma first advised Priyavrata to hear his words with attention and without
envy.
Why one is induced to perform certain acts despite his desire to do something else is indicated herein.
One cannot disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord, even if one is as powerful as Lord Siva. Lord Brahma.
Manu or the great sage Narada. All these authorities are certainly very powerful, but they do not have the
power to disobey the orders of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Since Lord Brahma had come to
Priyavrata in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Lord, he first wanted to dispel any suspicions
that he might be acting as Priyavrata's enemy. Lord Brahma was following the orders of the Supreme Lord,
and therefore it would be worthwhile for Priyavrata to accept Lord Brahma's order, as the Lord desired.
