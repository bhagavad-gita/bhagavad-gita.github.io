<h2>Translation</h2>
Agnidhra then praised Purvacitti's raised breasts. He said: My dear brahmana your waist is very thin, yet
with great difficulty you are carefully carrying two horns, to which my eyes have become attracted. What
is filling those two beautiful horns? You seem to have spread fragrant red powder upon them, powder that
is like the rising morning sun. O most fortunate one, I beg to inquire where you have gotten this fragrant
powder that is perfuming my asrama, my place of residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Agnidhra appreciated Purvacitti's raised breasts. After seeing the girl's breasts, he became almost mad.
Nevertheless, he could not recognize whether Purvacitti was a boy or a girl, for as a result of his austerity,
he saw no distinction between the two. He therefore addressed her with the word dvija, "O brahmana."
Yet why should a dvija, a brahmana boy, have horns on his chest? Because the boy's waist was thin,
Agnidhra thought, he was carrying the horns with great difficulty. and therefore they must be filled with
something very valuable. Otherwise why would he carry them? When a woman's waist is thin and her
breasts are full, she looks very attractive. Agnidhra, his eyes attracted. contemplated the heavy breasts on
the girl's thin body and imagined how her back must sustain them. Agnidhra imagined that her raised
breasts were two horns she had covered with cloth so that others would not see the valuables within
them. Agnidhra, however, was very anxious to see them. Therefore he requested, "Please uncover them so
that I can see what you are carrying. Rest assured that I shall not take it away. If you feel an inconvenience
in removing the covering, I can help you; I myself can uncover them to see what valuable things those
raised horns contain." He was also surprised to see the red dust of perfumed kunkuma spread over her
breasts. Nevertheless, still considering Purvacitti a boy, Agnidhra addressed her as subhaga, most
fortunate muni. The boy must have been fortunate; otherwise how simply by standing there could he
perfume Agnidhra's entire asrama?
