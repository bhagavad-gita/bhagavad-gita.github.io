<h2>Translation</h2>
Jada Bharata used to work only for food. His stepbrothers took advantage of this and engaged him in
agricultural field work in exchange for some food, but actually he did not know how to work very well in
the field. He did not know where to spread dirt or where to make the ground level or uneven. His
brothers used to give him broken rice, oil cakes, the chaff of rice, worm-eaten grains and burned grains
that had stuck to the pot, but he gladly accepted all this as if it were nectar. He did not hold any grudges
and ate all this very gladly.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The platform of paramahamsa is described in Bhagavad-gita (2.15): sama-duhkha-sukham dhiram so
'mrtatvaya kalpate. When one is callous to all duality, the happiness and distress of this material world,
one is fit for amrtatva, eternal life. Bharata Maharaja was determined to finish his business in this material
world, and he did not at all care for the world of duality. He was complete in Krsna consciousness and
was oblivious to good and evil, happiness and distress. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 4.176):
'dvaite' bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba-'manodharma'
'ei bhala, ei manda',----saba 'bhrama'
"In the material world, conceptions of good and bad are all mental speculations. Therefore, saying, 'This
is good and this is bad,' is all a mistake." One has to understand that in the material world of duality, to
think that this is good or that this is bad is simply a mental concoction. However, one should not imitate
this consciousness; one should actually be situated on the spiritual platform of neutrality.
