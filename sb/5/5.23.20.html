<h2>Text</h2>
yasya ha vava ksuta-patana-praskhalanadisu vivasah sakrn namabhigrnan purusah karma-bandhanam
anjasa vidhunoti yasya haiva pratibadhanam mumuksavo 'nyathaivopalabhante.

stumbling and so on; vivasah--being helpless; sakrt--once; nama abhigrnan--chanting the holy name of the
Lord; purusah--a person; karma-bandhanam--the bondage of fruitive activity; anjasa--completely;
vidhunoti--washes away; yasya--of which; ha--certainly; eva--in this way; pratibadhanam--the repulsion;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
If one who is embarrassed by hunger or who falls down or stumbles chants the holy name of the Lord
even once, willingly or unwillingly, he is immediately freed from the reactions of his past deeds. Karmis
entangled in material activities face many difficulties in the practice of mystic yoga and other endeavors to
achieve that same freedom.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is not a fact that one has to offer his material possessions to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
be liberated before he can engage in devotional service. A devotee automatically attains liberation without
separate endeavors. Bali Maharaja did not get back all his material possessions merely because of his
charity to the Lord. One who becomes a devotee, free from material desires and motives, regards all
opportunities, both material and spiritual, as benedictions from the Lord, and in this way his service to
the Lord is never hampered. Bhukti, material enjoyment, and mukti, liberation, are only by-products of
devotional service. A devotee need not work separately to attain mukti. Srila Bilvamangala Thakura said,
muktih svayam mukulitanjalih sevate 'sman: a pure devotee of the Lord does not have to endeavor
separately for mukti, because mukti is always ready to serve him.
In this regard, Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 3.177-188) describes Haridasa Thakura's confirmation of the
effect of chanting the holy name of the Lord.
keha bale----'nama haite haya papa-ksaya'
keha bale----'nama haite jivera moksa haya'
Some say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one is freed from all the reactions of sinful life, and
others say that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one attains liberation from material bondage.
haridasa kahena,----"namera ei dui phala naya
namera phale krsna-pade prema upajaya
Haridasa Thakura, however, said that the desired result of chanting the holy name of the Lord is not
that one is liberated from material bondage or freed from the reactions of sinful life. The actual result of
chanting the holy name of the Lord is that one awakens his dormant Krsna consciousness, his loving
service to the Lord.
anusangika phala namera----'mukti', 'papa-nasa'
tahara drstanta yaiche suryera prakasa
Haridasa Thakura said that liberation and freedom from the reactions of sinful activities are only byproducts
of chanting the holy name of the Lord. If one chants the holy name of the Lord purely, he attains
the platform of loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard Haridasa Thakura
gave an example comparing the power of the holy name to sunshine.
ei slokera artha kara panditera gana"
sabe kahe,----'tumi kaha artha-vivarana'
He placed a verse before all the learned scholars present, but the learned scholars asked him to state the
purport of the verse.
haridasa kahena,----"yaiche suryera udaya
udaya na haite arambhe tamera haya ksaya
Haridasa Thakura said that as the sun begins to rise, it dissipates the darkness of night, even before the
sunshine is visible.
caura-preta-raksasadira bhaya haya nasa
udaya haile dharma-karma-adi parakasa
Before the sunrise even takes place, the light of dawn destroys the fear of the dangers of the night, such
as disturbances by thieves, ghosts and Raksasas, and when the sunshine actually appears, one engages in
his duties.
aiche namodayarambhe papa-adira ksaya
udaya kaile krsna-pade haya premodaya
Similarly, even before one's chanting of the holy name is pure, one is freed from all sinful reactions, and
when he chants purely he becomes a lover of Krsna.
'mukti' tuccha-phala haya namabhasa haite
ye mukti bhakta na laya, se krsna cahe dite"
A devotee never accepts mukti, even if Krsna offers it. Mukti, freedom from all sinful reactions, is
obtained even by namabhasa, or a glimpse of the light of the holy name before its full light is perfectly
visible.
The namabhasa stage is between that of nama-aparadha, or chanting of the holy name with offenses, and
pure chanting. There are three stages in chanting the holy name of the Lord. In the first stage, one
commits ten kinds of offenses while chanting. In the next stage, namabhasa, the offenses have almost
stopped, and one is coming to the platform of pure chanting. In the third stage, when one chants the Hare
Krsna mantra without offenses, his dormant love for Krsna immediately awakens. This is the perfection.
