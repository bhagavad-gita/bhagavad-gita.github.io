<h2>Translation</h2>
The next planet below Atala is Vitala, wherein Lord Siva, who is known as the master of gold mines,
lives with his personal associates, the ghosts and similar living entities. Lord Siva, as the progenitor,
engages in sex with Bhavani, the progenitress, to produce living entities, and from the mixture of their
vital fluid the river named Hataki is generated. When fire, being made to blaze by the wind, drinks of this
river and then sizzles and spits it out, it produces gold called Hataka. The demons who live on that planet
with their wives decorate themselves with various ornaments made from that gold, and thus they live
there very happily.
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that when Bhava and Bhavani, Lord Siva and his wife, unite sexually, the emulsification of
their secretions creates a chemical which when heated by fire can produce gold. It is said that the
alchemists of the medieval age tried to prepare gold from base metal, and Srila Sanatana Gosvami also
states that when bell metal is treated with mercury, it can produce gold. Srila Sanatana Gosvami mentions
this in regard to the initiation of low-class men to turn them into brahmanas. Sanatana Gosvami said:
yatha kancanatam yati
kamsyam rasa-vidhanatah
tatha diksa-vidhanena
dvijatvam jayate nrnam
"As one can transform kamsa, or bell metal, into gold by treating it with mercury, one can also turn a
lowborn man into a brahmana by initiating him properly into Vaisnava activities." The International
Society for Krishna Consciousness is trying to turn mlecchas and yavanas into real brahmanas by properly
initiating them and stopping them from engaging in meat-eating, intoxication, illicit sex and gambling.
One who stops these four principles of sinful activity and chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra can
certainly become a pure brahmana through the process of bona fide initiation, as suggested by Srila
Sanatana Gosvami.
Apart from this, if one takes a hint from this verse and learns how to mix mercury with bell metal by
properly heating and melting them, one can get gold very cheaply. The alchemists of the medieval age
tried to manufacture gold, but they were unsuccessful, perhaps because they did not follow the right
instructions.
