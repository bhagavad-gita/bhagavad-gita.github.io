<h2>Translation</h2>
The self-realized brahmana Jada Bharata said: Among the various material combinations and
permutations, there are various forms and earthly transformations. For some reason, these move on the
surface of the earth and are called palanquin carriers. Those material transformations which do not move
are gross material objects like stones. In any case, the material body is made of earth and stone in the form
of feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, torso, throat and head. Upon the shoulders is the wooden palanquin,
and within the palanquin is the so-called King of Sauvira. The body of the King is simply another
transformation of earth, but within that body Your Lordship is situated and falsely thinking that you are
the King of the state of Sauvira.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After analyzing the material bodies of the palanquin carrier and the palanquin passenger, Jada Bharata
concludes that the real living force is the living entity. The living entity is the offshoot or offspring of Lord
Visnu; therefore within this material world, among moving and nonmoving things, the real principle is
Lord Visnu. Due to His presence, everything is working, and there are actions and reactions. One who
understands Lord Visnu as the original cause of everything is to be understood to be perfectly situated in
knowledge. Although he was falsely proud of being a king, King Rahugana was not really situated in
knowledge. Therefore he was rebuking the palanquin carriers, including the self-realized brahmana, Jada
Bharata. This is the first accusation Jada Bharata made against the King, who was daring to talk to a
learned brahmana from the flimsy ground of ignorance, identifying everything with matter. King
Rahugana argued that the living entity is within the body and that when the body is fatigued the living
entity within must therefore be suffering. It is clearly explained in the following verses that the living
entity does not suffer due to the body's fatigue. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti gives an example of a child
heavily decorated with ornaments; although the child's body is very delicate, he does not feel fatigue, nor
do the parents think that his ornaments should be taken away. The living entity has nothing to do with
bodily pains and pleasures. These are simply mental concoctions. An intelligent man will find the original
cause of everything. Material combinations and permutations may be a matter of fact in worldly dealings,
but actually the living force, the soul, has nothing to do with them. Those who are materially upset take
care of the body and manufacture daridra-narayana (poor Narayana). However, it is not a fact that the
soul or Supersoul becomes Door simply because the body is poor. These are the statements of ignorant
people. The soul and Supersoul are always apart from bodily pleasure and pain.
