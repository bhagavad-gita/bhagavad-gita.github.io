<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, the activities of Bharata Maharaja are wonderful. He gave
up everything difficult for others to give up. He gave up his kingdom, his wife and his family. His
opulence was so great that even the demigods envied it, yet he gave it up. It was quite befitting a great
personality like him to be a great devotee. He could renounce everything because he was so attracted to
the beauty, opulence, reputation, knowledge, strength and renunciation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Krsna. Krsna is so attractive that one can give up all desirable things for His sake. Indeed, even
liberation is considered insignificant for those whose minds are attracted to the loving service of the Lord.
PURPORT
This verse confirms Krsna's all-attractiveness. Maharaja Bharata was so attracted to Krsna that he gave
up all his material possessions. Generally materialistic people are attracted by such possessions.
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho 'yam aham mameti
(Bhag. 5.5.8)
"One becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one
increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of 'I and mine.' " The attraction for material things is certainly
due to illusion. There is no value in attraction to material things, for the conditioned soul is diverted by
them. One's life is successful if he is absorbed in the attraction of Krsna's strength, beauty and pastimes as
described in the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The Mayavadis are attracted to merging into the
existence of the Lord, but Krsna is more attractive than the desire to merge. The word abhavah means
"not to take birth again in this material world." A devotee doesn't care whether he is going to be reborn or
not. He is simply satisfied with the Lord's service in any condition. That is real mukti.
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"One who acts to serve Krsna with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person, even
within this material world." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.187) A person who always desires to serve Krsna
is interested in ways to convince people that there is a Supreme personality of Godhead and that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is Krsna. That is his ambition. It doesn't matter whether he is in heaven
or in hell. This is called uttamasloka-lalasa.
