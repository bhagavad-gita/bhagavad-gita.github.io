<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahmanah uvaca--the brahmana Jada Bharata continued to speak; duratyaye--which is very difficult to
traverse; adhvani--on the path of fruitive activities (performing actions in this life, creating a body in the
next life by those actions, and in this way continuously accepting birth and death); ajaya--by maya, the
external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nivesitah--caused to enter; rajah-tamah-sattvavibhakta-
karma-drk--a conditioned soul who sees only immediately beneficial fruitive activities and their
results, which are divided into three groups by the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance; sah--he;
esah--this; sa-arthah--the living entity falsely seeking sense gratification; artha-parah--intent upon gaining
wealth; paribhraman--wandering all over; bhava-atavim--the forest known as bhava, which means the
repetition of birth and death; yati--enters; na--not; sarma--happiness; vindati--obtains.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Jada Bharata, who had fully realized Brahman, continued: My dear King Rahugana, the living entity
wanders on the path of the material world, which is very difficult for him to traverse, and he accepts
repeated birth and death. Being captivated by the material world under the influence of the three modes of
material nature (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna), the living entity can see only the three fruits of
activities under the spell of material nature. These fruits are auspicious, inauspicious and mixed. He thus
becomes attached to religion, economic development, sense gratification and the monistic theory of
liberation (merging with the Supreme). He works very hard day and night exactly like a merchant who
enters a forest to acquire some articles to sell later for profit. However, he cannot really achieve happiness
within this material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One can very easily understand how difficult and insurmountable the path of sense gratification is. Not
knowing what the path of sense gratification is, one becomes implicated in the repetition of birth and
accepts different types of bodies again and again. Thus one suffers in material existence. In this life one
may think that he is very happy being an American, Indian, Englishman or German, but in the next life
one has to accept another body among 8,400,000 species. The next body has to be immediately accepted
according to karma. One will be forced to accept a certain type of body, and protesting will not help. That
is the stringent law of nature. Due to the living entity's ignorance of his eternal blissful life, he becomes
attracted to material activities under the spell of maya. In this world, he can never experience happiness,
yet he works very hard to do so. This is called maya.
