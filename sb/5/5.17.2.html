<h2>Text</h2>
bhadrasravasa ucuh
om namo bhagavate dharmayatma-visodhanaya nama iti.
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhadrasravasah ucuh--the ruler Bhadrasrava and his intimate associates said; om--O Lord; namah--
respectful obeisances; bhagavate--unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; dharmaya--the source of all
religious principles; atma-visodhanaya--who purifies us of material contamination; namah--our
obeisances; iti--thus.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The ruler Bhadrasrava and his intimate associates utter the following prayer: We offer our respectful
obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of all religious principles, who
cleanses the heart of the conditioned soul in this material world. Again and again we offer our respectful
obeisances unto Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Foolish materialistic persons do not know how they are being controlled and punished at every step by
the laws of nature. They think they are very happy in the conditioned state of material life, not knowing
the purpose of repeated birth, death, old age and disease. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (7.15) Lord Krsna
describes such materialistic persons as mudhas (rascals): na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante
naradhamah. These mudhas do not know that if they want to purify themselves, they must worship Lord
Vasudeva (Krsna) by performing penances and austerities. This purification is the aim of human life. This
life is not meant for blind indulgence in sense gratification. In the human form, the living being must
engage himself in Krsna consciousness to purify his existence: tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyet. This is the instruction of King Rsabhadeva to His sons. In the human form of life, one must
undergo all kinds of austerities to purify his existence. Yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam. We are all
seeking happiness, but because of our ignorance and foolishness, we cannot know what unobstructed
happiness really is. Unobstructed happiness is called brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness. Although we
may get some so-called happiness in this material world, that happiness is temporary. The foolish
materialists cannot understand this. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja points out, maya-sukhaya bharam
udvahato vimudhan: merely for temporary materialistic happiness, these rascals are making huge
arrangements, and thus they are baffled life after life.
