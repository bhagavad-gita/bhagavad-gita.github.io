<h2>Translation</h2>
By the arrangement of the Supreme Lord, low-grade living beings like bugs and mosquitoes suck the
blood of human beings and other animals. Such insignificant creatures are unaware that their bites are
painful to the human being. However, first-class human beings--brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas--are
developed in consciousness, and therefore they know how painful it is to be killed. A human being
endowed with knowledge certainly commits sin if he kills or torments insignificant creatures, who have
no discrimination. The Supreme Lord punishes such a man by putting him into the hell known as
Andhakupa, where he is attacked by all the birds and beasts, reptiles, mosquitoes, lice, worms, flies, and
any other creatures he tormented during his life. They attack him from all sides, robbing him of the
pleasure of sleep. Unable to rest, he constantly wanders about in the darkness. Thus in Andhakupa his
suffering is just like that of a creature in the lower species.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this very instructive verse we learn that lower animals, created by the laws of nature to disturb the
human being, are not subjected to punishment. Because the human being has developed consciousness,
however, he cannot do anything against the principles of varnasrama-dharma without being condemned.
Krsna states in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to
the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society
were created by Me." Thus all men should be divided into four classes--brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and
sudras--and they should act according to their ordained regulations. They cannot deviate from their
prescribed rules and regulations. One of these states that they should never trouble any animal, even
those that disturb human beings. Although a tiger is not sinful if he attacks another animal and eats its
flesh, if a man with developed consciousness does so, he must be punished. In other words, a human
being who does not use his developed consciousness but instead acts like an animal surely undergoes
punishment in many different hells.
