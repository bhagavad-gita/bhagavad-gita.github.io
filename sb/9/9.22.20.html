vira-yuthagranir yena
ramo 'pi yudhi tositah
santanor dasa-kanyayam
jajne citrangadah sutah
SYNONYMS
vira-yutha-agranih--Bhismadeva, the foremost of all warriors; yena--by whom; ramah api--even
Parasurama, the incarnation of God; yudhi--in a fight; tositah--was satisfied (when defeated by
Bhismadeva); santanoh--by Santanu; dasa-kanyayam--in the womb of Satyavati, who was known as the

TRANSLATION
Bhismadeva was the foremost of all warriors. When he defeated Lord Parasurama in a fight, Lord
Parasurama was very satisfied with him. By the semen of Santanu in the womb of Satyavati, the daughter
of a fisherman, Citrangada took birth.
PURPORT
Satyavati was actually the daughter of Uparicara Vasu by the womb of a fisherwoman known as
Matsyagarbha. Later, Satyavati was raised by a fisherman.
The fight between Parasurama and Bhismadeva concerns three daughters of Kasiraja--Ambika, Ambalika
and Amba--who were forcibly abducted by Bhismadeva, acting on behalf of his brother Vicitravirya. Amba
thought that Bhismadeva would marry her and became attached to him, but Bhismadeva refused to marry
her, for he had taken the vow of brahmacarya. Amba therefore approached Bhismadeva's military spiritual
master, Parasurama, who instructed Bhisma to marry her. Bhismadeva refused, and therefore Parasurama
fought with him to force him to accept the marriage. But Parasurama was defeated, and he was pleased
with Bhisma.

TRANSLATION
Citrangada, of whom Vicitravirya was the younger brother, was killed by a Gandharva who was also
named Citrangada. Satyavati, before her marriage to Santanu, gave birth to the master authority of the
Vedas, Vyasadeva, known as Krsna Dvaipayana, who was begotten by Parasara Muni. From Vyasadeva, I
[Sukadeva Gosvami] was born, and from him I studied this great work of literature, Srimad-Bhagavatam.
The incarnation of Godhead Vedavyasa, rejecting his disciples, headed by Paila, instructed Srimad-
Bhagavatam to me because I was free from all material desires. After Ambika and Ambalika, the two
daughters of Kasiraja, were taken away by force, Vicitravirya married them, but because he was too
attached to these two wives, he had a heart attack and died of tuberculosis.
