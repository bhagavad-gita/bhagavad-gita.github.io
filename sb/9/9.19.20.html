<h2>Text</h2>
yada na jagrhe raja
bharya-putrav aninditau
srnvatam sarva-bhutanam
khe vag ahasaririni
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; na--not; jagrhe--accepted; raja--the King (Dusmanta); bharya-putrau--his real son and real
wife; aninditau--not abominable, not accused by anyone; srnvatam--while hearing; sarva-bhutanam--all
the people; khe--in the sky; vak--a sound vibration; aha--declared; asaririni--without a body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the King refused to accept his wife and son, who were both irreproachable, an unembodied voice
spoke from the sky as an omen and was heard by everyone present.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Dusmanta knew that Sakuntala and the boy were his own wife and son, but because they came
from outside and were unknown to the citizens, he at first declined to accept them. Sakuntala, however,
was so chaste that an omen from the sky declared the truth so that others could hear. When everyone
heard from the omen that Sakuntala and her child were truly the King's wife and son, the King gladly
accepted them.
