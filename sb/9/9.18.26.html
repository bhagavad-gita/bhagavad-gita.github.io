<h2>Text</h2>
srutva gatham devayani
mene prastobham atmanah
stri-pumsoh sneha-vaiklavyat
parihasam iveritam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
srutva--hearing; gatham--the narration; devayani--Queen Devayani, the wife of Maharaja Yayati; mene--
understood; prastobham atmanah--when instructed for her self-realization; stri-pumsoh--between the
husband and wife; sneha-vaiklavyat--from an exchange of love and affection; parihasam--a funny joke or
story; iva--like; iritam--spoken (by Maharaja Yayati).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Devayani heard Maharaja Yayati's story of the he-goat and she-goat, she understood that this
story, which was presented as if a funny joke for entertainment between husband and wife, was intended
to awaken her to her constitutional position.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his real position as an eternal servant of
Krsna. This is called liberation. Muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih (Bhag. 2.10.6). Under
the influence of maya, everyone living in this material world thinks that he is the master of everything
(ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate). One thinks that there is no God or controller and that one
is independent and can do anything. This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this
ignorance, he is called liberated. Maharaja Yayati had delivered Devayani from the well, and finally, as a
dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her
from the misconception of material happiness. Devayani was quite competent to understand her liberated
husband, and therefore she decided to follow him as his faithful wife.
TEXTS 27-28
<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
sa sannivasam suhrdam
prapayam iva gacchatam
vijnayesvara-tantranam
maya-viracitam prabhoh
sarvatra sangam utsrjya
svapnaupamyena bhargavi
krsne manah samavesya
vyadhunol lingam atmanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa--Devayani; sannivasam--living in the association; suhrdam--of friends and relatives; prapayam--in a
place where water is supplied; iva--like; gacchatam--of tourists on a program for going from one place to
another; vijnaya--understanding; isvara-tantranam--under the influence of the rigid laws of nature; mayaviracitam--
the laws enforced by maya, the illusory energy; prabhoh--of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; sarvatra--everywhere in this material world; sangam--association; utsrjya--giving up; svapnaaupamyena--
by the analogy of a dream; bhargavi--Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya; krsne--unto Lord
Krsna; manah--complete attention; samavesya--fixing; vyadhunot--gave up; lingam--the gross and subtle
bodies; atmanah--of the soul.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya, understood that the materialistic association of
husband, friends and relatives is like the association in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships of society,
friendship and love are created by the maya of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream.
By the grace of Krsna, Devayani gave up her imaginary position in the material world. Completely fixing
her mind upon Krsna, she achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman, Krsna, but
has somehow or other been entrapped by the material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting
of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. One should know that the association of
society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are nothing but creations of maya. One's only
business is to become Krsna conscious and render service unto Krsna as extensively as possible for a
living being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By the grace of Krsna, Devayani attained
this state through the instructions of her husband.
