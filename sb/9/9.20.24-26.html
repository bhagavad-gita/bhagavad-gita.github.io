<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Bharata, the son of Dusmanta, had the mark of Lord Krsna's disc on the palm of his right
hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire
world. Then, under the priesthood of Mamateya, Bhrgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on
the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse
sacrifices on the bank of the Yamuna, beginning from the confluence at Prayaga and ending at the source.
He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brahmanas.
Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brahmanas had one badva [13,084] as his
share.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As indicated here by the words dausmanter agnih saci-gune citah, Bharata, the son of Maharaja
Dusmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the
banks of the Ganges and Yamuna, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed in
very distinguished places. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karmabandhanah:
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this
material world." Everyone should engage in the performance of yajna, and the sacrificial fire should be
ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in
spiritual life. Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were
qualified brahmanas who could perform such yajnas. For the present, however, the Brahma-vaivarta
Purana enjoins:
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau panca vivarjayet
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice,
accepting the order of sannyasa, offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the
wife of one's brother." In this age, such yajnas as the asvamedha-yajna and gomedha-yajna are impossible
to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified brahmanas. This verse says,
mamateyam purodhaya: Maharaja Bharata engaged the son of Mamata, Bhrgu Muni, to take charge of
performing this yajna. Now, however, such brahmanas are impossible to find. Therefore the sastras
recommend, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are intelligent should perform
the sankirtana-yajna inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
"In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is
accompanied by His associates, by performance of sankirtana-yajna." (Bhag. 11.5.32) Yajna must be
performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore
the Krsna consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna all over
the world. This Hare Krsna movement is also yajna, but without the difficulties involved in securing
paraphernalia and qualified brahmanas. This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and
everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajna
will be fulfilled. The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be
any produce (annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna-sambhavah). All our necessities can be produced
simply by rainfall (kamam vavarsa parjanyah), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (sarvakama-
dugha mahi). In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain
from the four principles of sinful life--illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling--and in a pure
state of existence should perform the simple yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Then the
earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically,
socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order.
