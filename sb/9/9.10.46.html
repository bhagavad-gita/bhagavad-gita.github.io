ye viksiptendriya-dhiyo
devas te sva-hrdi sthitam
na vindanti priyam sasvad
atmanam kim utapare
SYNONYMS
ye--which personalities; viksipta-indriya-dhiyah--whose senses, mind and intelligence are always
agitated because of material conditions; devah--like the demigods; te--such persons; sva-hrdi--in the core
of the heart; sthitam--situated; na--not; vindanti--know; priyam--the dearmost Personality of Godhead;
sasvat--constantly, eternally; atmanam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kim uta--what to speak of;
apare--others (like human beings).
TRANSLATION
Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated in the higher planetary system, their
minds, senses and intelligence are agitated by material conditions. Therefore, even such elevated persons
fail to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally situated in the core of the heart. What
then is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer advantages?
PURPORT
It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated in everyone's heart (isvarah sarvabhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this
material world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is situated so near to us. For those
always agitated by material conditions, the yogic process is recommended so that one may concentrate his
mind upon the Supreme personality of Godhead within the heart. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa
pasyanti yam yoginah. Because in material conditions the mind and senses are always agitated, by the
yogic procedures like dharana, asana and dhyana one must quiet the mind and concentrate it upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the
Lord, whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to realize Him. Maharaja
Khatvanga accepted the spiritual path, and therefore he was no longer interested in anything material.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: "Only by devotional service can I be
understood." One can understand Krsna, the Parabrahman, the Supreme personality of Godhead, only
through devotional service. The Lord never says that one can understand Him by performing mystic yoga
or by philosophically speculating. Bhakti is above all such material attempts. Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnanakarmady-
anavrtam. Bhakti is uncontaminated, being unalloyed even by jnana or pious activities.
