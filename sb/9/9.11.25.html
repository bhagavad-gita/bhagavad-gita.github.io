<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami replied: After accepting the throne of the government by the fervent request of His
younger brother Bharata, Lord Ramacandra ordered His younger brothers to go out and conquer the
entire world, while He personally remained in the capital to give audience to all the citizens and residents
of the palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other assistants.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or assistants to be engaged in
sense gratification. The younger brothers of Lord Ramacandra were at home enjoying the personal
presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve
victory all over the world. It was the custom (and this custom, in some places, is still current) that all
other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the emperor. If the king of a small state did not accept
the emperor's supremacy, there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to
accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the country.
Lord Ramacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go out. Many of the Lord's
devotees residing in Vrndavana have taken the vow not to leave Vrndavana to preach Krsna
consciousness. But the Lord says that Krsna consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every
village and every town. This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must not gratify his senses by
remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud, thinking that because he does not leave Vrndavana but
chants in a solitary place he has become a great devotee. A devotee must carry out the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa. Every
devotee, therefore, should spread Krsna consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept
the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam
saranam vraja: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This is the order of the
Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor. Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for this is
victory (dig-vijaya). And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone this
philosophy of life.
Of course, those who are kanistha-adhikaris do not preach, but the Lord shows mercy to them also, as
He did by staying personally in Ayodhya to give audience to the people in general. One should not
mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhya because He especially
favored the citizens. The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each
individual person according to his capacity. One who abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee.
