<h2>Text</h2>
sthalim nyasya vane gatva
grhan adhyayato nisi
tretayam sampravrttayam
manasi trayy avartata
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sthalim--the woman Agnisthali; nyasya--immediately giving up; vane--in the forest; gatva--on returning;
grhan--at home; adhyayatah--began to meditate; nisi--the whole night; tretayam--when the Treta
millennium; sampravrttayam--was just on the point of beginning; manasi--in his mind; trayi--the
principles of the three Vedas; avartata--became revealed.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pururava then left Agnisthali in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon
Urvasi. In the course of his meditation, the Treta millennium began, and therefore the principles of the
three Vedas, including the process of performing yajna to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his
heart.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said, tretayam yajato makhaih: in Treta-yuga, if one performed yajnas, he would get the results of
those yajnas. By performing visnu-yajna specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Of course, yajna is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
While Pururava was meditating upon Urvasi, the Treta-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajnas were
revealed in his heart. But Pururava was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses.
Yajnas for enjoyment of the senses are called karma-kandiya-yajnas. Therefore, he decided to perform
karma-kandiya-yajnas to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, karma-kandiya-yajnas are meant for
sensuous persons, whereas yajna should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the sankirtana-yajna is
recommended. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah. Only those who are very intelligent take
to sankirtana-yajna to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense
enjoyment perform karma-kandiya-yajnas.

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sthali-sthanam--the place where Agnisthali was left; gatah--going there; asvattham--an asvattha tree;

upper one; atmanam--himself; ubhayoh madhye--in between the two; yat tat--that which (he meditated
upon); prajananam--as a son; prabhuh--the King.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the process of fruitive yajna became manifest within his heart, King Pururava went to the same
spot where he had left Agnisthali. There he saw that from the womb of a sami tree, an asvattha tree had
grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two aranis. Desiring to go to the
planet where Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper
one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic fire for performing yajna was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather,
the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by
friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajna. If successful, a yajna will fulfill
the desire of its performer. Thus Pururava took advantage of the process of yajna to fulfill his lusty
desires. He thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son.
A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura is sami-garbhad agnim mantha.
A similar mantra is urvasyam urasi pururavah. Pururava wanted to have children continuously by the
womb of Urvasi. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son. In other words,
he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajna he thought of Urvasi, instead of
thinking of the master of yajna, Yajnesvara, Lord Visnu.
