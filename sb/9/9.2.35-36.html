<h2>Translation</h2>
The son of Krsasva was Somadatta, who performed asvamedha sacrifices and thus satisfied the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu. By worshiping the Supreme Lord, he achieved the most exalted post, a
residence on the planet to which great mystic yogis are elevated. The son of Somadatta was Sumati, whose
son was Janamejaya. All these kings appearing in the dynasty of Visala properly maintained the celebrated
position of King Trnabindu.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu."
Chapter Three
The Marriage of Sukanya and Cyavana Muni
This chapter describes the dynasty of Saryati, another son of Manu, and also tells about Sukanya and
Revati.
Devajna Saryati gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second
day of the yajna of the Angirasas. One day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to
the asrama of Cyavana Muni. There Sukanya saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms,
and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances. As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze
from that hole. Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from constipation and inability
to pass urine. When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya
was the cause of this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him
according to his own desire, and Devajna Saryati offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very
old man.
When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the muni
requested them to give him back his youth. These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake,
in which they bathed and regained full youth. After this, Sukanya could not distinguish her husband. She
then surrendered unto the Asvini-kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore
introduced her again to her husband. Cyavana Muni then engaged King Saryati in performing the somayajna
and gave the Asvini-kumaras the privilege to drink soma-rasa. The King of heaven, Lord Indra,
became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati. Henceforward, the Asvini-kumara
physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.
Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and Bhurisena. Anarta had one son, whose
name was Revata. Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi. Kakudmi was advised
by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who belongs to the visnu-tattva
category. After doing this, Kakudmi retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to
execute austerities and penances.
