<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Hariscandra first purified his mind, which was full of material enjoyment, by amalgamating it
with the earth. Then he amalgamated the earth with water, the water with fire, the fire with the air, and
the air with the sky. Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total
material energy with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization of one's self as part of the
Supreme Lord. When the self-realized spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally
imperceptible and inconceivable. Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from
material bondage.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Descendants of King Mandhata."
Chapter Eight
The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva
In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described. In the dynasty of Rohita there was a
king named Sagara, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of
Sagara.
The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township
known as Campapuri. The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was
Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka. Bahuka, the son of Vrka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies,
and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest. When he died there, his wife wanted to
accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva
found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her
poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison. The son was therefore named Sagara (sa
means "with," and gara means "poison"). Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara
reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras. The king did not kill them,
but reformed them. Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha
sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven. King Sagara
had two wives, named Sumati and Kesini. While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively
dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sagara
Ocean. In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to
have stolen the horse. With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes.
Kesini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamanjasa, whose son Amsuman later searched
for the horse and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Amsuman saw both the horse
meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes. Amsuman offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by
his prayers and who returned the horse. After getting back the horse, however, Amsuman still stood
before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Amsuman was praying for the deliverance of his
forefathers. Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the
Ganges. Amsuman then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that
place with the horse for sacrifice. When King Sagara finished his yajna, he handed over the kingdom to
Amsuman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation.
