tasmad etam aham tyaktva
brahmany adhyaya manasam
nirdvandvo nirahankaras
carisyami mrgaih saha
SYNONYMS
tasmat--therefore; etam--such strong desires for lusty affairs; aham--I; tyaktva--giving up; brahmani--
upon the Supreme Absolute Truth; adhyaya--fixing; manasam--the mind; nirdvandvah--without duality;
nirahankarah--without an identity of false prestige; carisyami--I shall loiter or wander in the forest;
mrgaih saha--with the forest animals.
TRANSLATION
Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Free from the dualities of mental concoction and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with
the animals.
PURPORT
To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one's
mind cannot be freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed
from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the
forest. pancasordhvam vanam vrajet. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and
go to the forest. The best forest is Vrndavana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves Vrndavana. Cultivating Krsna consciousness
in Vrndavana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in Vrndavana one can
automatically meditate upon Krsna. Vrndavana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples
one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Radha-Krsna or Krsna-Balarama and meditate upon this
form. As expressed here by the words brahmany adhyaya, one should concentrate one's mind upon the
Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Krsna, as confirmed by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita
(param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan). Krsna and His abode, Vrndavana, are not
different. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, aradhyo bhagavan vrajesa-tanayas tad-dhama vrndavanam.
Vrndavana is as good as Krsna. Therefore, if one somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in
Vrndavana, and if one is not a pretender but simply lives in Vrndavana and concentrates his mind upon
Krsna, one is liberated from material bondage. One's mind is not purified, however, even in Vrndavana, if
one is agitated by lusty desires. One should not live in Vrndavana and commit offenses, for a life of
offenses in Vrndavana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs
live in Vrndavana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires. Men who have gone to Vrndavana
but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave Vrndavana and stop their grievous offenses at the
lotus feet of the Lord. There are many misguided men who live in Vrndavana to satisfy their sexual
desires, but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are under the control of
maya, and specifically under the control of lusty desires, are called maya-mrga. Indeed, everyone in the
conditional stage of material life is a maya-mrga. It is said, maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad: Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa to show His causeless mercy to the maya-mrgas, the people of this
material world, who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and always think of Krsna in full Krsna consciousness. Then one will be eligible to live in
Vrndavana, and his life will be successful.
