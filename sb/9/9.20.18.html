<h2>Text</h2>
tat-prasanganubhavena
rantidevanuvartinah
abhavan yoginah sarve
narayana-parayanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat-prasanga-anubhavena--because of associating with King Rantideva (when talking with him about
bhakti-yoga); rantideva-anuvartinah--the followers of King Rantideva (that is, his servants, his family
members, his friends and others); abhavan--became; yoginah--first-class mystic yogis, or bhakti-yogis;
sarve--all of them; narayana-parayanah--devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were totally favored by his mercy and became
pure devotees, attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Thus they all became the best
of yogis.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The best yogis or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." The best yogi is he who
constantly thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the core of the heart. Because Rantideva
was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Narayana, by the king's transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure
devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said that a Vaisnava is meritorious in proportion to the number of
devotees he has created. A Vaisnava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number
of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word rantidevanuvartinah indicates that Rantideva's
officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaisnavas by his association. In other words,
Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or maha-bhagavata. Mahat-sevam dvaram ahur
vimukteh: one should render service to such mahatmas, for then one will automatically achieve the goal
of liberation. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has also said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: one
cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaisnava, the door to
liberation is open.

came from him a generation of brahmanas. From Mahavirya came a son named Duritaksaya, whose sons
were Trayyaruni, Kavi and Puskararuni. Although these sons of Duritaksaya took birth in a dynasty of
ksatriyas, they too attained the position of brahmanas. Brhatksatra had a son named Hasti, who
established the city of Hastinapura [now New Delhi].
