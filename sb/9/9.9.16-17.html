<h2>Translation</h2>
Bhagiratha had a son named Sruta, whose son was Nabha. This son was different from the Nabha
previously described. Nabha had a son named Sindhudvipa, from Sindhudvipa came Ayutayu, and from
Ayutayu came Rtuparna, who became a friend of Nalaraja. Rtuparna taught Nalaraja the art of gambling,
and Nalaraja gave Rtuparna lessons in controlling and maintaining horses. The son of Rtuparna was
Sarvakama.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Gambling is also an art. Ksatriyas are allowed to exhibit talent in this art of gambling. By the grace of
Krsna, the Pandavas lost everything by gambling and were deprived of their kingdom, wife, family and
home because they were not expert in the gambling art. In other words, a devotee may not be expert in
materialistic activities. It is therefore advised in the sastra that materialistic activities are not at all suitable
for the living entities, especially the devotees. A devotee should therefore be satisfied to eat whatever is
sent as prasada by the Supreme Lord. A devotee remains pure because he does not take to sinful activities
such as gambling, intoxication, meat-eating and illicit sex.
