<h2>Text</h2>
aksauhininam patibhir
asurair nrpa-lanchanaih
bhuva akramyamanaya
abharaya krtodyamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aksauhininam--of kings possessing great military power; patibhih--by such kings or government;
asuraih--actually demons (because they do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily);
nrpa-lanchanaih--who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have somehow taken possession of the
government); bhuvah--on the surface of the earth; akramyamanayah--aiming at attacking one another;
abharaya--paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on the surface of the earth; krtaudyamah--
enthusiastic (they spend all the revenue of the state to increase military power).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they
do not know the duty of the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who
possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the
surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so
that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Krsna
consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam. The sadhus, the devotees
of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Krsna consciousness so that the conditioned souls
may be released from the bondage of birth and death. But the asuras, the demons, impede the
advancement of the Krsna consciousness movement, and therefore Krsna arranges occasional fights
between different asuras who are very much interested in increasing their military power. The duty of the
government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to
see that the people of the state advance in Krsna consciousness. For this purpose, Krsna says in Bhagavadgita
(4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to the three modes of
material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me."
There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide brahmanas, and they should be given all
protection. Namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca. Krsna is very fond of brahmanas and cows,
The brahmanas promulgate the cause of advancement in Krsna consciousness, and the cows give enough
milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness. The ksatriyas and the government should be advised
by the brahmanas. Next, the vaisyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the sudras, who cannot do
anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls
will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of
Krsna's descent on the surface of the earth (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam).
Everyone must understand Krsna's activities (janma karma ca me divyam). If one understands the
purpose of Krsna's coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This
liberation is the purpose of the creation and Krsna's descent upon the surface of the earth. Demons are
very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but
Krsna's devotees want to teach Krsna consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and
Krsna conscious advancement. Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so
that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization. Such endeavors
are jagato'hitah; that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general. Ksayaya: such activities
lead to annihilation. One who understands the purpose of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
should seriously understand the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement and seriously take part
in it. One should not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense gratification. Nunam
pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti (Bhag. 5.5.4). Simply for sense gratification, people
make plans for material happiness. Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag. 7.9.43). They do
this because they are all vimudhas, rascals. For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy,
not understanding the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple
devotees of brainwashing. Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Krsna consciousness
movement, but Krsna will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be
engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.
