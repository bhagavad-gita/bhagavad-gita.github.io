<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
sukanya cyavanam prapya
patim parama-kopanam
prinayam asa citta-jna
apramattanuvrttibhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sukanya--the girl named Sukanya, the daughter of King Saryati; cyavanam--the great sage Cyavana
Muni; prapya--after obtaining; patim--as her husband; parama-kopanam--who was always very angry;
prinayam asa--she satisfied him; citta-jna--understanding the mind of her husband; apramatta
anuvrttibhih--by executing services without being bewildered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanya had gotten him as her husband, she dealt with him
carefully, according to his mood. Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without being
bewildered.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A great personality like Cyavana
Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to
anyone. Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife, Sukanya, could understand his
attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her
husband, she must try to understand her husband's temperament and please him. This is victory for a
woman. Even in the dealings of Lord Krsna with His different queens, it has been seen that although the
queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Krsna as His maidservants.
However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she
must be ready to carry out her husband's orders and please him in all circumstances. Then her life will be
successful. When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or
ultimately completely broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is
broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws.
According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be
trained to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for
the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband,
however irritable or cruel he may be. In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not
young but indeed old enough to be Sukanya's grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanya, the
beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all
respects. Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.
