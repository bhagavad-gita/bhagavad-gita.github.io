<h2>Text</h2>
etav uranakau rajan
nyasau raksasva manada
samramsye bhavata sakam
slaghyah strinam varah smrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etau--to these two; uranakau--lambs; rajan--O King Pururava; nyasau--who have fallen down; raksasva--
please give protection; mana-da--O one who gives all honor to a guest or visitor; samramsye--I shall enjoy
sexual union; bhavata sakam--in your company; slaghyah--superior; strinam--of a woman; varah--
husband; smrtah--it is said.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Pururava, please give protection to these two lambs, who have fallen down with me.
Although I belong to the heavenly planets and you belong to earth, I shall certainly enjoy sexual union
with you. I have no objection to accepting you as my husband, for you are superior in every respect.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.40), yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesavasudhadi-
vibhuti-bhinnam. There are various planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The
atmosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvasi descended after being cursed by Mitra and Varuna
was different from the atmosphere of this earth. Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are
certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvasi agreed to remain the consort of
Pururava, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds a man with superior
qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an
inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Sri Canakya
Pandita (stri-ratnam duskulad api). The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities of
both are on an equal level.
