<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Nimi continued: Mayavadis generally want freedom from accepting a material body because
they fear having to give it up again. But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the
Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a cause of bondage; because he
was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he could render devotional service to the Lord. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings:
janmaobi more iccha yadi tora
bhakta-grhe jani janma ha-u mora
kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya dasa
"My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again, kindly do me this favor: allow
me to take birth in the home of Your servant, Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an
insignificant creature like an insect." Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagadisa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaitukyi tvayi
"O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or
fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service
to You." (Siksastaka 4) By saying "life after life" (janmani janmani), the Lord referred not to an ordinary
birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body is desirable. A devotee does
not think like yogis and jnanis, who want to refuse a material body and become one with the impersonal
Brahman effulgence. A devotee does not like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body, material
or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation.
If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material body, there is no cause of
anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a liberated soul. This is confirmed by Srila Rupa
Gosvami:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krsna) with his body,
mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be
engaged in many so-called material activities." The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in
any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body. In a spiritual body the devotee
becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a
material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee
in Vaikunthaloka. There is no distinction. It is said, sadhur jivo va maro va. Whether a devotee is alive or
dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti. When he gives up
his body, he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same
thing even in a material body in the material world.
For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One may argue that at the time of death a
devotee also suffers because of giving up his material body. But in this connection the example may be
given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth. Both the mouse and the
kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten.
When a devotee gives up his body (tyaktva deham), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead. Thus
his perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by Yamaraja for punishment. A
person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a
material body, whereas a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much
afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we should follow the
instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. It
doesn't matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should be to
serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
