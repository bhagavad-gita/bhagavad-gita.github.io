<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Ambarisa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Krsna, his words in
describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the
words spoken by Krsna or about Krsna. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Krsna, Krsna's temples
and Krsna's places like Mathura and Vrndavana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of
the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasi offered to the Lord,
and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasada. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places
and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord,
twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Maharaja Ambarisa never desired anything for his own sense
gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord.
This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy asakta-manah partha yogam yunjan mad-asrayah.
This indicates that one must execute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under
the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible, however, to train oneself without
guidance from the spiritual master. Therefore, according to the instructions of Srila Rupa Gosvami, the
first business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various
senses in rendering transcendental service to the Lord. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1),
asamsayam samagram mam yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu. In other words, if one wants to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by Krsna by
following in the footsteps of Maharaja Ambarisa. It is said, hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate:
bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Krsna, who is called Hrsikesa
or Acyuta. These words are used in these verses. Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, hrsikesa-padabhivandane. The
words Acyuta and Hrsikesa are also used in Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita is krsna-katha spoken directly
by Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is also krsna-katha because everything described in the Bhagavatam is
in relationship with Krsna.
