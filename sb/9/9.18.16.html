<h2>Text</h2>
ya dustyaja durmatibhir
jiryato ya na jiryate
tam trsnam duhkha-nivaham
sarma-kamo drutam tyajet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ya--that which; dustyaja--extremely difficult to give up; durmatibhih--by persons too attached to
material enjoyment; jiryatah--even by one who is an invalid because of old age; ya--that which; na--not;
jiryate--is vanquished; tam--such; trsnam--desire; duhkha-nivaham--which is the cause of all tribulations;
sarma-kamah--a person desiring his own happiness; drutam--very soon; tyajet--should give up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For those who are too attached to material enjoyment, sense gratification is very difficult to give up.
Even when one is an invalid because of old age, one cannot give up such desires for sense gratification.
Therefore, one who actually desires happiness must give up such unsatisfied desires, which are the cause
of all tribulations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men who have reached more than
eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and pay heavy fees to drink wine and associate with women.
Although such men are too old to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased. Time deteriorates even
the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and
invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the desires of his
senses. Therefore, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, one should give up his lusty desires. As explained by Sri
Yamunacarya:
yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatam rantum asit
tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikarah susthu-nisthivanam ca
When one is Krsna conscious, he gets more and more happiness by discharging duties for Krsna. Such a
person spits on sense gratification, especially that of sexual enjoyment. An experienced, advanced devotee
is no longer interested in sex life. The strong desire for sex can be subdued only by advancement in Krsna
consciousness.
