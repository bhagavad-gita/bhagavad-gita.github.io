<h2>Text</h2>
yat tad brahma param suksmam
asunyam sunya-kalpitam
bhagavan vasudeveti
yam grnanti hi satvatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--that which; tat--such; brahma param--Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna;
suksmam--spiritual, beyond all material conceptions; asunyam--not impersonal or void; sunya-kalpitam--
imagined to be void by less intelligent men; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vasudeva--
Krsna; iti--thus; yam--whom; grnanti--sing about; hi--indeed; satvatah--pure devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, Krsna, is extremely difficult to understand for
unintelligent men who accept Him as impersonal or void, which He is not. The Lord is therefore
understood and sung about by pure devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases--as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan is the
origin of everything. Brahman is a partial representation of Bhagavan, and Vasudeva, the Supersoul living
everywhere and in everyone's heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. But when one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vasudevah samam
iti), when one realizes that Vasudeva is both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in
perfect knowledge. Krsna is therefore described by Arjuna as param brahma param dhama pavitram
paramam bhavan. The words param brahma refer to the shelter of the impersonal Brahman and also of the
all-pervading Supersoul. When Krsna says tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti, this means that the
perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead. Maharaja Khatvanga accepted
the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved
perfection.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Amsuman."
Chapter Ten
The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Ramacandra
This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra appeared in the dynasty of Maharaja Khatvanga. It
also describes the Lord's activities, telling how He killed Ravana and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of
His kingdom.
The son of Maharaja Khatvanga was Dirghabahu, and his son was Raghu. The son of Raghu was Aja, the
son of Aja was Dasaratha, and the son of Dasaratha was Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion--as Lord
Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna--great sages like Valmiki who were actually in knowledge
of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes these
pastimes in brief.
Lord Ramacandra went with Visvamitra and killed Raksasas like Marica. After breaking the stout and
strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sita and cut down the prestige of Parasurama.
To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Laksmana and Sita. There He cut
off the nose of Surpanakha and killed the associates of Ravana, headed by Khara and Dusana. Ravana's
kidnapping of Sitadevi was the beginning of this demon's misfortune. When Marica assumed the form of a
golden deer, Lord Ramacandra went to bring the deer to please Sitadevi, but in the meantime Ravana took
advantage of the Lord's absence to kidnap her. When Sitadevi was kidnapped, Lord Ramacandra,
accompanied by Laksmana, searched for her throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met
Jatayu. Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vali and established a friendly
relationship with Sugriva. After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to
the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra
did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry. Then Samudra came to the Lord with great
haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to bridge the
ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhisana, He attacked Ravana's capital, Lanka. Previously,
Hanuman, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Lanka, and now, with the help of Laksmana, the
forces of Lord Ramacandra killed all the Raksasa soldiers. Then Lord Ramacandra personally killed
Ravana. Mandodari and other wives lamented for Ravana, and in accordance with Lord Ramacandra's
order, Vibhisana performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family. Lord Ramacandra then
gave Vibhisana the right to rule Lanka and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered
Sitadevi from the Asoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhya, where He was
received by His brother Bharata. When Lord Ramacandra entered Ayodhya, Bharata brought His wooden
shoes, Vibhisana and Sugriva held a whisk and fan, Hanuman carried an umbrella, Satrughna carried the
Lord's bow and two quivers, and Sitadevi carried a waterpot containing water from holy places. Angada
carried a sword, and Jambavan (Rksaraja) carried a shield. After Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Lord
Laksmana and mother Sitadevi, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasistha enthroned Him as King. The
chapter ends with a short description of Lord Ramacandra's rule in Ayodhya.
