TRANSLATION
After thus rebuking Ravana, Lord Ramacandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at Ravana, and released
the arrow, which pierced Ravana's heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Ravana's followers raised a
tumultuous sound, crying, "Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?" as Ravana, vomiting
blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly
planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.21) it is said, ksine punye martya-lokam visanti: "When the results of their pious
activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth." The fruitive
activities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain
within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can
relieve one from maya's clutches of repeated birth and death. Somehow or other, Ravana was raised to an
exalted position as the king of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of
kidnapping mother Sita, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If one offends an exalted
personality, especially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable;
bereft of the results of pious activities, one must fall down like Ravana and other demons. It is therefore
advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the pure state of freedom from
all designations (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam). When one is fixed in devotional
service, he is above the material platform. On the material platform there are higher and lower positions,
but when one is above the material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). Ravana or those like him may be very powerful and opulent in
this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of
their karma (karmana daiva-netrena). We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws
of nature.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27) One should not be proud of
one's exalted position and act like Ravana, thinking oneself independent of material nature's laws.
