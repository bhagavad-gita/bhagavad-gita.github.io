<h2>Translation</h2>
While Maharaja Santanu was on a hunting excursion, he saw the male and female children lying in the
forest, and out of compassion he took them home. Consequently, the male child was known as Krpa, and
the female child was named Krpi. Krpi later became the wife of Dronacarya.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Bharata."
Chapter Twenty-two
The Descendants of Ajamidha
This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa. It also describes Jarasandha, who belonged to the
Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.
The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after another--Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and
Somaka. Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada was
born. Drupada's daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed by Dhrstadyumna. Dhrstadyumna's
son was Dhrstaketu.
Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa. From Rksa came a son named Samvarana, and from
Samvarana came Kuru, the king of Kuruksetra. Kuru had four sons--Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.
Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu.
The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings
of the Cedi state. In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kusagra, Rsabha, Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu,
and from Brhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva,
Somapi and Srutasrava. Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons. Among the descendants of Jahnu were
Suratha, Viduratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena, Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Rksa, Dilipa and
Pratipa.
The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika. When Devapi retired to the forest, his younger
brother Santanu became the king. Although Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the
throne, he disregarded his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years. Following
the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready to return the kingdom to Devapi, but by the intrigue of
Santanu's minister, Devapi became unfit to be king. Therefore Santanu resumed charge of the kingdom,
and rain fell properly during his regime. By mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as
Kalapa-grama. In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vamsa (the lunar
dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The
wife of Santanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities. Two sons named
Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and
Vyasadeva was born from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara, Vyasadeva instructed the history of the
Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva. Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya,
Vyasadeva begot Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.
Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duhsala. Pandu
had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi. The names
of these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti, Satanika and Srutakarma. Besides these
five sons, by other wives the Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata,
Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. From Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was
born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four sons--Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.
Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu family. From Janamejaya, he said,
would come a son named Satanika, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Asvamedhaja,
Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstiman, Susena, Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava,
Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpanjaya, Durva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satanika, Durdamana, Mahinara,
Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.
Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-vamsa, or Magadha dynasty. Sahadeva, the
son of Jarasandha, would beget Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava. Subsequently taking birth
in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena, Karmajit, Sutanjaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema,
Suvrata, Dharmasutra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripunjaya.
