<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tam sasapa kulacaryah
krtagasam akamatah
na ksatra-bandhuh sudras tvam
karmana bhavitamuna
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him (Prsadhra); sasapa--cursed; kula-acaryah--the family priest, Vasistha; krta-agasam--because of
committing the great sin of killing a cow; akamatah--although he did not want to do it; na--not; ksatrabandhuh--
the family member of a ksatriya; sudrah tvam--you have behaved like a sudra; karmana--
therefore by your fruitive reaction; bhavita--you shall become a sudra; amuna--because of killing the cow.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although Prsadhra had committed the sin unknowingly, his family priest, Vasistha, cursed him, saying,
"In your next life you shall not be able to become a ksatriya. Instead, you shall take birth as a sudra
because of killing the cow."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that Vasistha was not free from tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance. As the family priest or
spiritual master of Prsadhra, Vasistha should have taken Prsadhra's offense very lightly, but instead
Vasistha cursed him to become a sudra. It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give
him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement. Vasistha, however, did just the opposite.
Therefore Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that he was durmati; in other words, his intelligence
was not very good.
