meeting; mama--with me; na--not; brahmanah--a qualified brahmana; me--my; bhavita--will become;

TRANSLATION
Because of falling in the well, I met you. Indeed, this has been arranged by providence. After I cursed
Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Brhaspati, he cursed me by saying that I would not have a brahmana
for a husband. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife of a
brahmana.
PURPORT
Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Brhaspati, had been a student of Sukracarya, from whom he
had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely. This art, called mrta-sanjivani, was
especially used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a
soldier's body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of mrta-sanjivani. This art was
known to Sukracarya and many others, and Kaca, the son of Brhaspati, became Sukracarya's student to
learn it. Devayani desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Sukracarya, looked
upon the guru's daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devayani angrily
cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of mrta-sanjivani from her father, it would be
useless. When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayani never to have a husband who was a
brahmana. Because Devayani liked Yayati, who was a ksatriya, she requested him to accept her as his bona
fide wife. Although this would be pratiloma-vivaha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and
the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence.
