<h2>Text</h2>
striyo hy akarunah krura
durmarsah priya-sahasah
ghnanty alparthe 'pi visrabdham
patim bhrataram apy uta
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
striyah--women; hi--indeed; akarunah--merciless; krurah--cunning; durmarsah--intolerant; priyasahasah--
for their own pleasure they can do anything; ghnanti--they kill; alpa-arthe--for a slight reason;
api--indeed; visrabdham--faithful; patim--husband; bhrataram--brother; api--also; uta--it is said.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Women as a class are merciless and cunning. They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. For their own
pleasure they can do anything irreligious, and therefore they do not fear killing even a faithful husband or
brother.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Pururava was greatly attached to Urvasi. Yet despite his faithfulness to her, she had left him. Now,
considering that the King was wasting his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvasi frankly explained the
nature of a woman. Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her
husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required. To say nothing of her husband, she can
even kill her brother. That is a woman's nature. Therefore, in the material world, unless women are
trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in society.
