<h2>Translation</h2>
When the process of fruitive yajna became manifest within his heart, King Pururava went to the same
spot where he had left Agnisthali. There he saw that from the womb of a sami tree, an asvattha tree had
grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two aranis. Desiring to go to the
planet where Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper
one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic fire for performing yajna was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather,
the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by
friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajna. If successful, a yajna will fulfill
the desire of its performer. Thus Pururava took advantage of the process of yajna to fulfill his lusty
desires. He thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son.
A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura is sami-garbhad agnim mantha.
A similar mantra is urvasyam urasi pururavah. Pururava wanted to have children continuously by the
womb of Urvasi. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son. In other words,
he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajna he thought of Urvasi, instead of
thinking of the master of yajna, Yajnesvara, Lord Visnu.
