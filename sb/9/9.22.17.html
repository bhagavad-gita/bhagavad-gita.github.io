<h2>Purport</h2>
As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." The majority of transcendentalists understand only the impersonal Brahman or
localized Paramatma, for the Personality of Godhead is very difficult to understand. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." The yogis and jnanis--that is, the mystic yogis and the
impersonalists--can understand the Absolute Truth as impersonal or localized, but although such realized
souls are above ordinary human beings, they cannot understand how the Supreme Absolute Truth can be
a person. Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas, the souls who have already realized the Absolute
Truth, one may understand Krsna, who exactly resembles a human being (narakrti). This human form
was explained by Krsna Himself after He manifested the virat-rupa. The virat-rupa is not the original form
of the Lord; the Lord's original form is Dvibhuja-syamasundara, Muralidhara, the Lord with two hands,
playing a flute (yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam). The Lord's forms are proof of His
inconceivable qualities. Although the Lord maintains innumerable universes within the period of His
breath, He is dressed with a form exactly like that of a human being. That does not mean, however, that
He is a human being. This is His original form, but because He looks like a human being, those with a
poor fund of knowledge consider Him an ordinary man. The Lord says:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be." (Bg. 9.11) By the Lord's param bhavam, or transcendental nature,
He is the all-pervading Paramatma living in the core of the hearts of all living entities, yet He looks like a
human being. Mayavada philosophy says that the Lord is originally impersonal but assumes a human
form and many other forms when He descends. Actually, however, He is originally like a human being,
and the impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti).
