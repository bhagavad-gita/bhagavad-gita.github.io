Chapter Six
The Downfall of Saubhari Muni
After describing the descendants of Maharaja Ambarisa, Sukadeva Gosvami described all the kings from
Sasada to Mandhata, and in this connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the
daughters of Mandhata.
Maharaja Ambarisa had three sons, named Virupa, Ketuman and Sambhu. The son of Virupa was
Prsadasva, and his son was Rathitara. Rathitara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great
sage Angira, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathitara's wife. When the sons were born, they
became the dynasty of Angira Rsi and of Rathitara.
The son of Manu was Iksvaku, who had one hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were
the eldest. The sons of Maharaja Iksvaku became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violating
sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikuksi, was banished from the kingdom. By the mercy
of Vasistha and the power of mystic yoga, Maharaja Iksvaku attained liberation after giving up his material
body. When Maharaja Iksvaku expired, his son Vikuksi returned and took charge of the kingdom. He
performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
Vikuksi later became celebrated as Sasada.
Vikuksi's son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and because of his valuable service
he became famous as Puranjaya, Indravaha and Kakutstha. The son of Puranjaya was Anena, the son of
Anena was Prthu, and the son of Prthu was Visvagandhi. The son of Visvagandhi was Candra, the son of
Candra was Yuvanasva, and his son was Sravasta, who constructed Sravasti Puri. The son of Sravasta was
Brhadasva. Brhadasva's son Kuvalayasva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated
as Dhundhumara, "the killer of Dhundhu." The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Drdhasva, Kapilasva
and Bhadrasva. He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from
Dhundhu. The son of Drdhasva was Haryasva, the son of Haryasva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha
was Bahulasva, and the son of Bahulasva was Krsasva. The son of Krsasva was Senajit, and his son was
Yuvanasva.
Yuvanasva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest. In the
forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajna on his behalf. Once, however, the King
became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajna. Consequently, after
some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was
crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck. Thus the son became
known as Mandhata. In due course of time, Yuvanasva achieved perfection by performing austerities.
Thereafter, Mandhata became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands. Thieves
and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as
Trasaddasyu, meaning "one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves." Mandhata begot sons in the womb
of his wife, Bindumati. These sons were Purukutsa, Ambarisa and Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty
sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.
In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual
agitation caused by fish, fell from his yoga and wanted to marry all the daughters of Mandhata for sexual
pleasure. Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of vanaprastha,
performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami
described how Saubhari Muni's wives also became perfect.
