tasya uddharanopayam
bastah kami vicintayan
vyadhatta tirtham uddhrtya
visanagrena rodhasi
SYNONYMS
tasyah--of the she-goat; uddharana-upayam--the means of deliverance (from the well); bastah--the hegoat;
kami--having lusty desires; vicintayan--planning; vyadhatta--executed; tirtham--a way to come out;
uddhrtya--digging the earth; visana-agrena--by the point of the horns; rodhasi--at the edge of the well.
TRANSLATION
After planning how to get the she-goat out of the well, the lusty he-goat dug up the earth on the well's
edge with the point of his horns in such a way that she was able to come out very easily.
PURPORT
Attraction for woman is the impetus for economic development, housing and many other things meant
for living comfortably in this material world. Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was
a laborious task, but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent this labor. Aho grha-ksetrasutapta-
vittair janasya moho 'yam aham mameti. The union between male and female provides the
impetus for gaining a nice apartment, a good income, children and friends. Thus one becomes entangled
in this material world.

he-goat as their husband; pivanam--very stout and strong; smasrulam--having a very nice mustache and
beard; prestham--first-class; midhvamsam--expert in discharging semen; yabha-kovidam--expert in the art
of sexual intercourse; sah--that he-goat; ekah--alone; aja-vrsah--the hero of the goats; tasam--of all the
she-goats; bahvinam--a great number; rati-vardhanah--could increase the lusty desire; reme--he enjoyed;
kama-graha-grastah--being haunted by the ghost of lusty desire; atmanam--his own self; na--not;
avabudhyata--could understand.
TRANSLATION
When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she
desired to accept him as her husband. When she did so, many other she-goats also desired him as their
husband because he had a very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert
in discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost
exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities
and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.
PURPORT
Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham
hi tuccham. Although one becomes a grhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart's content, one
is never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get
the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for selfrealization.
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam
Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (dehino 'smin yatha
dehe). A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body.
However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from
bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist
haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily
concept of life.
