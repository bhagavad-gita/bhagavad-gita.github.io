<h2>Text</h2>
durmana bhagavan kavyah
paurohityam vigarhayan
stuvan vrttim ca kapotim
duhitra sa yayau purat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
durmanah--being very unhappy; bhagavan--the most powerful; kavyah--Sukracarya; paurohityam--the
business of priesthood; vigarhayan--condemning; stuvan--praising; vrttim--the profession; ca--and;
kapotim--of collecting grains from the field; duhitra--with his daughter; sah--he (Sukracarya); yayau--
went; purat--from his own residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As Sukracarya listened to what had happened to Devayani, his mind was very much aggrieved.
Condemning the profession of priesthood and praising the profession of uncha-vrtti [collecting grains
from the fields], he left home with his daughter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a brahmana adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the
field. This is called uncha-vrtti. A brahmana who takes to this uncha-vrtti profession is called first class
because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg
from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a brahmana or sannyasi, one does better if
he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead for maintenance. Sukracarya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter's complaint he
had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the
profession of priesthood. In his heart, Sukracarya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it,
he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.
