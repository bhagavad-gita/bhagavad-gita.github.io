<h2>Text</h2>
aho rupam aho bhavo
nara-loka-vimohanam
ko na seveta manujo
devim tvam svayam agatam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--wonderful; rupam--beauty; aho--wonderful; bhavah--postures; nara-loka--in human society or on
the planet earth; vimohanam--so attractive; kah--who; na--not; seveta--can accept; manujah--among
human beings; devim--a demigoddess; tvam--like you; svayam agatam--who has personally arrived.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Pururava replied: O beautiful one, your beauty is wonderful and your gestures are also wonderful.
Indeed, you are attractive to all human society. Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from
the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears from the words of Urvasi that the standard of living, eating, behavior and speech are all
different on the heavenly planets from the standards on this planet earth. The inhabitants of the heavenly
planets do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared in clarified
butter. Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse. To
live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress
half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked. Indeed, there are many clubs and
societies for this purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets. The inhabitants
of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well
behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness. These are some of the distinctions
between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the inhabitants of earth.
