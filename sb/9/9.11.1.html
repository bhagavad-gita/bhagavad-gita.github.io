<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
bhagavan atmanatmanam
rama uttama-kalpakaih
sarva-devamayam devam
ije 'thacaryavan makhaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; atmana--
by Himself; atmanam--Himself; ramah--Lord Ramacandra; uttama-kalpakaih--with very opulent
paraphernalia; sarva-deva-mayam--the heart and soul of all the demigods; devam--the Supreme Lord
Himself; ije--worshiped; atha--thus; acaryavan--under the guidance of an acarya; makhaih--by performing
sacrifices.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thereafter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ramacandra, accepted
an acarya and performed sacrifices [yajnas] with opulent paraphernalia. Thus He Himself worshiped
Himself, for He is the Supreme Lord of all demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sarvarhanam acyutejya. If Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, then everyone is
worshiped. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.31.14):
yatha taror mula-nisecanena
trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah
pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam
tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya
"As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as
supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality." Performing
yajna involves worshiping the Supreme Lord. Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord.
Therefore it is said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself. This does not,
of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The jiva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The living entities
(vibhinnamsa) never become one with the Lord, although Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord's
worship of Himself. Lord Krsna meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord
Ramacandra performed yajnas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being
should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahangraha-upasana. Such unauthorized worship is not
recommended herein.
