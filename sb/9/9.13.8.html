<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
rajno jivatu deho 'yam
prasannah prabhavo yadi
tathety ukte nimih praha
ma bhun me deha-bandhanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajnah--of the King; jivatu--may again be enlivened; dehah ayam--this body (now preserved);
prasannah--very much pleased; prabhavah--all able to do it; yadi--if; tatha--let it be so; iti--thus; ukte--
when it was replied (by the demigods); nimih--Maharaja Nimi; praha--said; ma bhut--do not do it; me--
my; deha-bandhanam--imprisonment again in a material body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so, kindly bring Maharaja Nimi
back to life in this body." The demigods said yes to this request by the sages, but Maharaja Nimi said,
"Please do not imprison me again in a material body."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human beings. Therefore, although the
great saints and sages were also powerful brahmanas, they requested the demigods to revive Maharaja
Nimi's body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should not think that the
demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life
back to a dead body. There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example, according to
the history of Savitri and Satyavan, Satyavan died and was being taken away by Yamaraja, but on the
request of his wife, Savitri, Satyavan was revived in the same body. This is an important fact about the
power of the demigods.
