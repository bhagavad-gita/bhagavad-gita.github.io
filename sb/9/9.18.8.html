<h2>Text</h2>
tam durhrdam suhrd-rupam
kaminam ksana-sauhrdam
indriyaramam utsrjya
svaminam duhkhita yayau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him (the he-goat); durhrdam--cruel hearted; suhrt-rupam--pretending to be a friend; kaminam--
very lusty; ksana-sauhrdam--having friendship for the time being; indriya-aramam--interested only in
sense gratification or sensuality; utsrjya--giving up; svaminam--to her present husband, or to the former
maintainer; duhkhita--being very much aggrieved; yayau--she left.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Aggrieved by her husband's behavior with another, the she-goat thought that the he-goat was not
actually her friend but was hardhearted and was her friend only for the time being. Therefore, because her
husband was lusty, she left him and returned to her former maintainer.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word svaminam is significant. Svami means "caretaker" or "master." Devayani was cared for by
Sukracarya before her marriage, and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayati, but here the word
svaminam indicates that Devayani left the protection of her husband, Yayati, and returned to her former
protector, Sukracarya. Vedic civilization recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man.
During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a
grown son. In any stage of life, a woman should not have independence.
