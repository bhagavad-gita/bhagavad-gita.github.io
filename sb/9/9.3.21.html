<h2>Text</h2>
katham matis te 'vagatanyatha satam
kula-prasute kula-dusanam tv idam
bibharsi jaram yad apatrapa kulam
pitus ca bhartus ca nayasy adhas tamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
katham--how; matih te--your consciousness; avagata--has gone down; anyatha--otherwise; satam--of the
most respectable; kula-prasute--O my daughter, born in the family; kula-dusanam--who are the
degradation of the family; tu--but; idam--this; bibharsi--you are maintaining; jaram--a paramour; yat--as it
is; apatrapa--without shame; kulam--the dynasty; pituh--of your father; ca--and; bhartuh--of your
husband; ca--and; nayasi--you are bringing down; adhah tamah--downward into darkness or hell.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in
this way? Mow is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties
of both your father and your husband to hellish life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in
the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father's
family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the
respectable families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas even today; only the sudras are degraded in this
matter. For a woman of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class to accept another husband in the presence
of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable
in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Saryati, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni's
transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.
