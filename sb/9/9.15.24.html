<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tasmai sa naradevaya
munir arhanam aharat
sasainyamatya-vahaya
havismatya tapo-dhanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmai--unto him; sah--he (Jamadagni); naradevaya--unto King Kartaviryarjuna; munih--the great sage;
arhanam--paraphernalia for worship; aharat--offered; sa-sainya--with his soldiers; amatya--his ministers;
vahaya--and the chariots, the elephants, the horses or the men who carried the palanquins; havismatya--
because of possessing a kamadhenu, a cow that could supply everything; tapah-dhanah--the great sage,
whose only power was his austerity, or who was engaged in austerity.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the forest, received the King very well,
along with the King's soldiers, ministers and carriers. He supplied all the necessities to worship these
guests, for he possessed a kamadhenu cow that was able to supply everything.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Brahma-samhita informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vrndavana,
where Krsna lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam). The surabhi cow is also called
kamadhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one kamadhenu, he was able to get from it everything
desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King's great number of followers,
ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is
accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King's followers properly and feed
them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was
because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the
beginning of his offense. Parasurama, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed
Kartaviryarjuna because Kartaviryarjuna was too proud. One may possess unusual opulence in this
material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Parasurama became angry
at Kartaviryarjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.
