<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
te tu brahmana-devasya
vatsalyam viksya samstutam
pritah klinna-dhiyas tasmai
pratyarpyedam babhasire
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
te--the hota, brahma and other priests; tu--but; brahmana-devasya--of Lord Ramacandra, who loved the
brahmanas so much; vatsalyam--the paternal affection; viksya--after seeing; samstutam--worshiped with
prayers; pritah--being very pleased; klinna-dhiyah--with melted hearts; tasmai--unto Him (Lord
Ramacandra); pratyarpya--returning; idam--this (all the land given to them); babhasire--spoke.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All the brahmanas who were engaged in the various activities of the sacrifice were very pleased with
Lord Ramacandra, who was greatly affectionate and favorable to the brahmanas. Thus with melted hearts
they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous chapter it was said that the prajas, the citizens, strictly followed the system of
varnasrama-dharma. The brahmanas acted exactly like brahmanas, the ksatriyas exactly like ksatriyas, and
so on. Therefore, when Lord Ramacandra gave everything in charity to the brahmanas, the brahmanas,
being qualified, wisely considered that brahmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from
it. The qualifications of a brahmana are given in Bhagavad-gita (18.42):.
samo damas tapah saucam
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jnanam vijnanam astikyam
brahma-karma svabhavajam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness--
these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work." The brahminical character offers no scope for
possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a ksatriya. Therefore, although the brahmanas
did not refuse Lord Ramacandra's gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The brahmanas were
so pleased with Lord Ramacandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord
Ramacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a ksatriya and
was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a ksatriya is to be charitable. A ksatriya, or ruler,
levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases.
Danam isvara-bhavah. On one hand, ksatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very
liberal with charity. When Maharaja Yudhisthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of
distributing it. Karna was very famous as Data Karna. The word data refers to one who gives charity very
liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any
scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A ksatriya's duty is to give charity, and a
brahmana's duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together.
Therefore, when the brahmanas were given so much land by Lord Ramacandra, they returned it to Him
and were not greedy.
