<h2>Text</h2>
rathitarasyaprajasya
bharyayam tantave 'rthitah
angira janayam asa
brahma-varcasvinah sutan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rathitarasya--of Rathitara; aprajasya--who had no sons; bharyayam--unto his wife; tantave--for
increasing offspring; arthitah--being requested; angirah--the great sage Angira; janayam asa--caused to
take birth; brahma-varcasvinah--who had brahminical qualities; sutan--sons.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Rathitara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Angira to beget sons for him. Because
of this request, Angira begot sons in the womb of Rathitara's wife. All these sons were born with
brahminical prowess.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the womb of a lesser man's wife for
the sake of better progeny. In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person
possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because
the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land.
Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but
the sons born of her would then become her husband's sons. Such sons were called ksetra jata. Because
Rathitara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.
