<h2>Text</h2>
svargo na prarthito yasya
manujair amara-priyah
srnvadbhir upagayadbhir
uttamasloka-cestitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
svargah--life in the heavenly planets; na--not; prarthitah--a subject for aspiration; yasya--of whom
(Ambarisa Maharaja); manujaih--by the citizens; amara-priyah--very dear even to the demigods;
srnvadbhih--who were accustomed to hear; upagayadbhih--and accustomed to chant; uttamasloka--of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; cestitam--about the glorious activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The citizens of the state of Maharaja Ambarisa were accustomed to chanting and hearing about the
glorious activities of the Personality of Godhead. Thus they never aspired to be elevated to the heavenly
planets, which are extremely dear even to the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord
and His fame, qualities, form, paraphernalia and so on is never interested in elevation to the heavenly
planets, even though such places are extremely dear even to the demigods.
narayana-parah sarve
na kutascana bibhyati
svargapavarga-narakesv
api tulyartha-darsinah
"Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
never fear any condition of life. The heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to
a devotee." (Bhag. 6.17.28) A devotee is always situated in the spiritual world. Therefore he does not
desire anything. He is known as akama, or desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render
transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Maharaja Ambarisa was a
most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were
not interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly planets.
