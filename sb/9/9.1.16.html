<h2>Text</h2>
hotus tad-vyabhicarena
kanyela nama sabhavat
tam vilokya manuh praha
natitustamana gurum
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hotuh--of the priest; tat--of the yajna; vyabhicarena--by that transgression; kanya--a daughter; ila--Ila;
nama--by the name; sa--that daughter; abhavat--was born; tam--unto her; vilokya--seeing; manuh--Manu;
praha--said; na--not; atitustamanah--very much satisfied; gurum--unto his guru.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Manu had begun that sacrifice for the sake of getting a son, but because the priest was diverted by the
request of Manu's wife, a daughter named Ila was born. Upon seeing the daughter, Manu was not very
satisfied. Thus he spoke to his guru, Vasistha, as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because Manu had no issue, he was pleased at the birth of the child, even though a daughter, and gave
her the name Ila. Later, however, he was not very satisfied to see the daughter instead of a son. Because he
had no issue, he was certainly very glad at the birth of Ila, but his pleasure was temporary.
