<h2>Text</h2>
urvasy uvaca
ma mrthah puruso 'si tvam
ma sma tvadyur vrka ime
kvapi sakhyam na vai strinam
vrkanam hrdayam yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
urvasi uvaca--Urvasi said; ma--do not; mrthah--give up your life; purusah--male; asi--are; tvam--you; ma
sma--do not allow it; tva--unto you; adyuh--may eat; vrkah--the foxes; ime--these senses (do not be under
the control of your senses); kva api--anywhere; sakhyam--friendship; na--not; vai--indeed; strinam--of
women; vrkanam--of the foxes; hrdayam--the heart; yatha--as.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don't be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and
don't allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don't let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should
not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox.
There is no use making friendship with women.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Canakya Pandita has advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: "Never place your faith in a
woman or a politician." Unless elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen,
what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have been compared to sudras and
vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah). On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the
platform of Krsna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sudra or whatever, everyone is equal.
Otherwise, Urvasi, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman's
heart is like that of a sly fox. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But
if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women. Canakya
Pandita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home
and go to the forest.
mata yasya grhe nasti
bharya capriya-vadini
aranyam tena gantavyam
yatharanyam tatha grham
(Canakya-sloka 57)
Krsna conscious grhasthas must be very careful of the sly fox woman. If the wife at home is obedient
and follows her husband in Krsna consciousness, the home is welcome. Otherwise one should give up
one's home and go to the forest.
hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam
vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta
(Bhag. 7.5.5)
One should go to the forest and take shelter of the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
