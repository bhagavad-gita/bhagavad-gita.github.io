<h2>Translation</h2>
To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Ramacandra immediately gave up the position of king
and, accompanied by His wife, mother Sita, wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which
were so delicate that they were unable to bear even the touch of Sita's palms. The Lord was also
accompanied by Hanuman [or by another monkey, Sugriva], king of the monkeys, and by His own
younger brother Lord Laksmana, both of whom gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the
forest. Having cut off the nose and ears of Surpanakha, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from
mother Sita. He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who then
allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean. Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of
Ravana to kill him, like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, Ramacandra, give us all
protection.
