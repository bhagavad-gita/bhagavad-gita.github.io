<h2>Text</h2>
tretayam vartamanayam
kalah krta-samo 'bhavat
rame rajani dharma-jne
sarva-bhuta-sukhavahe
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tretayam--in the Treta-yuga; vartamanayam--although situated in that period; kalah--the period; krta--
with Satya-yuga; samah--equal; abhavat--it so became; rame--because of Lord Ramacandra's being present;
rajani--as the ruling king; dharma-jne--because He was fully religious; sarva-bhuta--of all living entities;
sukha-avahe--giving full happiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Ramacandra became King during Treta-yuga, but because of His good government, the age was
like Satya-yuga. Everyone was religious and completely happy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Among the four yugas--Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali--the Kali-yuga is the worst, but if the process of
varnasrama-dharma is introduced, even in this age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be invoked. The
Hare Krsna movement, or Krsna consciousness movement, is meant for this purpose.
kaler dosa-nidhe rajann
asti hy eko mahan gunah
kirtanad eva krsnasya
mukta-sangah param vrajet
"My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply
by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted
to the transcendental kingdom." (Bhag. 12.3.51) If people take to this sankirtana movement of chanting
Hare Krsna, Hare Rama, they will certainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people
of this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age. Anyone, anywhere, can easily take
to this Hare Krsna movement; one need only chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, observe the rules and
regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if one is sinful and cannot give up
sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly
be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam.
This is the blessing of Lord Ramacandra, who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.
