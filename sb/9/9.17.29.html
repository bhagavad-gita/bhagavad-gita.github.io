<h2>Text</h2>
pitra datta devayanyai
sarmistha sanuga tada
svanam tat sankatam viksya
tad-arthasya ca gauravam
devayanim paryacarat
stri-sahasrena dasavat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pitra--by the father; datta--given; devayanyai--unto Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya; sarmistha--the
daughter of Vrsaparva; sa-anuga--with her friends; tada--at that time; svanam--of his own; tat--that;
sankatam--dangerous position; viksya--observing; tat--from him; arthasya--of the benefit; ca--also;
gauravam--the greatness; devayanim--unto Devayani; paryacarat--served; stri-sahasrena--with thousands
of other women; dasa-vat--acting as a slave.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Vrsaparva wisely thought that Sukracarya's displeasure would bring danger and that his pleasure would
bring material gain. Therefore he carried out Sukracarya's order and served him like a slave. He gave his
daughter Sarmistha to Devayani, and Sarmistha served Devayani like a slave, along with thousands of
other women.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the beginning of these affairs concerning Sarmistha and Devayani, we saw that Sarmistha had many
friends. Now these friends became maidservants of Devayani. When a girl married a ksatriya king, it was
customary for all her girl friends to go with her to her husband's house. For instance, when Vasudeva
married Devaki, the mother of Krsna, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who
accompanied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of
his wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children
were accepted as dasi-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female
population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king
would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen. In the history of
Krsna's household life we find that Krsna married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct
queens, and Krsna expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and
every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many,
many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments.
