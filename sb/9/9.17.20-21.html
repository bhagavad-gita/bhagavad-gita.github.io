<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
With words saturated with love and affection, Devayani said to King Yayati: O great hero, O King,
conqueror of the cities of your enemies, by accepting my hand you have accepted me as your married
wife. Let me not be touched by others, for our relationship as husband and wife has been made possible
by providence, not by any human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
While taking Devayani out of the well, King Yayati must certainly have appreciated her youthful beauty,
and therefore he might have asked her which caste she belonged to. Thus Devayani would have
immediately replied, "We are already married because you have accepted my hand." Uniting the hands of
the bride and bridegroom is a system perpetually existing in all societies. Therefore, as soon as Yayati
accepted Devayani's hand, they could be regarded as married. Because Devayani was enamored with the
hero Yayati, she requested him not to change his mind and let another come to marry her.
