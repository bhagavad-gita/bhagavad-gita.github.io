<h2>Text</h2>
codyamana surair evam
matva vitatham atmajam
vyasrjan maruto 'bibhran
datto 'yam vitathe 'nvaye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
codyamana--although Mamata was encouraged (to maintain the child); suraih--by the demigods; evam--
in this way; matva--considering; vitatham--purposeless; atmajam--her own child; vyasrjat--rejected;
marutah--the demigods known as the Maruts; abibhran--maintained (the child); dattah--the same child
was given; ayam--this; vitathe--was disappointed; anvaye--when the dynasty of Maharaja Bharata.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although encouraged by the demigods to maintain the child, Mamata considered him useless because of
his illicit birth, and therefore she left him. Consequently, the demigods known as the Maruts maintained
the child, and when Maharaja Bharata was disappointed for want of a child, this child was given to him as
his son.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this verse it is understood that those who are rejected from the higher planetary system are given
a chance to take birth in the most exalted families on this planet earth.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Puru."
Chapter Twenty-one
The Dynasty of Bharata
The Dynasty of Bharata;
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Maharaja Bharata, the son of Maharaja
Dusmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamidha and others.
The son of Bharadvaja was Manyu, and Manyu's sons were Brhatksatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara and
Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Sankrti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an
exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the
Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own
food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not
even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a
brahmana guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a
portion of it to the brahmana. When the brahmana left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants
of the food, a sudra appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the sudra and himself.
Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva
therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the
water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him
the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and
show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power
to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure
devotee, not to ordinary devotees.
Garga, the son of Bharadvaja, had a son named Sini, and Sini's son was Gargya. Although Gargya was a
ksatriya by birth, his sons became brahmanas. The son of Mahavirya was Duritaksaya, whose sons were of
a ksatriya king, they also achieved the position of brahmanas. The son of Brhatksatra constructed the city
of Hastinapura and was known as Hasti. His sons were Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha.
From Ajamidha came Priyamedha and other brahmanas and also a son named Brhadisu. The sons,
grandsons and further descendants of Brhadisu were Brhaddhanu, Brhatkaya, Jayadratha, Visada and
Syenajit. From Syenajit came four sons--Rucirasva, Drdhahanu, Kasya and Vatsa. From Rucirasva came a
son named Para, whose sons were Prthusena and Nipa, and from Nipa came one hundred sons. Another
son of Nipa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Visvaksena; from Visvaksena, Udaksena; and from
Udaksena, Bhallata.
The son of Dvimidha was Yavinara, and from Yavinara came many sons and grandsons, such as
Krtiman, Satyadhrti, Drdhanemi, Suparsva, Sumati, Sannatiman, Krti, Nipa, Udgrayudha, Ksemya, Suvira,
Ripunjaya and Bahuratha. Purumidha had no sons, but Ajamidha, in addition to his other sons, had a son
named Nila, whose son was Santi. The descendants of Santi were Susanti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyasva.
Bharmyasva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brahmanas. Mudgala had twins--a
son, Divodasa, and a daughter, Ahalya. From Ahalya, by her husband, Gautama, Satananda was born. The
son of Satananda was Satyadhrti, and his son was Saradvan. Saradvan's son was known as Krpa, and
Saradvan's daughter, known as Krpi, became the wife of Dronacarya.
