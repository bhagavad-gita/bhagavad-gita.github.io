Thereafter, to save the people from the danger of an unregulated government, the sages churned

<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Arajaka-bhayam. If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is danger of fear for the people.
At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see
that the great sages got a son from Nimi's material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance
is the duty of a ksatriya king. A ksatriya is one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called
people's government there is no trained ksatriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he
becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned brahmanas expert in the sastras.
Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men
in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are
happy. The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord Ramacandra, the
government of Maharaja Yudhisthira and the governments of Maharaja Pariksit, Maharaja Ambarisa and
Maharaja Prahlada. There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the
democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are
trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually
people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the
government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures.
