<h2>Text</h2>
evam varsa-sahasrani
manah-sasthair manah-sukham
vidadhano 'pi natrpyat
sarva-bhaumah kad-indriyaih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this way; varsa-sahasrani--for one thousand years; manah-sasthaih--by the mind and five
knowledge-acquiring senses; manah-sukham--temporary happiness created by the mind; vidadhanah--
executing; api--although; na atrpyat--could not be satisfied; sarva-bhaumah--although he was the king of
the entire world; kat-indriyaih--because of possessing impure senses.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although Maharaja Yayati was the king of the entire world and he engaged his mind and five senses in
enjoying material possessions for one thousand years, he was unable to be satisfied.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The kad-indriya, or unpurified senses, can be purified if one engages the senses and the mind in Krsna
consciousness. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must be freed from all designations.
When one identifies himself with the material world, his senses are impure. But when one achieves
spiritual realization and identifies himself as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately.
Engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called bhakti. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam
bhaktir ucyate. One may enjoy the senses for many thousands of years, but unless one purifies the senses,
one cannot be happy.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Yayati Regains His Youth."
Chapter Nineteen
King Yayati Achieves Liberation
This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Maharaja Yayati achieved liberation after he recounted the
figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.
After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayati finally
became disgusted with such materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a
story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved
Devayani. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different
types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to
this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day
thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry,
abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner, to whom she described her husband's
behavior. The brahmana became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon,
the he-goat begged the brahmana's pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat
enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even
the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one's lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One
may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To
extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The sastra therefore advises that by intelligence
one renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot
give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most
learned man. King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He
personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyasi, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and
engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his
beloved wife, Devayani, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the
devotional service of the Lord.
