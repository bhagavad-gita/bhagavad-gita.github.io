<h2>Text</h2>
pururavasa evasit
trayi treta-mukhe nrpa
agnina prajaya raja
lokam gandharvam eyivan
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pururavasah--from King Pururava; eva--thus; asit--there was; trayi--the Vedic principles of karma, jnana
and upasana; treta-mukhe--in the beginning of the Treta-yuga; nrpa--O King Pariksit; agnina--simply by
generating the fire of sacrifice; prajaya--by his son; raja--King Pururava; lokam--to the planet;
gandharvam--of the Gandharvas; eyivan--achieved.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, at the beginning of Treta-yuga, King Pururava inaugurated a karma-kanda
sacrifice. Thus Pururava, who considered the yajnic fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he
desired.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Satya-yuga, Lord Narayana was worshiped by meditation (krte yad dhyayato visnum). Indeed,
everyone always meditated upon Lord Visnu, Narayana, and achieved every success by this process of
meditation. In the next yuga, Treta-yuga, the performance of yajna began (tretayam yajato mukhaih).
Therefore this verse says, trayi treta-mukhe. Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that in Treta-yuga, beginning in the Svayambhuva-manvantara,
ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Pururava Enchanted by Urvasi."
Chapter Fifteen
Parasurama, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation
This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.
From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu, Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son
of Srutayu was Vasuman, the son of Satyayu was Srutanjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was
Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima. Bhima's son was named Kancana, the son of Kancana was
Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the
Ganges in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balaka, Ajaka and Kusa. The
sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kusanabha. From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a
daughter named Satyavati. Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry,
and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni, Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or
Parasurama. When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni's desire cow, Parasurama, who is
ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
killed Kartaviryarjuna. Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times. After Parasurama
killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should
have tolerated the offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised Parasurama to atone for his sin by traveling to
various holy places.
