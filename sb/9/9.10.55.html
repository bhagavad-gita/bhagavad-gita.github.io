<h2>Text</h2>
premnanuvrttya silena
prasrayavanata sati
bhiya hriya ca bhava-jna
bhartuh sitaharan manah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
premna anuvrttya--because of service rendered to the husband with love and faith; silena--by such good
character; prasraya-avanata--always very submissive and ready to satisfy the husband; sati--chaste; bhiya--
by being afraid; hriya--by shyness; ca--also; bhava-jna--understanding the attitude (of the husband);
bhartuh--of her husband, Lord Ramacandra; sita--mother Sita; aharat--simply captivated; manah--the
mind.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Mother Sita was very submissive, faithful, shy and chaste, always understanding the attitude of her
husband. Thus by her character and her love and service she completely attracted the mind of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As Lord Ramacandra is the ideal husband (eka-patni-vrata), mother Sita is the ideal wife. Such a
combination makes family life very happy. Yad yad acarati sresthas tat tad evetaro janah: whatever
example a great man sets, common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the brahmanas, the
teachers, would set forth the examples we receive from Vedic literature, the entire world would be
heaven; indeed, there would no longer be hellish conditions within this material world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Ramacandra."
Chapter Eleven
Lord Ramacandra Rules the World
This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with His younger brothers and
performed various sacrifices.
Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to
worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma
priests. He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance
He gave to the acarya. Lord Ramacandra's faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was
observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had
taken from Him. They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their
hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord Ramacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary
person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By
chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man's house. In the course
of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi. The Lord immediately
returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sitadevi's company. Thus
He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin
sons, named Lava and Kusa. In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada and Citraketu, Bharata
begot two sons named Taksa and Puskala, and Satrughna begot two sons named Subahu and Srutasena.
When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Ramacandra, He fought
many millions of Gandharvas. By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then
brought home. Satrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of
Mathura. Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the
earth. Upon hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices
for thirteen thousand years. After describing the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra's disappearance and
establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by
describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Ramacandra and by describing how the Lord
protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.
