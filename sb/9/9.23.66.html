<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-purusottama, appeared as the son of
Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving relationship
with His confidential devotees. In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned
to Dvaraka, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women,
begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the
principles of householder life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: by all the Vedas, it is Krsna who
is to be known. Lord Sri Krsna, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic
ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of grhastha life by marrying many wives
and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic
principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). To advance in
human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Krsna in
His householder life. The real purpose of Krsna's appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take
part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy
are possible only in Vrndavana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord
immediately left for Vrndavana. In Vrndavana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father
and mother, the gopis and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in order to
protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In Bhagavadgita
the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be purusam sasvatam divyam--the eternal, transcendental
Supreme Person. Here also we find the words utpadya tesu purusah. Therefore it is to be concluded that
the Absolute Truth is purusa, a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His
personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He purusa, a person, but He
is the lila-purusottama, the best of all persons.
