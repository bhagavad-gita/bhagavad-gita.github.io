Bhagavatam, entitled "The Descendants of Ajamidha."
Chapter Twenty-three
The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayati
In this Twenty-third Chapter the dynasties of Anu, Druhyu, Turvasu and Yadu, as well as the story of
Jyamagha, are described.
The sons of Yayati's fourth son, Anu, were Sabhanara, Caksu and Paresnu. Of these three, the sons and
grandsons of Sabhanara were, in succession, Kalanara, Srnjaya, Janamejaya, Mahasala and Mahamana. The
sons of Mahamana were Usinara and Titiksu. Usinara had four sons, namely Sibi, Vara, Krmi and Daksa.
Sibi also had four sons--Vrsadarbha, Sudhira, Madra and Kekaya. The son of Titiksu was Rusadratha, who
begot a son named Homa. From Homa came Sutapa and from Sutapa, Bali. In this way the dynasty
continued. Begotten by Dirghatama in the womb of the wife of Bali were Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Suhma,
Pundra and Odra, all of whom became kings.
From Anga came Khalapana, whose dynasty included Diviratha, Dharmaratha and Citraratha, also
called Romapada, one after another. Maharaja Dasaratha gave in charity one of his daughters, by the name
Santa, to his friend Romapada because Romapada had no sons. Romapada accepted Santa as his daughter,
and the great sage Rsyasrnga married her. By the mercy of Rsyasrnga, Romapada had a son named
Caturanga. The son of Caturanga was Prthulaksa, who had three sons--Brhadratha, Brhatkarma and
Brhadbhanu. From Brhadratha came a son named Brhadmana, whose sons and grandsons in succession
were Jayadratha, Vijaya, Dhrti, Dhrtavrata, Satkarma and Adhiratha. Adhiratha accepted the son rejected
by Kunti, namely Karna, and Karna's son was Vrsasena.
The son of Yayati's third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and grandsons were Setu, Arabdha,
Gandhara, Dharma, Dhrta, Durmada and Praceta.
The son of Yayati's second son, Turvasu, was Vahni, whose seminal dynasty included Bharga,
Bhanuman, Tribhanu, Karandhama and Maruta. The childless Maruta accepted Dusmanta, who belonged
to the Puru dynasty, as his adopted son. Maharaja Dusmanta was anxious to have his kingdom returned,
and so he went back to the Puru-vamsa.
Of the four sons of Yadu, Sahasrajit was the eldest. The son of Sahasrajit was named Satajit. He had
three sons, of whom one was Haihaya. The sons and grandsons in the dynasty of Haihaya were Dharma,
Netra, Kunti, Sohanji, Mahisman, Bhadrasenaka, Dhanaka, Krtavirya, Arjuna, Jayadhvaja, Talajangha and
Vitihotra.
The son of Vitihotra was Madhu, whose eldest son was Vrsni. Because of Yadu, Madhu and Vrsni, their
dynasties are known as Yadava, Madhava and Vrsni. Another son of Yadu was Krosta, and from him came
Vrjinavan, Svahita, Visadgu, Citraratha, Sasabindu, Prthusrava, Dharma, Usana and Rucaka. Rucaka had
five sons, one of whom was known as Jyamagha. Jyamagha was sonless, but by the mercy of the demigods
his childless wife gave birth to a son named Vidarbha.
