drptam ksatram bhuvo bharam
abrahmanyam aninasat
rajas-tamo-vrtam ahan
phalguny api krte 'mhasi
SYNONYMS
drptam--very proud; ksatram--the ksatriyas, the ruling class; bhuvah--of the earth; bharam--burden;
abrahmanyam--sinful, not caring for the religious principles enunciated by the brahmanas; aninasat--
drove away or annihilated; rajah-tamah--by the qualities of passion and ignorance; vrtam--covered; ahan--
he killed; phalguni--not very great; api--although; krte--had been committed; amhasi--an offense.
TRANSLATION
When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and
ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brahmanas, Parasurama killed
them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.
PURPORT
The ksatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations
enacted by great brahmanas and saintly persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in
regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, rajas-tamo-vrtam,
bharam abrahmanyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely
ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power.
We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but
unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourthclass
men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished
in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former
monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the
mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded. When the government is actually
guided by brahmanas, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people. Therefore
in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the
brahmanas, headed by such a ksatriya-spirited brahmana as Parasurama, killed them twenty-one
consecutive times.
In Kali-yuga, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-prayesu rajasu: the ruling class (rajanya)
will be no better than plunderers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize
the affairs of the government. Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations,
they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration. As stated elsewhere in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40):
asamskrtah kriya-hina
rajasa tamasavrtah
prajas te bhaksayisyanti
mleccha rajanya-rupinah
Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of
passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government
(rajanya-rupinah), will swallow the citizens (prajas te bhaksayisyanti). And in still another place, Srimad-
Bhagavatam (12.2.7-8) says:
evam prajabhir dustabhir
akirne ksiti-mandale
brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam
yo bali bhavita nrpah
praja hi lubdhai rajanyair
nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih
acchinna-dara-dravina
yasyanti giri-kananam
Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya
srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society
are not considered, the result will be brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam yo bali bhavita nrpah: the so-called
caste system of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow
or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the prajas, or citizens, will be so
harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yasyanti giri-kananam) to
escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of
plunderers. Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must take to the Krsna consciousness
movement, the Hare Krsna movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now
appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. Therefore, when the prajas become Krsna conscious, they
can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of
material existence.
