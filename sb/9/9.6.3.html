<h2>Text</h2>
ete ksetra-prasuta vai
punas tv angirasah smrtah
rathitaranam pravarah
ksetropeta dvi-jatayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ete--the sons begotten by Angira; ksetra-prasutah--became the children of Rathitara and belonged to his
family (because they were born from the womb of his wife); vai--indeed; punah--again; tu--but;
angirasah--of the dynasty of Angira; smrtah--they were called; rathitaranam--of all the sons of Rathitara;
pravarah--the chief; ksetra-upetah--because of being born of the ksetra (field); dvi-jatayah--called
brahmana (being a mixture of brahmana and ksatriya).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having been born from the womb of Rathitara's wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of
Rathitara, but because they were born from the semen of Angira, they were also known as the dynasty of
Angira. Among all the progeny of Rathitara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their
birth, they were considered brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the meaning of dvi jatayah as "mixed caste," indicating a
mixture of brahmana and ksatriya.
