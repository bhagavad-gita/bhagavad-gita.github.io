<h2>Text</h2>
namas tubhyam bhagavate
vasudevaya vedhase
sarva-bhutadhivasaya
santaya brhate namah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
namah--I offer my respectful obeisances; tubhyam--unto You; bhagavate--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; vasudevaya--Lord Vasudeva; vedhase--the creator of everything; sarva-bhuta-adhivasaya--
present everywhere (within the heart of every living entity and within the atom also); santaya--peaceful,
as if completely inactive; brhate--the greatest of all; namah--I offer my respectful obeisances.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord Vasudeva, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, You are the creator of the entire cosmic
manifestation. You live as the Supersoul in everyone's heart and are smaller than the smallest, yet You are
greater than the greatest and are all-pervading. You appear completely silent, having nothing to do, but
this is due to Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I therefore offer my respectful
obeisances unto You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
How Devayani became self-realized by the grace of her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, is described
here. Describing such realization is another way of performing the bhakti process.
sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
"Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes
of Lord Visnu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship,
offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and
surrendering everything unto Him--these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service." (Bhag.
7.5.23) sravanam kirtanam, hearing and chanting, are especially important. By hearing from her husband
about the greatness of Lord Vasudeva, Devayani certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto
the lotus feet of the Lord (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya). This is knowledge. Bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate. Surrender to Vasudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many
births. As soon as one surrenders unto Vasudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her association
with her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, Devayani became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga,
and thus became liberated.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Yayati Achieves Liberation."
Chapter Twenty
The Dynasty of Puru
This chapter describes the history of Puru and his descendant Dusmanta. The son of Puru was
Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan. The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after
another, were Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Samyati, Ahamyati and Raudrasva.
Raudrasva had ten sons--Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu, Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu,
Vrateyu and Vaneyu. The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons--Sumati, Dhruva and
Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva's son was Medhatithi. The sons of Medhatithi,
headed by Praskanna, were all brahmanas. The son of Rantinava named Sumati had a son named Rebhi,
and his son was Dusmanta.
While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an
extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her. That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and
her name was Sakuntala. Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the forest, where Kanva Muni
found her. Kanva Muni brought her to his asrama, where he raised and maintained her. When Sakuntala
accepted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gandharva-vidhi. Sakuntala
later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his
kingdom.
In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but Dusmanta, having returned to the
capital, forgot what had taken place. Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born
child, Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later, however, after a mysterious
omen, the King accepted them. After Maharaja Dusmanta's death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was
enthroned. He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brahmanas.
This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as
his son.
