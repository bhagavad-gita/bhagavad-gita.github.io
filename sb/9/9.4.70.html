<h2>Text</h2>
tapo vidya ca vipranam
nihsreyasa-kare ubhe
te eva durvinitasya
kalpete kartur anyatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tapah--austerities; vidya--knowledge; ca--also; vipranam--of the brahmanas; nihsreyasa--of what is
certainly very auspicious for upliftment; kare--are causes; ubhe--both of them; te--such austerity and
knowledge; eva--indeed; durvinitasya--when such a person is an upstart; kalpete--become; kartuh--of the
performer; anyatha--just the opposite.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For a brahmana, austerity and learning are certainly auspicious, but when acquired by a person who is
not gentle, such austerity and learning are most dangerous.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that a jewel is very valuable, but when it is on the hood of a serpent, it is dangerous despite its
value. Similarly, when a materialistic nondevotee achieves great success in learning and austerity, that
success is dangerous for all of society. So-called learned scientists, for example, invented atomic weapons
that are dangerous for all humanity. It is therefore said, manina bhusitah sarpah kim asau na
bhayankarah. A serpent with a jewel on its hood is as dangerous as a serpent without such a jewel.
Durvasa Muni was a very learned brahmana equipped with mystic power, but because he was not a
gentleman, he did not know how to use his power. He was therefore extremely dangerous. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a dangerous person who uses his mystic power for some
personal design. By the laws of nature, therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for
society but for the person who misuses it.
