<h2>Text</h2>
sa sannivasam suhrdam

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa--Devayani; sannivasam--living in the association; suhrdam--of friends and relatives; prapayam--in a
place where water is supplied; iva--like; gacchatam--of tourists on a program for going from one place to
another; vijnaya--understanding; isvara-tantranam--under the influence of the rigid laws of nature; mayaviracitam--
the laws enforced by maya, the illusory energy; prabhoh--of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; sarvatra--everywhere in this material world; sangam--association; utsrjya--giving up; svapnaaupamyena--
by the analogy of a dream; bhargavi--Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya; krsne--unto Lord
Krsna; manah--complete attention; samavesya--fixing; vyadhunot--gave up; lingam--the gross and subtle
bodies; atmanah--of the soul.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya, understood that the materialistic association of
husband, friends and relatives is like the association in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships of society,
friendship and love are created by the maya of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream.
By the grace of Krsna, Devayani gave up her imaginary position in the material world. Completely fixing
her mind upon Krsna, she achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman, Krsna, but
has somehow or other been entrapped by the material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting
of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. One should know that the association of
society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are nothing but creations of maya. One's only
business is to become Krsna conscious and render service unto Krsna as extensively as possible for a
living being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By the grace of Krsna, Devayani attained
this state through the instructions of her husband.
