athesa-maya-racitesu sangam
gunesu gandharva-puropamesu
rudham prakrtyatmani visva-kartur
bhavena hitva tam aham prapadye
SYNONYMS
atha--therefore; isa-maya--by the external potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; racitesu--in
things manufactured; sangam--attachment; gunesu--in the modes of material nature; gandharva-puraupamesu--
which are compared to the illusion of a gandharva-pura, a town or houses seen in the forest or
on a hill; rudham--very powerful; prakrtya--by material nature; atmani--unto the Supersoul; visvakartuh--
of the creator of the whole universe; bhavena--by devotional service; hitva--giving up; tam--unto
Him (the Lord); aham--I; prapadye--surrender.
TRANSLATION
Therefore I should now give up my attachment for things created by the external energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. I should engage in thought of the Lord and should thus surrender unto Him.
This material creation, having been created by the external energy of the Lord, is like an imaginary town
visualized on a hill or in a forest. Every conditioned soul has a natural attraction and attachment for
material things, but one must simply give up this attachment and surrender unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
PURPORT
When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may sometimes see a city in the sky
with towers and palaces, or one may see similar things in a big forest. This is called a gandharva-pura, a
phantasmagoria. This entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and every materially situated person
has attachment for it. But Khatvanga Maharaja, because of his advanced Krsna consciousness, was not
interested in such things. Even though a devotee may engage in apparently materialistic activities, he
knows his position very well. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate. If one engages all
material things in relation with the loving service of the Lord, one is situated in yukta-vairagya, proper
renunciation. In this material world, nothing should be accepted for one's sense gratification: everything
should be accepted for the service of the Lord. This is the mentality of the spiritual world. Maharaja
Khatvanga advises that one give up material attachments and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Thus one achieves success in life. This is pure bhakti-yoga, which involves vairagya-vidya--
renunciation and knowledge.
vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yogasiksartham
ekah purusah puranah
sri-krsna-caitanya-sarira-dhari
krpambudhir yas tam aham prapadye
"Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared now as Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and has come down to teach us material detachment, learning
and devotional service to Himself." (Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka 6.74) Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu
inaugurated this movement of vairagya-vidya, by which one detaches himself from material existence and
engages in loving devotional service. The Krsna consciousness movement of devotional service is the only
process by which to counteract our false prestige in this material world.
