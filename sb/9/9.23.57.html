<h2>Text</h2>
na hy asya janmano hetuh
karmano va mahipate
atma-mayam vinesasya
parasya drastur atmanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; hi--indeed; asya--of Him (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); janmanah--of the appearance,
or taking birth; hetuh--there is any cause; karmanah--or for acting; va--either; mahipate--O King
(Maharaja Pariksit); atma-mayam--His supreme compassion for the fallen souls; vina--without; isasya--of
the supreme controller; parasya--of the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the material world;
drastuh--of the Supersoul, who witnesses everyone's activities; atmanah--of the Supersoul of everyone.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, Maharaja Pariksit, but for the Lord's personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance,
disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul, He knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that
affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living
being. An ordinary living being receives a particular type of body according to his past activities (karmana
daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye). A living being is never independent and can never appear
independently. Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed upon him by maya according to his past
karma. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), yantrarudhani mayaya. The body is a kind of machine
created and offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body awarded to him
by maya, the material energy, according to his karma. One cannot independently say, "Give me a body
like this" or "Give me a body like that." One must accept whatever body is offered by the material energy.
This is the position of the ordinary living being.
When Krsna descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion for the fallen souls. As the
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion,
I advent Myself millennium after millennium." The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear. Indeed, no one
can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under His control,
and He is not under the control of anyone else. Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge
think that one can equal Krsna or become Krsna are condemned in every way. No one can equal or
surpass Krsna, who is therefore described as asamaurdhva. According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the
word maya is used in the sense of "false pride" and also in the sense of "compassion." For an ordinary
living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14),
daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: "This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes
of material nature, is difficult to overcome." But when Krsna comes the word maya refers to His
compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls. By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone,
whether sinful or pious.
