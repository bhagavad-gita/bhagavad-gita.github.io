<h2>Text</h2>
so 'sav aste yoga-siddhah
kalapa-gramam asthitah
kaler ante surya-vamsam
nastam bhavayita punah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; asau--the personality known as Maru; aste--still existing; yoga-siddhah--perfection in the power
of mystic yoga; kalapa-gramam--the place named Kalapa-grama; asthitah--he is still living there; kaleh--of
this Kali-yuga; ante--at the end; surya-vamsam--the descendants of the sun-god; nastam--after being lost;
bhavayita--Maru will begin by begetting a son; punah--again.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having achieved perfection in the power of mystic yoga, Maru still lives in a place known as Kalapagrama.
At the end of Kali-yuga, he will revive the lost Surya dynasty by begetting a son.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At least five thousand years ago, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami ascertained the existence of Maru in Kalapagrama
and said that Maru, having achieved a yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of
Kali-yuga, which is calculated to continue for 432,000 years. Such is the perfection of mystic power. By
controlling the breath, the perfect yogi can continue his life for as long as he likes. Sometimes we hear
from the Vedic literature that some personalities from the Vedic age, such as Vyasadeva and Asvatthama,
are still living. Here we understand that Maru is also still living. We are sometimes surprised that a mortal
body can live for such a long time. The explanation of this longevity is given here by the word yogasiddha.
If one becomes perfect in the practice of yoga, he can live as long as he likes. The demonstration
of some trifling yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection. Here is a factual example of perfection: a yogasiddha
can live as long as he likes.
