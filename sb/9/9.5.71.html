O best of the brahmanas, you should therefore go immediately to King Ambarisa, the son of Maharaja

PURPORT
In this regard, Madhva Muni quotes from the Garuda Purana:
brahmadi-bhakti-koty-amsad
amso naivambarisake
naivanyasya cakrasyapi
tathapi harir isvarah
tatkalikopaceyatvat
tesam yasasa adirat
brahmadayas ca tat-kirtim
vyanjayam asur uttamam
mohanaya ca daityanam
brahmade nindanaya ca
anyartham ca svayam visnur
brahmadyas ca nirasisah
manusesuttamatvac ca
tesam bhaktyadibhir gunaih
brahmader visnv-adhinatvajnapanaya
ca kevalam
durvasas ca svayam rudras
tathapy anyayam uktavan
tasyapy anugraharthaya
darpa-nasartham eva ca
The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Maharaja Ambarisa and Durvasa Muni is that
all the demigods, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, are under the control of Lord Visnu. Therefore,
when a Vaisnava is offended, the offender is punished by Visnu, the Supreme Lord. No one can protect
such a person, even Lord Brahma or Lord Siva.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni."
Chapter Five
Durvasa Muni's Life Spared
In this chapter we find Maharaja Ambarisa offering prayers to the Sudarsana cakra and we find how the
Sudarsana cakra became merciful to Durvasa Muni.
By the order of the Supreme personality of Godhead, Visnu, Durvasa Muni immediately went to
Maharaja Ambarisa and fell at his lotus feet. Maharaja Ambarisa, being naturally very humble and meek,
felt shy and ashamed because Durvasa Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to
the Sudarsana cakra just to save Durvasa. What is this Sudarsana cakra? The Sudarsana cakra is the glance
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world. Sa aiksata, sa
asrjata. This is the Vedic version. The Sudarsana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is most dear to
the Lord, has thousands of spokes. This Sudarsana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons,
the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of
establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his mercy, the
universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarsana cakra is employed by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. When Maharaja Ambarisa thus prayed that the Sudarsana cakra be merciful, the
Sudarsana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durvasa Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarsana
cakra's mercy. Durvasa Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaisnava an ordinary
person (vaisnave jati-buddhi). Maharaja Ambarisa belonged to the ksatriya group, and therefore Durvasa
Muni considered him lower than the brahmanas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him.
By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaisnavas. After this
incident, Maharaja Ambarisa gave Durvasa Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been
standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took prasada. Maharaja Ambarisa
later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Manasa-sarovara to execute
devotional meditation.
