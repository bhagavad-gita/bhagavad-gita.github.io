<h2>Text</h2>
prag distam bhrtya-raksayam
purusena mahatmana
dadaha krtyam tam cakram
kruddhahim iva pavakah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prak distam--as previously arranged; bhrtya-raksayam--for the protection of his servants; purusena--by
the Supreme Person; maha-atmana--by the Supersoul; dadaha--burnt to ashes; krtyam--that created
demon; tam--him; cakram--the disc; kruddha--angry; ahim--a serpent; iva--like; pavakah--fire.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake, so, by the previous order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, His disc, the Sudarsana cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the created
demon to protect the Lord's devotee.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa, although in such danger, did not move an inch from his
position, nor did he request the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give him protection. He was fixed in
understanding, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
the core of his heart. A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead always, not for any material profit, but as his duty. The Lord, however, knows how to protect
His devotee. As indicated by the words prag distam, the Lord knew everything. Therefore, before anything
happened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect Maharaja Ambarisa. This protection is offered
to a devotee even from the very beginning of his devotional service. Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah
pranasyati (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately protected by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.66): aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami. Protection begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the devotee
proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in Krsna
consciousness without outward disturbances. A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the
furious snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy of a devotee may
be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional service.
