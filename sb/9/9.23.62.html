<h2>Text</h2>
yasmin sat-karna-piyuse
yasas-tirtha-vare sakrt
srotranjalir upasprsya
dhunute karma-vasanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasmin--in the history of the transcendental activities of Krsna upon the surface of the earth; sat-karnapiyuse--
who pleases the demands of the transcendental, purified ears; yasah-tirtha-vare--keeping oneself
in the best of holy places by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord; sakrt--once only,
immediately; srotra-anjalih--in the form of hearing the transcendental message; upasprsya--touching
(exactly like the water of the Ganges); dhunute--destroys; karma-vasanam--the strong desire for fruitive
activities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the
Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they
are no longer interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve freedom from the material world. For
sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of
janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi--birth, death, old age and disease--but the devotee, simply by hearing the
message of Bhagavad-gita and further relishing the narrations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, becomes so pure
that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities. At the moment, devotees in the Western
countries are being attracted by Krsna consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities,
and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement. But they cannot possibly check this movement
or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions. Here the words
srotranjalir upasprsya indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the
devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive
activities. Anyabhilasita-sunyam Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the
devotees are freed from such activities. The devotees are situated in liberation (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate),
and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhoja--assisted by the Bhoja dynasty; vrsni--and by the Vrsnis; andhaka--and by the Andhakas; madhu--
and by the Madhus; surasena--and by the Surasenas; dasarhakaih--and by the Dasarhakas; slaghaniya--by

Kurus and Srnjayas; snigdha--affectionate; smita--smiling; iksita--being regarded as; udaraih--
magnanimous; vakyaih--the instructions; vikrama-lilaya--the pastimes of heroism; nr-lokam--human
society; ramayam asa--pleased; murtya--by His personal form; sarva-anga-ramyaya--the form that pleases
everyone by all parts of the body.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vrsni, Andhaka, Madhu, Surasena, Dasarha, Kuru, Srnjaya and
Pandu, Lord Krsna performed various activities. By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His
instructions and His uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His
transcendental body, pleased all of human society.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words nrlokam ramayam asa murtya sarvanga-ramyaya are significant. Krsna is the original form.
Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word murtya. The word
murti means "form." Krsna, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of
His transcendental body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti). The Lord is narakrti, exactly
resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word sarvangaramyaya
informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling
face, every part of His body--His hands, His legs, His chest--is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any
time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.
