<h2>Text</h2>
tam apatantim jvalatim
asi-hastam pada bhuvam
vepayantim samudviksya
na cacala padan nrpah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--that (demon); apatantim--coming forward to attack him; jvalatim--blazing like fire; asi-hastam--
with a trident in his hand; pada--with his footstep; bhuvam--the surface of the earth; vepayantim--causing
to tremble; samudviksya--seeing him perfectly; na--not; cacala--moved; padat--from his place; nrpah--the
King.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Taking a trident in his hand and making the surface of the earth tremble with his footsteps, that blazing
creature came before Maharaja Ambarisa. But the King, upon seeing him, was not at all disturbed and did
not move even slightly from his position.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati (Bhag. 6.17.28). A pure devotee of Narayana is never afraid
of any material danger. There are many examples of devotees such as Prahlada Maharaja, who was
tortured by his father but was not at all afraid, although he was only a five-year-old boy. Therefore,
following the examples of Ambarisa Maharaja and Prahlada Maharaja, a devotee should learn how to
tolerate all such awkward positions in this world. Devotees are often tortured by nondevotees, yet the
pure devotee, depending fully on the mercy of the Supreme personality of Godhead, is never disturbed by
such inimical activities.
