<h2>Translation</h2>
When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she
desired to accept him as her husband. When she did so, many other she-goats also desired him as their
husband because he had a very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert
in discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost
exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities
and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham
hi tuccham. Although one becomes a grhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart's content, one
is never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get
the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for selfrealization.
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam
Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (dehino 'smin yatha
dehe). A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body.
However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from
bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist
haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily
concept of life.
