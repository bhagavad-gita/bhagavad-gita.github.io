<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tyaja--deliver; tyaja--deliver; asu--immediately; dusprajne--you foolish woman; mat-ksetrat--from the
womb meant for me to impregnate; ahitam--begotten; paraih--by others; na--not; aham--I; tvam--you;
bhasmasat--burnt to ashes; kuryam--shall make; striyam--because you are a woman; santanike--wanting a

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Brhaspati said: You foolish woman, your womb, which was meant for me to impregnate, has been
impregnated by someone other than me. Immediately deliver your child! Immediately deliver it! Be
assured that after the child is delivered, I shall not burn you to ashes. I know that although you are
unchaste, you wanted a son. Therefore I shall not punish you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Tara was married to Brhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should have been impregnated by
him. But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was
unchaste. Although Brhaspati accepted Tara from Brahma, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted
her to deliver a son immediately. Tara certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might
be punished after giving birth. Thus Brhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she
was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son.
