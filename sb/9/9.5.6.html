<br>

<h2>Translation</h2>
O Sudarsana, you have a very auspicious hub, and therefore you are the upholder of all religion. You are
just like an inauspicious comet for the irreligious demons. Indeed, you are the maintainer of the three
worlds, you are full of transcendental effulgence, you are as quick as the mind, and you are able to work
wonders. I can simply utter the word namah, offering all obeisances unto you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The disc of the Lord is called Sudarsana because he does not discriminate between high and low
criminals or demons. Durvasa Muni was certainly a powerful brahmana, but his acts against the pure
devotee Maharaja Ambarisa were no better than the activities of asuras. As stated in the sastras, dharmam
tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam: the word dharma refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: real dharma is surrender
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to
the Lord. The Sudarsana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma. Maharaja
Ambarisa was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarsana cakra was ready
to punish even such a strict brahmana as Durvasa Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are
demons even in the form of brahmanas. Therefore the Sudarsana cakra does not discriminate between
brahmana demons and sudra demons. Anyone against the Supreme personality of Godhead and His
devotees is called a demon. In the sastras we find many brahmanas and ksatriyas who acted as demons
and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the sastras, one has to be understood
according to his symptoms. If one is born of a brahmana father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is
regarded as a demon. The Sudarsana cakra is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore
he is described as adharma-silasura-dhuma-ketave. Those who are not devotees are called adharma-sila.
The Sudarsana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons.
