<h2>Text</h2>
deham navarurutse 'ham
duhkha-soka-bhayavaham
sarvatrasya yato mrtyur
matsyanam udake yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
deham--a material body; na--not; avarurutse--desire to accept; aham--I; duhkha-soka-bhaya-avaham--
which is the cause of all kinds of distress, lamentation and fear; sarvatra--always and everywhere within
this universe; asya--of the living entities who have accepted material bodies; yatah--because; mrtyuh--
death; matsyanam--of the fish; udake--living within the water; yatha--like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all distress, lamentation and
fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in anxiety because
of fear of death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is destined to die. In the lower
planetary system or lower species of life one may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one
may live for a long, long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be understood. In the human form
of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing
tapasya. This is the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani. This can be done only when one is Krsna conscious, or has achieved the service
of the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material body
subject to birth, death, old age and disease.
The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the fish is never free from anxiety
about death, since big fish are always eager to eat the small fish. phalguni tatra mahatam: all living entities
are eaten by bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature.
ahastani sahastanam
apadani catus-padam
phalguni tatra mahatam
jivo jivasya jivanam
"Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the
four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is
food for another." (Bhag. 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material world in
such a way that one living entity is food for another. Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although
we speak of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord.
Harim vina naiva srtim taranti: one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming a
devotee. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.3). Aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani.
One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna must certainly wander up and down within the
cycle of birth and death.
