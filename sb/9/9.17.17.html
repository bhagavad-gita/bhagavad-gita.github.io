TRANSLATION
From Haryabala came a son named Sahadeva, and from Sahadeva came Hina. The son of Hina was
Jayasena, and the son of Jayasena was Sankrti. The son of Sankrti was the powerful and expert fighter
named Jaya. These kings were the members of the Ksatravrddha dynasty. Now let me describe to you the
dynasty of Nahusa.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Pururava."
Chapter Eighteen
King Yayati Regains His Youth
This chapter gives the history of King Yayati, the son of Nahusa. Among Yayati's five sons, the youngest
son, Puru, accepted Yayati's invalidity.
When Nahusa, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, Yati, took sannyasa,
and therefore the next son, Yayati, was enthroned as king. By providence, Yayati married the daughter of
Sukracarya. Sukracarya was a brahmana and Yayati a ksatriya, but Yayati married her nonetheless.
Sukracarya's daughter, named Devayani, had a girl friend named Sarmistha, who was the daughter of
Vrsaparva. King Yayati married Sarmistha also. The history of this marriage is as follows. Once Sarmistha
was sporting in the water with thousands of her girl friends, and Devayani was also there. When the
young girls saw Lord Siva, seated on his bull with Uma, they immediately dressed themselves, but
Sarmistha mistakenly put on Devayani's clothes. Devayani, being very angry, rebuked Sarmistha, who also
became very angry and responded by rebuking Devayani and throwing her into a well. By chance, King
Yayati came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayani and rescued her. Thus Devayani accepted
Maharaja Yayati as her husband. Thereafter, Devayani, crying loudly, told her father about Sarmistha's
behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, Sukracarya was very angry and wanted to chastise Vrsaparva,
Sarmistha's father. Vrsaparva, however, satisfied Sukracarya by offering Sarmistha as Devayani's
maidservant. Thus Sarmistha, as the maidservant of Devayani, also went to the house of Devayani's
husband. When Sarmistha found her friend Devayani with a son she also desired to have a son. Therefore,
at the proper time for conception, she also requested Maharaja Yayati for sex. When Sarmistha became
pregnant also, Devayani was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father's house and
told her father everything. Sukracarya again became angry and cursed Maharaja Yayati to become old, but
when Yayati begged Sukracarya to be merciful to him, Sukracarya gave him the benediction that he could
transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yayati exchanged his old age for the youth of his
youngest son, Puru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.
