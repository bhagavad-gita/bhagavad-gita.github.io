<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--in this way (some sons having been cursed and some blessed); kausika-gotram--the dynasty of
Kausika; tu--indeed; visvamitraih--by the sons of Visvamitra; prthak-vidham--in different varieties;
pravara-antaram--differences between one another; apannam--obtained; tat--that; hi--indeed; ca--also;

<h2>Translation</h2>
Visvamitra cursed some of his sons and blessed the others, and he also adopted a son. Thus there were
varieties in the Kausika dynasty, but among all the sons, Devarata was considered the eldest.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Lord Parasurama Destroys the World's Ruling Class."
Chapter Seventeen
The Dynasties of the Sons of Pururava
Ayu, the eldest son of Pururava, had five sons. This chapter describes the dynasties of four of them,
beginning with Ksatravrddha.
Ayu, the son of Pururava, had five sons-- Nahusa, Ksatravrddha, Raji, Rabha and Anena. The son of
Ksatravrddha was Suhotra, who had three sons, named Kasya, Kusa and Grtsamada. The son of
Grtsamada was Sunaka, and his son was Saunaka. The son of Kasya was Kasi. From Kasi came the sons
and grandsons known as Rastra, Dirghatama and then Dhanvantari, who was the inaugurator of medical
science and was a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. The
descendants of Dhanvantari were Ketuman, Bhimaratha, Divodasa and Dyuman, who was also known as
Pratardana, Satrujit, Vatsa, Rtadhvaja and Kuvalayasva. The son of Dyuman was Alarka, who reigned over
the kingdom for many, many years. Following in the dynasty of Alarka were Santati, Sunitha, Niketana,
Dharmaketu, Satyaketu, Dhrstaketu, Sukumara, Vitihotra, Bharga and Bhargabhumi. All of them belonged
to the dynasty of Kasi, the descendant of Ksatravrddha.
The son of Rabha was Rabhasa, and his son was Gambhira. Gambhira's son was Akriya, and from Akriya
came Brahmavit. The son of Anena was Suddha, and his son was Suci. The son of Suci was Citrakrt,
whose son was Santaraja. Raji had five hundred sons, all of extraordinary strength. Raji was personally
very powerful and was given the kingdom of heaven by Lord Indra. Later, after Raji's death, when the
sons of Raji refused to return the kingdom to Indra, by Brhaspati's arrangement they became
unintelligent, and Lord Indra conquered them.
The grandson of Ksatravrddha named Kusa gave birth to a son named Prati. From Prati came Sanjaya;
from Sanjaya, Jaya; from Jaya, Krta; and from Krta, Haryabala. The son of Haryabala was Sahadeva; the
son of Sahadeva, Hina; the son of Hina, Jayasena; the son of Jayasena, Sankrti; and the son of Sankrti, Jaya.
