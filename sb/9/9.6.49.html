<h2>Text</h2>
sa kadacid upasina
atmapahnavam atmanah
dadarsa bahv-rcacaryo
mina-sanga-samutthitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he, Saubhari Muni; kadacit--one day; upasinah--sitting down; atma-apahnavam--degrading oneself
from the platform of tapasya; atmanah--self-caused; dadarsa--observed; bahu-rca-acaryah--Saubhari Muni,
who was expert in chanting mantras; mina-sanga--the sexual affairs of fish; samutthitam--caused by this
incident.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded
place, he thought to himself about the cause of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated
himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a
vaisnava-aparadha. The history is that when Garuda wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave
the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuda's plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni
certainly committed a great offense to a Vaisnava. Because of this vaisnava-aparadha, an offense at the
lotus feet of a Vaisnava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya. One should not,
therefore, impede the activities of a Vaisnava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident
concerning Saubhari Muni.
