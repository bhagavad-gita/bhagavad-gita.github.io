matra svasra duhitra va
naviviktasano bhavet
balavan indriya-gramo
vidvamsam api karsati
SYNONYMS
matra--with one's mother; svasra--with one's sister; duhitra--with ones own daughter; va--either; na--
not; avivikta-asanah--seated closely on one seat; bhavet--one should be; balavan--very strong; indriyagramah--
the group of senses; vidvamsam--the very learned and advanced person; api--even; karsati--
agitates.
TRANSLATION
One should not allow oneself to sit on the same seat even with one's own mother, sister or daughter, for
the senses are so strong that even though one is very advanced in knowledge, he may be attracted by sex.
PURPORT
Learning the etiquette of how to deal with women does not free one from sexual attraction. As
specifically mentioned herewith, such attraction is possible even with one's mother, sister or daughter.
Generally, of course, one is not sexually attracted to his mother, sister or daughter, but if one allows
himself to sit very close to such a woman, one may be attracted. This is a psychological fact. It may be said
that one is liable to be attracted if he is not very advanced in civilized life; however, as specifically
mentioned here, vidvamsam api karsati: even if one is highly advanced, materially or spiritually, he may
be attracted by lusty desires. The object of attraction may even be one's mother, sister or daughter.
Therefore, one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was most
strict in such dealings, especially after He accepted the sannyasa order. Indeed, no woman could come
near Him to offer Him respect. Again, one is warned herewith that one should be extremely careful in
dealings with women. A brahmacari is forbidden even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens
to be young. The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from the disciple of her
husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of the spiritual master is young, a brahmacari is
forbidden to render service to her.
