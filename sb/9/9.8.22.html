<h2>Text</h2>
ye deha-bhajas tri-guna-pradhana
gunan vipasyanty uta va tamas ca
yan-mayaya mohita-cetasas tvam
viduh sva-samstham na bahih-prakasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ye--those persons who; deha-bhajah--have accepted the material body; tri-guna-pradhanah--influenced
by the three modes of material nature; gunan--the manifestation of the three modes of material nature;
vipasyanti--can see only; uta--it is so said; va--either; tamah--the mode of ignorance; ca--and; yat-mayaya--
by the illusory energy of whom; mohita--has been bewildered; cetasah--the core of whose heart; tvam--
Your Lordship; viduh--know; sva-samstham--situated in one's own body; na--not; bahih-prakasah--those
who can see only the products of external energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone's heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body,
cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material
nature. Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna, they can see only the
actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature. Because of the actions and reactions of the
mode of ignorance, whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only the workings of
material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, one is unable to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is situated in everyone's heart. However, because the
conditioned souls are influenced by material nature, they can see only the actions and reactions of
material nature, but not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One therefore must purify himself
internally and externally:
apavitrah pavitro va
sarvavastham gato 'pi va
yah smaret pundarikaksam
sa bahyabhyantarah sucih
To keep ourselves externally clean we should bathe three times daily, and for internal cleanliness we
must cleanse the heart by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. The members of the Krsna consciousness
movement must always follow this principle (bahyabhyantarah sucih). Then it will one day be possible to
see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.
