<h2>Translation</h2>
Formerly, in his previous birth, Asamanjasa had been a great mystic yogi, but by bad association he had
fallen from his exalted position. Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a jati-smara; that
is, he had the special advantage of being able to remember his past birth. Nonetheless, he wanted to
display himself as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were abominable in the eyes of the
public and unfavorable to his relatives. He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayu by
throwing them into the depths of the water.
