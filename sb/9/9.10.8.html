<h2>Translation</h2>
Carrying out the order of His father, who was bound by a promise to his wife, Lord Ramacandra left
behind His kingdom, opulence, friends, well-wishers, residence and everything else, just as a liberated
soul gives up his life, and went to the forest with Sita.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Dasaratha had three wives. One of them, Kaikeyi, served him very pleasingly, and he therefore
wanted to give her a benediction. Kaikeyi, however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it
was necessary. At the time of the coronation of Prince Ramacandra, Kaikeyi requested her husband to
enthrone her son Bharata and send Ramacandra to the forest. Maharaja Dasaratha, being bound by his
promise, ordered Ramacandra to go to the forest, according to the dictation of his beloved. And the Lord,
as an obedient son, accepted the order immediately. He left everything without hesitation, just as a
liberated soul or great yogi gives up his life without material attraction.
