<h2>Translation</h2>
In performing his prescribed duties as king, Maharaja Ambarisa always offered the results of his royal
activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the enjoyer of everything and is beyond
the perception of material senses. He certainly took advice from brahmanas who were faithful devotees of
the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material world, and here in
Bhagavad-gita the peace formula is given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone
should understand that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the
planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so
on. The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gita, and Ambarisa Maharaja, as the ideal executive
head, ruled the entire world as a Vaisnava, taking advice from Vaisnava brahmanas. The sastras enjoin
that even though a brahmana may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very
learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru until he is a Vaisnava.
sat-karma-nipuno vipro
mantra-tantra-visaradah
avaisnavo gurur na syad
vaisnavah sva-paco guruh
Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-nistha-viprabhihitah, Maharaja Ambarisa took advice from
brahmanas who were pure devotees of the Lord, for ordinary brahmanas who are merely learned scholars
or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice.
In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are authorized to make laws for the
welfare of the state, but according to this description of the kingdom of Maharaja Ambarisa, the country
or the world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee brahmanas. Such advisors
or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected
by the ignorant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head
of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee brahmanas in ruling the country,
everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing
can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good
character will automatically follow.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
manorathenasati dhavato bahih
"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the
demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value.
This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material
energy." (Bhag. 5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a Krsna conscious king will become devotees, and
then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens
are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are
guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the
spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration
of Maharaja Ambarisa, as described here.
