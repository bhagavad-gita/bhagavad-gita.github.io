prabhuh--very powerful; pururavase--unto Pururava; utsrjya--delivering; gam--the world; putraya--unto

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world, was sufficiently old, he
delivered the entire kingdom to his son Pururava and entered the forest.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varna and asrama must leave his family life
after he reaches fifty years of age (pancasad urdhvam vanam vrajet). Thus Sudyumna followed the
prescribed regulations of varnasrama by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his
spiritual life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman."
Chapter Two
The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu
This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karusa.
After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being
desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like
Maharaja Iksvaku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, Prsadhra, was engaged in the
duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he
would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the
cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger.
Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the
tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth
in a sudra family, but Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material
body and going back home, back to Godhead.
Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his
very childhood. From Manu's son known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Karusas was generated.
Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of ksatriyas was generated, but although
they were born of one who had the qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas. From Nrga, another
son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhutajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in
succession, came Pratika, and from him came Oghavan. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of
Narisyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvan, Purna, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satyasrava,
Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya. From the ksatriya known as Agnivesya came the celebrated brahmana
dynasty known as Agnivesyayana. From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another son of Manu, came
Nabhaga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapriti, Pramsu, Pramati, Khanitra, Caksusa,
Vivimsati, Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama, Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara,
Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha and Trnabindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born
in this dynasty. From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom Kuvera took birth.
Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visala, Sunyabandhu and Dhumraketu. The son of Visala was
Hemacandra, his son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama. The sons of Samyama were Devaja and
Krsasva. Krsasva's son, Somadatta, performed an Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to
Godhead.
