<h2>Text</h2>
sa vai ratnam tu tad drstva
atmaisvaryatisayanam
tan nadriyatagnihotryam
sabhilasah sahaihayah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Kartaviryarjuna); vai--indeed; ratnam--a great source of wealth; tu--indeed; tat--the kamadhenu
in the possession of Jamadagni; drstva--by observing; atma-aisvarya--his own personal opulence; atisayanam--
which was exceeding; tat--that; na--not; adriyata--appreciated very much; agnihotryam--in that
cow, which was useful for executing the agnihotra sacrifice; sa-abhilasah--became desirous; sa-haihayah--
with his own men, the Haihayas.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kartaviryarjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy than himself because of
possessing a jewel in the form of the kamadhenu. Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not
very much appreciative of Jamadagni's reception. On the contrary, they wanted to possess that
kamadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Jamadagni was more powerful than Kartaviryarjuna because of performing the agnihotra-yajna with
clarified butter received from the kamadhenu. Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow.
Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient
milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and clarified ghee, especially for performing the
agnihotra-yajna. This is possible for everyone. Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advises goraksya,
the protection of cows. This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely
supply sufficient milk. We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are
giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk. In other farms the cows do
not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill
them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this instruction given by Lord Krsna--goraksya--
is extremely meaningful. The whole world must learn from Krsna how to live happily without
scarcity simply by producing food grains (annad bhavanti bhutani) and giving protection to the cows (goraksya).
Krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam. Those who belong to the third level of
human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving
protection to cows. This is the injunction of Bhagavad-gita. In the matter of protecting the cows, the meateaters
will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Krsna gives stress to cow protection,
those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and
sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement
of human society.
