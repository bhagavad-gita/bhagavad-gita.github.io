<h2>Translation</h2>
The King said: "To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the brahmanas is certainly a great
offense. On the other hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvadasi,
there is a flaw in one's observance of the vow. Therefore, O brahmanas, if you think that it will be
auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water." In this way, after consulting with
the brahmanas, the King reached this decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may
be accepted as eating and also as not eating.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Maharaja Ambarisa, in his dilemma, consulted the brahmanas about whether he should break the
fast or wait for Durvasa Muni, apparently they could not give a definite answer about what to do. A
Vaisnava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore Maharaja Ambarisa himself decided, in
the presence of the brahmanas, that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was
broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a brahmana. In the Vedas it is said, apo 'snati tan
naivasitam naivanasitam. This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as
eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering
to satyagraha will not eat but will drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating,
Maharaja Ambarisa decided to act in this way.
