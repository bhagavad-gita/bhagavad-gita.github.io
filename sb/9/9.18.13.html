<h2>Text</h2>
yat prthivyam vrihi-yavam
hiranyam pasavah striyah
na duhyanti manah-pritim
pumsah kama-hatasya te
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--what; prthivyam--within this world; vrihi--food grains, rice; yavam--barley; hiranyam--gold;
pasavah--animals; striyah--wives or other women; na duhyanti--do not give; manah-pritim--satisfaction of
the mind; pumsah--to a person; kama-hatasya--because of being victimized by lusty desires; te--they.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A person who is lusty cannot satisfy his mind even if he has enough of everything in this world,
including rice, barley and other food grains, gold, animals and women. Nothing can satisfy him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Improvement of one's economic condition is the aim and object of a materialist, but there is no end to
this material advancement, for if one cannot control his lusty desires, he will never be pleased, even if he
gets all the material wealth of the world. In this age we see much material improvement, but still people
are struggling to get more and more material opulence. Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati.
Although every living entity is a part of the Supreme Being, because of lusty desires one continuously
struggles for so-called betterment of one's economic condition. To have a satisfied mind, one must give up
his heart disease of lusty desires. This can be done only when one is Krsna conscious.
bhaktim param bhagavati pratilabhya kamam
hrd-rogam asv apahinoty acirena dhirah
(Bhag. 10.33.39)
If one becomes Krsna conscious, then he can give up this heart disease; otherwise this disease of lusty
desires will continue, and one cannot have peace in his mind.
