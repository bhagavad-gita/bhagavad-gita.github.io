<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bhagiratha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional service and are therefore in the renounced
order, free from material desires, and who are pure devotees, expert in following the regulative principles
mentioned in the Vedas, are always glorious and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls.
When such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions accumulated from other people will
certainly be counteracted, for such devotees always keep in the core of their hearts the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who can vanquish all sinful reactions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing. Therefore, not only will sinful persons bathe in the
Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees
will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the renounced order
can deliver even the Ganges. Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gadabhrta (Bhag. 1.13.10). Because
saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy
places of all sinful reactions. Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly persons.
It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaisnava, or even a sannyasi, one should immediately offer respects
to such a holy man. If one forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is
a Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing offenses at the lotus feet of
a devotee or saintly person.
There are methods of prayascitta, or atonement, but they are inadequate to cleanse one of sinful
reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the
history of Ajamila:
kecit kevalaya bhaktya
vasudeva-parayanah
agham dhunvanti kartsnyena
niharam iva bhaskarah
"Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the
weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging
devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays." (Bhag. 6.1.15) If one is under
the protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process of bhakti-yoga one is
certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions.
