<h2>Translation</h2>
Long, long ago, Jyamagha had satisfied the demigods and Pitas by worshiping them. Now, by their
mercy, Jyamagha's words came true. Although Saibya was barren, by the grace of the demigods she
became pregnant and in due course of time gave birth to a child named Vidarbha. Before the child's birth,
the girl had been accepted as a daughter-in-law, and therefore Vidarbha actually married her when he
grew up.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayati."
Chapter Twenty-four
Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Vidarbha had three sons, named Kusa, Kratha and Romapada. Of these three, Romapada expanded his
dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Krti, Usika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became
kings. From the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from whose dynasty came the
descendants named Vrsni, Nirvrti, Dasarha, Vyoma, Jimuta, Vikrti, Bhimaratha, Navaratha, Dasaratha,
Sakuni, Karambhi, Devarata, Devaksatra, Madhu, Kuruvasa, Anu, Puruhotra, Ayu and Satvata. Satvata had
seven sons. One of them was Devavrdha, whose son was Babhru. Another son of Satvata was Mahabhoja,
by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated. Another was Vrsni, who had a son named Yudhajit. From
Yudhajit came Anamitra and Sini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Sini. The descendants in
succession from Sini were Satyaka, Yuyudhana, Jaya, Kuni and Yugandhara. Another son of Anamitra was
Vrsni. From Vrsni came Svaphalka, by whom Akrura and twelve other sons were generated. From Akrura
came two sons, named Devavan and Upadeva. The son of Andhaka named Kukura was the origin of the
descendants known as Vahni, Viloma, Kapotaroma, Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Avidyota, Punarvasu and
Ahuka. Ahuka had two sons, named Devaka and Ugrasena. The four sons of Devaka were known as
Devavan, Upadeva, Sudeva and Devavardhana, and his seven daughters were Dhrtadeva, Santideva,
Upadeva, Srideva, Devaraksita, Sahadeva and Devaki. Vasudeva married all seven daughters of Devaka.
Ugrasena had nine sons named Kamsa, Sunama, Nyagrodha, Kanka, Sanku, Suhu, Rastrapala, Dhrsti and
Tustiman, and he had five daughters named Kamsa, Kamsavati, Kanka, Surabhu and Rastrapalika. The
younger brothers of Vasudeva married all the daughters of Ugrasena.
Viduratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Sura, who had ten other sons, of whom Vasudeva was
the chief. Sura gave one of his five daughters, Prtha, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named
Kunti. In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karna, and later she married Maharaja Pandu.
Vrddhasarma married the daughter of Sura named Srutadeva, from whose womb Dantavakra was born.
Dhrstaketu married Sura's daughter named Srutakirti, who had five sons. Jayasena married Sura's
daughter named Rajadhidevi. The king of Cedi-desa, Damaghosa, married the daughter of Sura named
Srutasrava, from whom Sisupala was born.
Devabhaga, through the womb of Kamsa, begot Citraketu and Brhadbala; and Devasrava, through the
womb of Kamsavati, begot Suvira and Isuman. From Kanka, through the womb of Kanka, came Baka,
Satyajit and Purujit, and from Srnjaya, through the womb of Rastrapalika, came Vrsa and Durmarsana.
Syamaka, through the womb of Surabhumi, begot Harikesa and Hiranyaksa. Vatsaka, through the womb
of Misrakesi, begot Vrka, who begot the sons named Taksa, Puskara and Sala. From Samika came Sumitra
and Arjunapala, and from Anaka came Rtadhama and Jaya.
Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaki and Rohini were the most important. From the womb of
Rohini, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, Sarana, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Krta and others.
Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devaki
was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons.
This chapter ends by glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vasudeva.
