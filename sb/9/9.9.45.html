<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
devaih kama-varo datto
mahyam tri-bhuvanesvaraih
na vrne tam aham kamam
bhutabhavana-bhavanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devaih--by the demigods; kama-varah--the benediction to have whatever he wanted; dattah--was given;
mahyam--unto me; tri-bhuvana-isvaraih--by the demigods, the protectors of the three worlds (who can do
whatever they like within this material world); na vrne--did not accept; tam--that; aham--I; kamam--
everything desirable within this material world; bhutabhavana-bhavanah--being fully absorbed in the
Supreme Personality of Godhead (and therefore not interested in anything material).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods, the directors of the three worlds, wanted to give me whatever benediction I desired. I did
not want their benedictions, however, because I am interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who created everything in this material world. I am more interested in the Supreme Personality of
Godhead than in all material benedictions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee is always transcendentally situated. param drstva nivartate: one who has seen the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is no longer interested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee
as Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction. He said, svamin krtartho
'smi varam na yace: "My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me.
I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service." This is the
mentality of a pure devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of
Godhead. Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore called krsna-bhavanamrta-sangha, the
association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Krsna. Being absorbed in thoughts of Krsna
is neither expensive nor troublesome. Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam
namaskuru: "Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me." (Bg. 9.34)
Anyone can always think of Krsna, without difficulties or obstacles. This is called krsna-bhavanamrta.
One who is absorbed in krsna-bhavanamrta has no material benefits to ask from Krsna. Instead, such a
person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories all over the world. Mama
janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. A Krsna conscious person does not even want to
stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, "I may take birth as You like, but my only prayer is that
I may be engaged in Your service."
