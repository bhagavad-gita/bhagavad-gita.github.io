Chapter Four
Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni
This chapter describes the history of Maharaja Nabhaga, of his son Nabhaga, and of Maharaja Ambarisa.
The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Nabhaga lived for many years in the gurukula. In Nabhaga's
absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among
themselves. When Nabhaga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but
when Nabhaga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him
that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and
describe two mantras to be chanted there. Nabhaga executed the order of his father, and thus Angira and
other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice. To test Nabhaga, Lord Siva
challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord Siva was satisfied by Nabhaga's behavior, Lord Siva
offered him all the riches.
From Nabhaga was born Ambarisa, the most powerful and celebrated devotee. Maharaja Ambarisa was
the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such
material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence. He
engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This process is called yukta-vairagya, or feasible
renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Because
Maharaja Ambarisa, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great
opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He
constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying
material opulence, he never desired even liberation.
Once Maharaja Ambarisa was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana, observing
the vow of Dvadasi. On Dvadasi, the day after Ekadasi, when he was about to break his Ekadasi fast, the
great mystic yogi Durvasa appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambarisa respectfully
received Durvasa Muni, and Durvasa Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the
Yamuna River at noontime. Because he was absorbed in samadhi, he did not come back very soon.
Maharaja Ambarisa, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water,
in accordance with the advice of learned brahmanas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By
mystic power, Durvasa Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry. When he
returned he began to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his
hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always
the protector of His devotee, and to protect Maharaja Ambarisa, He sent His disc, the Sudarsana cakra,
which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durvasa, who was so envious of
Maharaja Ambarisa. Durvasa fled to Brahmaloka, Sivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could
not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarsana cakra. Finally he went to the spiritual world and
surrendered to Lord Narayana, but Lord Narayana could not excuse a person who had offended a
Vaisnava. To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaisnava whom he has offended.
There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord Narayana advised Durvasa to return to Maharaja
Ambarisa and beg his pardon.
