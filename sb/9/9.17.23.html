<h2>Text</h2>
yayatir anabhipretam
daivopahrtam atmanah
manas tu tad-gatam buddhva
pratijagraha tad-vacah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yayatih--King Yayati; anabhipretam--not liked; daiva-upahrtam--brought about by providential
arrangements; atmanah--his personal interest; manah--mind; tu--however; tat-gatam--being attracted to
her; buddhva--by such intelligence; pratijagraha--accepted; tat-vacah--the words of Devayani.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Because such a marriage is not sanctioned by regular scriptures, King
Yayati did not like it, but because it was arranged by providence and because he was attracted by
Devayani's beauty, he accepted her request.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes of the boy and girl who were
to be married. If according to astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect,
the match was called yotaka and the marriage would be accepted. Even fifty years ago, this system was
current in Hindu society. Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl, without
this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place. A person is born in one of three
categories, known as deva-gana, manusya-gana and raksasa-gana. In different parts of the universe there
are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people resemble demigods whereas others
resemble demons. If according to astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a
demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there were calculations of pratiloma and
anuloma. The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy,
whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness. Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find
many divorces. Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly one's marriage
would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great that the wife would
voluntarily die when her husband died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now,
of course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal society. Marriage
now takes place simply by agreement. Dampatye 'bhirucir hetuh (Bhag. 12.2.3). The word abhiruci means
"agreement." If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But when the Vedic
system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce.
