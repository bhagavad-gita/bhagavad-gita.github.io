<h2>Text</h2>
rajyam naicchad yatih pitra
dattam tat-parinamavit
yatra pravistah purusa
atmanam navabudhyate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajyam--the kingdom; na aicchat--did not accept; yatih--the eldest son, Yati; pitra--by his father;
dattam--offered; tat-parinama-vit--knowing the result of becoming powerful as a king; yatra--wherein;
pravistah--having entered; purusah--such a person; atmanam--self-realization; na--not; avabudhyate--will
take seriously and understand.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When one enters the post of king or head of the government, one cannot understand the meaning of
self-realization. Knowing this, Yati, the eldest son of Nahusa, did not accept the power to rule, although it
was offered by his father.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who
are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities. Ksatriyas are generally
endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification,
but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only
the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here
that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one looses the chance for human perfection.
Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears Srimad-Bhagavatam. This hearing is
described as nityam bhagavata-sevaya. Maharaja Pariksit was involved in politics, but because at the end
of his life he heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from Sukadeva Gosvami, he attained perfection very easily. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore suggested:
sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir
ye prayaso 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyam
(Bhag. 10.14.3)
Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears
Srimad-Bhagavatam from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.
