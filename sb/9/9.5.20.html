<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
prito 'smy anugrhito 'smi
tava bhagavatasya vai
darsana-sparsanalapair
atithyenatma-medhasa
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pritah--very much satisfied; asmi--I am; anugrhitah--very much favored; asmi--I am; tava--your;
bhagavatasya--because of your being a pure devotee; vai--indeed; darsana--by seeing you; sparsana--and
touching your feet; alapaih--by talking with you; atithyena--by your hospitality; atma-medhasa--by my
own intelligence.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Durvasa Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King. At first I thought of you as an ordinary
human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that
you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and
talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even a very intelligent man cannot understand the
activities of a pure Vaisnava. Therefore, because Durvasa Muni was a great mystic yogi, he first mistook
Maharaja Ambarisa for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken
observation of a Vaisnava. When Durvasa Muni was persecuted by the Sudarsana cakra, however, his
intelligence developed. Therefore the word atma-medhasa is used to indicate that by his personal
experience he would understand how great a Vaisnava the King was. When Durvasa Muni was chased by
the Sudarsana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, and he was even able to go
to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable
to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarsana cakra. Thus he could understand the influence of a
Vaisnava by personal experience. Durvasa Muni was certainly a great yogi and a very learned brahmana,
but despite his being a real yogi he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaisnava. Therefore it is
said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the
value of a Vaisnava. There is always a possibility for so-called jnanis and yogis to be mistaken when
studying the character of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava can be understood by how much he is favored by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.
