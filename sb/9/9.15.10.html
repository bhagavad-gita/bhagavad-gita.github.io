<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the great sage Rcika returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his
absence, he said to his wife, Satyavati, "You have done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce ksatriya,
able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A brahmana is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar
in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving. A ksatriya, however, is highly qualified when he
is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.42-43).
Because Satyavati, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she
would give birth to a son imbued with the ksatriya spirit. This was undesirable. The son of a brahmana is
generally expected to become a brahmana, but if such a son becomes fierce like a ksatriya, he is
designated according to the description of the four varnas in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam
guna-karma-vibhagasah). If the son of a brahmana does not become like a brahmana, he may be called a
ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing society is not a
person's birth but his qualities and actions.
