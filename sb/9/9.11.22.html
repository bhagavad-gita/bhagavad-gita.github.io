<h2>Text</h2>
sa yaih sprsto 'bhidrsto va
samvisto 'nugato 'pi va
kosalas te yayuh sthanam
yatra gacchanti yoginah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He, Lord Ramacandra; yaih--by which persons; sprstah--touched; abhidrstah--seen; va--either;
samvistah--eating together, lying together; anugatah--followed as servants; api va--even; kosalah--all those
inhabitants of Kosala; te--they; yayuh--departed; sthanam--to the place; yatra--wherein; gacchanti--they
go; yoginah--all the bhakti-yogis.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Ramacandra returned to His abode, to which bhakti-yogis are promoted. This is the place to which
all the inhabitants of Ayodhya went after they served the Lord in His manifest pastimes by offering Him
obeisances, touching His lotus feet, fully observing Him as a fatherlike King, sitting or lying down with
Him like equals, or even just accompanying Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Here this is
confirmed. All the inhabitants of Ayodhya who saw Lord Ramacandra as citizens, served Him as servants,
sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home,
back to Godhead. After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters
that particular universe where Lord Ramacandra or Lord Krsna is engaged in His pastimes. Then, after
being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakata-lila, the devotee is finally promoted to
sanatana-dhama, the supreme abode in the spiritual world. This sanatana-dhama is also mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (paras tasmat tu bhavo 'nyo'vyakto'vyaktat sanatanah). One who enters the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-lila-pravista. To understand clearly why Lord Ramacandra returned, it
is mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the bhakti-yogis go. The
impersonalists misunderstand the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that the Lord entered His
own effulgence and therefore become impersonal. But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are persons.
Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past, they are persons in the present, and
they will continue to be persons even after giving up the body. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.
