<h2>Synonyms</h2>

animals; hatva--killing; kriya-arhanan--suitable for offering to the yajna in the sraddha ceremony;
srantah--when he was fatigued; bubhuksitah--and hungry; virah--the hero; sasam--a rabbit; ca--also; adat--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, Iksvaku's son Vikuksi went to the forest and killed many animals suitable for being offered
as oblations. But when fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is evident that ksatriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be
offered at a particular type of yajna. Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as
sraddha is also a kind of yajna. In this yajna, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered.
However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the Brahmavaivarta
Purana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau panca vivarjayet
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in
sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a
man's begetting children in his brother's wife." The word pala-paitrkam refers to an offering of flesh in
oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age,
Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are sudras, not ksatriyas.
According to Vedic injunctions, however, only ksatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas sudras are allowed
to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kali or similar
demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to
eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is concerned, however,
it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in Bhagavad-gita Krsna personally speaks of go-raksyam, cow
protection. Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the sastra, are allowed
to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given all protection.
