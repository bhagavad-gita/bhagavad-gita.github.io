<h2>Text</h2>
tasmai samvyabhajat so 'nnam
adrtya sraddhayanvitah
harim sarvatra sampasyan
sa bhuktva prayayau dvijah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmai--unto him (the brahmana); samvyabhajat--after dividing, gave his share; sah--he (Rantideva);
annam--the food; adrtya--with great respect; sraddhaya anvitah--and with faith; harim--the Supreme Lord;
sarvatra--everywhere, or in the heart of every living being; sampasyan--conceiving; sah--he; bhuktva--after
eating the food; prayayau--left that place; dvijah--the brahmana.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead everywhere, and in every living
entity, he received the guest with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The brahmana guest
ate his share and then went away.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he
never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be
God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord
both in the brahmana and in the candala. This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord
Himself in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva sva-pake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." A pandita, or learned person, perceives the presence
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become
fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-narayana, or "poor Narayana," Rantideva had no
reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Narayana is present in the heart of one
who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-narayana is a wrong conception. By such
logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be
Narayana. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw
everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunah). It is not that
everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Mayavada philosophy, is
always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.
