<h2>Translation</h2>
The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika. Devapi left the kingdom of his father and went to
the forest, and therefore Santanu became the king. Santanu, who in his previous birth was known as
Mahabhisa, had the ability to transform anyone from old age to youth simply by touching that person
with his hands.

<h2>Translation</h2>
Because the King was able to make everyone happy for sense gratification, primarily by the touch of his
hand, his name was Santanu. Once, when there was no rainfall in the kingdom for twelve years and the
King consulted his learned brahminical advisors, they said, "You are faulty for enjoying the property of
your elder brother. For the elevation of your kingdom and home, you should return the kingdom to him."
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One cannot enjoy sovereignty or perform an agnihotra-yajna in the presence of one's elder brother, or
else one becomes a usurper, known as parivetta.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the brahmanas said this, Maharaja Santanu went to the forest and requested his elder brother
Devapi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects. Previously,
however, Santanu's minister Asvavara had instigated some brahmanas to induce Devapi to transgress the
injunctions of the Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler. The brahmanas deviated
Devapi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore when asked by Santanu he did not agree to
accept the post of ruler. On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen.
Under the circumstances, Santanu again became the king, and Indra, being pleased, showered rains.
Devapi later took to the path of mystic yoga to control his mind and senses and went to the village named
Kalapagrama, where he is still living.

next Satya-yuga, will reestablish the Soma dynasty in this world. From Bahlika [the brother of Santanu]
came a son named Somadatta, who had three sons, named Bhuri, Bhurisrava and Sala. From Santanu,
through the womb of his wife named Ganga, came Bhisma, the exalted, self-realized devotee and learned
scholar.
