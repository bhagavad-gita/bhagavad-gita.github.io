<h2>Text</h2>
smaratam hrdi vinyasya
viddham dandaka-kantakaih
sva-pada-pallavam rama
atma-jyotir agat tatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
smaratam--of persons who always think of Him; hrdi--in the core of the heart; vinyasya--placing;
viddham--pierced; dandaka-kantakaih--by thorns in the forest of Dandakaranya (while Lord Ramacandra
was living there); sva-pada-pallavam--the petals of Mis lotus feet; ramah--Lord Ramacandra; atma-jyotih--
the rays of His bodily luster, known as the brahmajyoti; agat--entered; tatah--beyond the brahmajyoti, or
in His own Vaikuntha planet.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After completing the sacrifice, Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus feet were sometimes pierced by thorns
when He lived in Dandakaranya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him.
Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuntha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for devotees. Sometimes when Lord
Ramacandra wandered in the forest of Dandakaranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon
thinking of this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this
material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord's lotus feet by a thorn. This
was the attitude of the gopis when they thought of Krsna wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains
of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmis,
jnanis or yogis. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord's lotus feet being pricked
by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord's disappearance, for the Lord had to
return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.
The word atma-jyotih is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by jnanis, or monistic
philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord's body.
yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-kotikotisv
asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam
tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of
His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which
displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of
universes." (Brahma-samhita 5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond
the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuntha
planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the
sunshine. Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planets, they go through the
brahmajyoti. The jnanis, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord,
cannot enter the Vaikuntha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after
some time they fall again to this material world. Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho
'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag. 10.2.32). The Vaikuntha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and
therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuntha planets are unless one is a pure devotee.
