<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sva-sarira-agnina--by the fire emanating from their own bodies; tavat--immediately; mahendra--by the
tricks of Indra, the King of heaven; hrta-cetasah--their consciousness having been taken away; mahat--a
great personality; vyatikrama-hatah--defeated by the fault of insulting; bhasmasat--turned to ashes;
abhavan--became; ksanat--immediately.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By the influence of Indra, the King of heaven, the sons of Sagara had lost their intelligence and
disrespected a great personality. Consequently, fire emanated from their own bodies, and they were
immediately burned to ashes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material body is a combination of earth, water, fire, air and ether. There is already fire within the
body, and our practical experience is that the heat of this fire sometimes increases and sometimes
decreases. The fire within the bodies of the sons of Sagara Maharaja became so much hotter that all of
them burned to ashes. The fire's increased heat was due to their misbehavior toward a great personality.
Such misbehavior is called mahad-vyatikrama. They were killed by the fire of their own bodies because of
insulting a great personality.
