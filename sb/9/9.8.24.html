<h2>Text</h2>
prasanta maya-guna-karma-lingam
anama-rupam sad-asad-vimuktam
jnanopadesaya grhita-deham
namamahe tvam purusam puranam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prasanta--O completely peaceful one; maya-guna--the modes of material nature; karma-lingam--
symptomized by fruitive activities; anama-rupam--one who has no material name or form; sat-asatvimuktam--
transcendental to the manifested and nonmanifested modes of material nature; jnanaupadesaya--
for distributing transcendental knowledge (as in Bhagavad-gita); grhita-deham--has assumed a
form like a material body; namamahe--I offer my respectful obeisances; tvam--unto You; purusam--the
Supreme Person; puranam--the original.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O completely peaceful Lord, although material nature, fruitive activities and their consequent material
names and forms are Your creation, You are unaffected by them. Therefore, Your transcendental name is
different from material names, and Your form is different from material forms. You assume a form
resembling a material body just to give us instructions like those of Bhagavad-gita, but actually You are
the supreme original person. I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Yamunacarya has recited this verse in his Stotra-ratna (43):
bhavantam evanucaran nirantarah
prasanta-nihsesa-manorathantarah
kadaham aikantika-nitya-kinkarah
praharsayisyami sanatha-jivitam
"By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is completely pacified. When shall
I engage as Your permanent eternal servant and always feel joyful to have such a fitting master?"
Manorathenasati dhavato bahih: one who acts on the mental platform must descend to material
activities. Material contamination, however, is completely absent from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and His pure devotee. Therefore the Lord is addressed as prasanta, completely peaceful, free
from the disturbances of material existence. The Supreme Lord has no material name or form; only the
foolish think that the Lord's name and form are material (avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum
asritam). The identity of the Supreme Lord is that He is the original person. Nonetheless, those who have
but a poor fund of knowledge think that the Lord is formless. The Lord is formless in the material sense,
but He has His transcendental form (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha).
