<h2>Translation</h2>
Being pleased by the full surrender and submission of Lord Bharata, Lord Ramacandra then accepted the
throne of the state. He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in
their occupational duties of varna and asrama, accepted Him as their father.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
People are very fond of the pattern of Rama-rajya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party
called Rama-rajya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Rama. It is sometimes said that
people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good
government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that
exemplified by Lord Ramacandra and His citizens. Lord Ramacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a
father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord
Ramacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the
government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well
trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good
care of the children. As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-nirata varnasrama-gunan-vitah, the
people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of varna and asrama, which arranges
society in the varna divisions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra and the asrama divisions of
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. This is actual human civilization. People must be
trained according to the different varnasrama occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.13),
catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four varnas must be established according to
varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that it must institute this
varnasrama system. The purpose of varnasrama is to enable people to become God conscious.
Varnasramacaravata purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate. The entire varnasrama scheme is intended
to enable people to become Vaisnavas. Visnur asya devata. When people worship Lord Visnu as the
Supreme Lord, they become Vaisnavas. Thus people should be trained to become Vaisnavas through the
system of varna and asrama, as they were during the reign of Lord Ramacandra, when everyone was fully
trained to follow the varnasrama principles.
Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible.
Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the
citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be
trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or
specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students
to become brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis. This
will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (varnasrama-gunan-vitah). Generally
speaking, if the king or president is a rajarsi, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive
will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and
rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the varnasrama system is neglected, people are
generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money
from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But
here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Ramacandra. If people follow
this example, there will be good government all over the world.
