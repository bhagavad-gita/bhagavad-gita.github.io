<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--King Khatvanga who; devaih--by the demigods; arthitah--being requested; daityan--the demons;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Khatvanga was unconquerable in any fight. Requested by the demigods to join them in fighting the
demons, he won victory, and the demigods, being very pleased, wanted to give him a benediction. The
King inquired from them about the duration of his life and was informed that he had only one moment
more. Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence, where he engaged his mind
fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The example of Maharaja Khatvanga in performing devotional service is brilliant. Maharaja Khatvanga
engaged himself for only a moment in devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to
Godhead. Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life, surely he will
return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (asamsaya).
In Bhagavad-gita the word asamsaya is used to describe the devotee. There the Lord Himself gives this
instruction:
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
"Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind
attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." (Bg. 7.1)
The Lord also instructs:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." (Bg. 4.9)
Therefore, from the very beginning of one's life one should practice bhakti-yoga, which increases one's
attachment for Krsna. If one daily sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity,
chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities of the Lord
as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to Krsna. This attachment is called asakti. When one's
mind is attached to Krsna (mayy asakta-manah), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth. If
one misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle
of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and the chance to return home,
back to Godhead. The most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving
service to the Lord.
