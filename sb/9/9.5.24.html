<h2>Translation</h2>
After one year, when Durvasa Muni had returned, King Ambarisa sumptuously fed him all varieties of
pure food, and then he himself also ate. When the King saw that the brahmana Durvasa had been released
from the great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was
also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been done by the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is certainly always busy in many activities. Of course, this material
world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Maharaja Ambarisa. He was the
emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were
many disturbances created by persons like Durvasa Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently
depending fully on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord, however, is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya
caham hrdi sannivistah), and He manages things as He desires. Thus although Maharaja Ambarisa was
faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end
Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa became great friends and parted cordially on the basis of bhaktiyoga.
After all, Durvasa Muni was convinced of the power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great
mystic yogi. Therefore, as stated by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." Thus it is a fact that a devotee
is the topmost yogi, as proved in the dealings of Maharaja Ambarisa with Durvasa Muni.
