<h2>Text</h2>
kamam prayahi jahi visravaso 'vameham
trailokya-ravanam avapnuhi vira patnim
badhnihi setum iha te yasaso vitatyai
gayanti dig-vijayino yam upetya bhupah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kamam--as You like; prayahi--You may go over my water; jahi--just conquer; visravasah--of Visrava
Muni; avameham--pollution, like urine; trailokya--for the three worlds; ravanam--the person known as
Ravana, the cause of weeping; avapnuhi--regain; vira--O great hero; patnim--Your wife; badhnihi--just
construct; setum--a bridge; iha--here (on this water); te--of Your good self; yasasah--fame; vitatyai--to

(bridge); upetya--coming near; bhupah--great kings.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of Ravana,
who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds. He is the son of Visrava, but is
condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sitadevi. O great hero, although my
water presents no impediment to Your going to Lanka, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your
transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes
and kings in the future will glorify You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source--the genitals. When a son is a devotee or a
great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified
and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here Ravana is compared to urine because he
was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord
Ramacandra.
One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra is omnipotence. The Lord can act
without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme
personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He
constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some
artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into
selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord Ramacandra,
however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of God's
uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying
extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord
Ramacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept
Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only
seven years old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays
special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." The activities of
the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed by any
other living being. The symptoms of the Lord's activities are all mentioned in the sastras, and after one
understands them one can accept the Lord as He is.
