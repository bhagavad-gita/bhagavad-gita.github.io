<h2>Text</h2>
tenayajata yajnesam
bhagavantam adhoksajam
urvasi-lokam anvicchan
sarva-devamayam harim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tena--by generating such a fire; ayajata--he worshiped; yajna-isam--the master or enjoyer of the yajna;
bhagavantam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhoksajam--beyond the perception of the senses;
urvasi-lokam--to the planet where Urvasi was staying; anvicchan--although desiring to go; sarva-devamayam--
the reservoir of all demigods; harim--the Supreme personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By means of that fire, Pururava, who desired to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, performed a
sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of
sacrifice. Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of
all the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: any loka, or planet, to
which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the
performance of sacrifice. The purpose of yajna is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this
age, as we have explained many times, the yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only
sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material
or spiritual. Bhagavad-gita (3.14) also says, yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by offering sacrifices to Lord Visnu,
one can have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce
everything (sama-kama-dugha mahi). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of
life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything one gets for material
wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, sarva-kama-dugha mahi (Bhag. 1.10.4).
Everything is possible by performing yajna. Therefore although Pururava desired something material, he
factually performed yajna to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is adhoksaja, beyond
the perception of Pururava and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yajna must be performed to
fulfill the desires of the living entity. Yajnas can be performed in human society only when society is
divided by varnasrama-dharma into four varnas and four asramas. Without such a regulative process, no
one can perform yajnas, and without the performance of yajnas, no material plans can make human
society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajnas. In this age of Kali, the
yajna recommended is sankirtana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.
This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.
