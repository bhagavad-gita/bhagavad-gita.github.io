<h2>Text</h2>
tah sva-patyur maharaja
niriksyadhyatmikim gatim
anviyus tat-prabhavena
agnim santam ivarcisah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tah--all the wives of Saubhari; sva-patyuh--with their own husband; maharaja--O King Pariksit;
niriksya--observing; adhyatmikim--spiritual; gatim--progress; anviyuh--followed; tat-prabhavena--by the
influence of their husband (although they were unfit, by the influence of their husband they also could go
to the spiritual world); agnim--the fire; santam--completely merged; iva--like; arcisah--the flames.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, by observing their husband progressing in spiritual existence, Saubhari Muni's
wives were also able to enter the spiritual world by his spiritual power, just as the flames of a fire cease
when the fire is extinguished.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te 'pi yanti param gatim. Women are not
considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a
suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the
same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the
spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were faithful
followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a
faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically
get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Downfall of Saubhari Muni."
Chapter Seven
The Descendants of King Mandhata
In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in this connection the histories of
Purukutsa and Hariscandra are also given.
The most prominent son of Mandhata was Ambarisa, his son was Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva's son was
Harita. These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata. Purukutsa, another son of
Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named Narmada. The son of Purukutsa was
Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaranya. Anaranya's son was Haryasva, Haryasva's son was Praruna,
Praruna's son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana's son was Satyavrata, also known as Trisanku. When
Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trisanku
became a candala, worse than a sudra. Later, by the influence of Visvamitra, he was brought to the
heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall,
however, by the influence of Visvamitra. The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra. Hariscandra once
performed a Rajasuya-yajna, but Visvamitra cunningly took all of Hariscandra's possessions as a daksina
contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between
Visvamitra and Vasistha. Hariscandra had no sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and
in this way got a son named Rohita. Hariscandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a
Varuna-yajna. Varuna reminded Hariscandra repeatedly about this yajna, but the King, because of
affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and gradually the
son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest.
Meanwhile, at home, Hariscandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna. When Rohita
received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra
prevented him from doing so. Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years
and then returned home. Rohita purchased Sunahsepha, the second son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his
father, Hariscandra, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the
other demigods were pacified, and Hariscandra was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, Visvamitra was
the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata. King
Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariscandra a golden chariot, and Visvamitra gave him
transcendental knowledge. Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes how Hariscandra achieved perfection.
