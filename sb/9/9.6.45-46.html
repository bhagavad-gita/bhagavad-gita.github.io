<h2>Translation</h2>
Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe austerities resulted in an
opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants,
and varieties of parks with clear-water lakes and gardens. In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of flowers,
birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers. Saubhari Muni's home was amply
provided with valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of
sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes. Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia, the
muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Saubhari Rsi was a great yogi. Yogic perfection makes available eight material opulences--anima,
laghima, mahima, prapti, prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita. Saubhari Muni exhibited superexcellence
in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection. The word bahv-rca means "expert in
chanting mantras." As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be
achieved by subtle means through mantras. By chanting mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged for material
opulence, but this was not perfection in life. As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with
material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the vanaprastha order and achieved
final success. Those who are not atma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be
satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are atma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material
opulence. This is the instruction we can derive from the life and activities of Saubhari Muni.
