<h2>Text</h2>
sri-badarayanir uvaca
puror vamsam pravaksyami
yatra jato 'si bharata
yatra rajarsayo vamsya
brahma-vamsyas ca jajnire
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-badarayanih uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; puroh vamsam--the dynasty of Maharaja Puru;
pravaksyami--now I shall narrate; yatra--in which dynasty; jatah asi--you were born; bharata--O Maharaja
Pariksit, descendant of Maharaja Bharata; yatra--in which dynasty; raja-rsayah--all the kings were saintly;
vamsyah--one after another; brahma-vamsyah--many brahmana dynasties; ca--also; jajnire--grew up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: O Maharaja Pariksit, descendant of Maharaja Bharata, I shall now describe the
dynasty of Puru, in which you were born, in which many saintly kings appeared, and from which many
dynasties of brahmanas began.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from ksatriyas many brahmanas
have been born and that from brahmanas many ksatriyas have been born. The Lord Himself says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to the three modes
of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by
Me." Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the
symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly. Yal-laksanam proktam. One's place in
the varna divisions of society is determined according to one's symptoms or qualities. This is maintained
everywhere in the sastra. Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one's qualities and
activities.
