<h2>Text</h2>
tam tyaktu-kamam mamatam
bhartus tyaga-visankitam
nama-nirvacanam tasya
slokam enam sura jaguh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--that newly born baby; tyaktu-kamam--who was trying to avoid; mamatam--unto Mamata; bhartuh
tyaga-visankitam--very much afraid of being forsaken by her husband because of giving birth to an
illegitimate son; nama-nirvacanam--a name-giving ceremony, or nama-karana; tasya--to the child;
slokam--verse; enam--this; surah--the demigods; jaguh--enunciated.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Mamata very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and
therefore she considered giving up the child. But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a
name for the child.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as jata-karma
and nama-karana, in which learned brahmanas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope
according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamata gave birth was begotten by
Brhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamata was the wife of Utathya, Brhaspati made her pregnant by
force. Therefore Brhaspati became bharta. According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of
her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dvaja. The common word still current in Hindu society
for such a son is dogla, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a
situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamata,
therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvaja, which
indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamata and Brhaspati.
