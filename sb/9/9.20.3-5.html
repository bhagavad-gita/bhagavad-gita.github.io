<h2>Translation</h2>
Rantideva never endeavored to earn anything. He would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of
providence, but when guests came he would give them everything. Thus he underwent considerable
suffering, along with the members of his family. Indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of
food and water, yet Rantideva always remained sober. Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the
morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and
his family were about to eat, a brahmana guest arrived.
