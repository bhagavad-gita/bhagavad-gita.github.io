<h2>Text</h2>
rajno murdhabhisiktasya
vadho brahma-vadhad guruh
tirtha-samsevaya camho
jahy angacyuta-cetanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajnah--of the king; murdha-abhisiktasya--who is noted as the emperor; vadhah--the killing; brahmavadhat--
than killing a brahmana; guruh--more severe; tirtha-samsevaya--by worshiping the holy places;
ca--also; amhah--the sinful act; jahi--wash out; anga--O my dear son; acyuta-cetanah--being fully Krsna
conscious.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely sinful than killing a brahmana. But now,
if you become Krsna conscious and worship the holy places, you can atone for this great sin.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed from all sins (aham tvam
sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami). From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Sri Krsna, even the
most sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Parasurama to worship
the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be
released from sinful reactions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Parasurama, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation."
Chapter Sixteen
Lord Parasurama Destroys the World's Ruling Class
When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described in this chapter, Parasurama rid
the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times. This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.
When Jamadagni's wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the
Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate
with him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband. Parasurama killed his mother
and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of
Kartaviryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord
Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was
meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Parasurama returned to the asrama and saw his
father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out
with determination to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world. Taking up his axe, he went to
Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and killed all of Kartaviryarjuna's sons, whose blood
became a great river. Parasurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kartaviryarjuna;
later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no
ksatriyas on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, Parasurama joined the head of his father to the dead body
and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body,
and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarsi-mandala. Parasurama, the
son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata. In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of
Vedic knowledge.
In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Visvamitra took birth. By dint of his austerity and penance,
he became a brahmana. He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas. In the sacrificial
arena of Hariscandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy
of the Prajapatis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi. The fifty elder
sons of Visvamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder brother, and therefore Visvamitra
cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Visvamitra's fifty-first son, along
with his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Visvamitra,
being satisfied, blessed them. Thus Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently
there are different divisions of that dynasty.
