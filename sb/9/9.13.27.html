<h2>Text</h2>
ete vai maithila rajann
atma-vidya-visaradah
yogesvara-prasadena
dvandvair mukta grhesv api
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ete--all of them; vai--indeed; maithilah--the descendants of Mithila; rajan--O King; atma-vidyavisaradah--
expert in spiritual knowledge; yogesvara-prasadena--by the grace of Yogesvara, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna; dvandvaih muktah--they were all freed from the duality of the material
world; grhesu api--even though staying at home.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King Pariksit, all the kings of the dynasty of Mithila were completely
in knowledge of their spiritual identity. Therefore, even though staying at home, they were liberated from
the duality of material existence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This material world is called dvaita, or duality. The Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 4.176) says:
'dvaite 'bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba----'manodharma'
'ei bhala, ei manda,'----ei saba 'bhrama'
In the world of duality--that is to say, in the material world--so-called goodness and badness are both
the same. Therefore, in this world, to distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is
meaningless because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma). Because everything here is
miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply
illusion. The liberated person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature, is
unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances. He remains Krsna conscious by tolerating so-called
happiness and distress. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkhadah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed."
Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not
care about so-called happiness and distress. They know that these are like changing seasons, which are
perceivable by contact with the material body. Happiness and distress come and go. Therefore a pandita, a
learned man, is not concerned with them. As it is said, gatasun agatasums ca nanusocanti panditah. The
body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and
distress. Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and
distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila
were all liberated persons, unaffected by the so-called happiness and distress of this world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi."
Chapter Fourteen
King Pururava Enchanted by Urvasi
The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter describes Soma and how he
kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Pururava, who
begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvasi.
Lord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Brahma
had a son named Atri, and Atri's son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the
conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who was the wife of
Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the
asuras, but Brahma rescued Brhaspati's wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband,
thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the
womb of Ila a son named Aila, or Pururava. Urvasi was captivated by Pururava's beauty, and therefore she
lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While
traveling all over the world, he met Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only
one night in a year.
One year later, Pururava saw Urvasi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when
he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. Urvasi then advised Pururava to
worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Pururava, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as
Agnisthali. Pururava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi, but while he was wandering in the forest his
misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and
meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire.
Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb
of a sami tree had come an asvattha tree. Pururava made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a
fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Pururava. In Satyayuga
there was only one social division, called hamsa; there were no divisions of varna like brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. The Veda was the omkara. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only
the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.
