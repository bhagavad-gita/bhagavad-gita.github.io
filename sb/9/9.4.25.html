<h2>Text</h2>
samvardhayanti yat kamah
svarajya-paribhavitah
durlabha napi siddhanam
mukundam hrdi pasyatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
samvardhayanti--increase happiness; yat--because; kamah--such aspirations; sva-rajya--situated in his
own constitutional position of rendering service to the Lord; paribhavitah--saturated with such
aspirations; durlabhah--very rarely obtained; na--not; api--also; siddhanam--of the great mystics;
mukundam--Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; hrdi--within the core of the heart; pasyatah--
persons always accustomed to seeing Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such achievements
do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Krsna within the core of
his heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher planetary systems but even in the
perfections of mystic yoga. Real perfection is devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in
the impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic yoga (anima,
laghima, prapti and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee. As stated by Srila Prabodhananda
Sarasvati:
kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
(Caitanya-candramrta 5)
When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord
through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he
regards material happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o'-the-wisp. As far as the perfection of
mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic yogi is
especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the
service of the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate) there is no need for separate control of the
senses. For those who are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee's senses are
all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled. param drstva
nivartate (Bg. 2.59). A devotee's senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the
material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because
everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and material
world is the mentality of service. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate. When there is
no mentality of service to the Supreme personality of Godhead, one's activities are material.
prapanci-kataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.256)
That which is not engaged in the service of the Lord is material, and nothing thus engaged should be
given up. In the construction of a high skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the
same enthusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual. Spiritual
activities should not be confused with material activities and given up. Nothing connected with Hari, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is material. A devotee who considers all this is always situated in
spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (param drstva nivartate).
