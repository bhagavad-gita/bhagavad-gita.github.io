<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/9/9.18.24.html">9.18.24</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
asevitam varsa-pugan
sad-vargam visayesu sah
ksanena mumuce nidam
jata-paksa iva dvijah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asevitam--being always engaged in; varsa-pugan--for many, many years; sat-vargam--the six senses,
including the mind; visayesu--in sense enjoyment; sah--King Yayati; ksanena--within a moment;
mumuce--gave up; nidam--nest; jata-paksah--one that has grown its wings; iva--like; dvijah--a bird.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having enjoyed sense gratification for many, many years, O King Pariksit, Yayati was accustomed to it,
but he gave it up entirely in a moment, just as a bird flies away from the nest as soon as its wings have
grown.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That Maharaja Yayati was immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life is certainly
astonishing. But the example given herewith is appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father
and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly, if one
fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of
conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami). As stated
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye 'nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
"Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha, Yavana and the Khasa races and even others
addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme
power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." Lord Visnu is so powerful that He can deliver
anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, can
be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Maharaja Yayati did.
Maharaja Yayati was eager to serve Vasudeva, Krsna, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce
material life, Lord Vasudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves
unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned
life. This is clearly expressed in the next verse.
