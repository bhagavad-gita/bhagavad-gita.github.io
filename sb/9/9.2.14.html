<h2>Text</h2>
evam vrtto vanam gatva
drstva davagnim utthitam
tenopayukta-karano
brahma prapa param munih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam vrttah--being situated in such an order of life; vanam--to the forest; gatva--after going; drstva--
when he saw; dava-agnim--a forest fire; utthitam--existing there; tena--by that (fire); upayukta-karanah--
engaging all the senses of the body by burning; brahma--transcendence; prapa--he achieved; param--the
ultimate goal; munih--as a great saintly person.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
With this attitude, Prsadhra became a great saint, and when he entered the forest and saw a blazing
forest fire, he took this opportunity to burn his body in the fire. Thus he achieved the transcendental,
spiritual world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Prsadhra,
because of his karma, was cursed to take his next birth as a sudra, but because he took to saintly life,
specifically concentrating his mind always upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a pure
devotee. Immediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (mam eti), as a result of his devotional situation. Devotional service performed by thinking
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although Prsadhra was cursed he avoided the
terrible consequence of becoming a sudra and instead returned home, back to Godhead. As stated in
Brahma-samhita (5.54):
yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karmabandhanurupa-
phala-bhajanam atanoti
karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of their material activities.
Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe up to the King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of
karma. A pure devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from these laws.
