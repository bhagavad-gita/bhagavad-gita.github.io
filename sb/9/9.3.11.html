<h2>Text</h2>
kasyacit tv atha kalasya
nasatyav asramagatau
tau pujayitva provaca
vayo me dattam isvarau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kasyacit--after some (time); tu--but; atha--in this way; kalasya--time having passed; nasatyau--the two
Asvini-kumaras; asrama--that place of Cyavana Muni; agatau--reached; tau--unto those two; pujayitva--
offering respectful obeisances; provaca--said; vayah--youth; me--unto me; dattam--please give; isvarau--
because you two are able to do so.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, some time having passed, the Asvini-kumara brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to
come to Cyavana Muni's asrama. After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them
to give him youthful life, for they were able to do so.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The heavenly physicians like the Asvini-kumaras could give youthful life even to one who was advanced
in age. Indeed, great yogis, with their mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the
structure of the body is in order. We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Maharaja's
soldiers and their treatment by Sukracarya. Modern medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a
dead body back to life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we can understand
that such treatment is possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information. The Asvinikumaras
were expert in Ayur-veda, as was Dhanvantari. In every department of material science, there is a
perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection
is to become a devotee of the Lord. To attain this perfection, one must consult Srimad-Bhagavatam, which
is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam).
