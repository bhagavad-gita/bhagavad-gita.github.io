<h2>Translation</h2>
Angada and the other commanders of the soldiers of Ramacandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses
and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows. Thus the
soldiers of Lord Ramacandra killed Ravana's soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Ravana had
been condemned by the anger of mother Sita.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The soldiers Lord Ramacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and did not have proper
equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Ravana, for Ravana's soldiers were equipped with weapons
of modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees. It was only
Lord Ramacandra and Laksmana who shot some arrows. But because the soldiers of Ravana were
condemned by the curse of mother Sita, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by throwing stones
and trees. There are two kinds of strength--daiva and purusakara. Daiva refers to the strength achieved
from the Transcendence, and purusakara refers to the strength organized by one's own intelligence and
power. Transcendental power is always superior to the power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy
of the Supreme Lord, one must fight one's enemies even though one may not be equipped with modern
weapons. Therefore Krsna instructed Arjuna, mam anusmara yudhya ca: "Think of Me and fight." We
should fight our enemy to the best of our ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
