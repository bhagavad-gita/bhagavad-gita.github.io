samana-silesu visrjya dhirah
vanam vivesatmani vasudeve
mano dadhad dhvasta-guna-pravahah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; atha--in this way; ambarisah--King Ambarisa; tanayesu--
unto his sons; rajyam--the kingdom; samana-silesu--who were equally as qualified as their father; visrjya--
dividing; dhirah--the most learned person, Maharaja Ambarisa; vanam--into the forest; vivesa--entered;

dadhat--concentrating; dhvasta--vanquished; guna-pravahah--the waves of the material modes of nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, because of his advanced position in devotional life,
Maharaja Ambarisa, who no longer desired to live with material things, retired from active family life. He
divided his property among his sons, who were equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of
vanaprastha and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord Vasudeva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa was liberated in any condition of life because, as enunciated by
Srila Rupa Gosvami, a devotee is always liberated.
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Rupa Gosvami thus instructs that if one's only desire is service to the
Lord, he is liberated in any condition of life. Maharaja Ambarisa was undoubtedly liberated in any
condition, but as an ideal king he accepted the vanaprastha order of retirement from family life. It is
essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Vasudeva.
Therefore Maharaja Ambarisa divided the kingdom among his sons and retired from family life.
