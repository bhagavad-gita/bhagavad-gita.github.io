<h2>Text</h2>
tasma adad dharis cakram
pratyanika-bhayavaham
ekanta-bhakti-bhavena
prito bhaktabhiraksanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmai--unto him (Ambarisa Maharaja); adat--gave; harih--the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
cakram--His disc; pratyanika-bhaya-avaham--the Lord's disc, which was extremely fearful to the enemies
of the Lord and His devotees; ekanta-bhakti-bhavena--because of his performing unalloyed devotional
service; pritah--the Lord being so pleased; bhakta-abhiraksanam--for the protection of His devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being very pleased by the unalloyed devotion of Maharaja Ambarisa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead gave the King His disc, which is fearful to enemies and which always protects the devotee from
enemies and adversities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, may not be expert in self-defense, but
because a devotee fully depends on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is always
sure of protection by the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja said:
naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaranyas
tvad-virya-gayana-mahamrta-magna-cittah
(Bhag. 7.9.43)
A devotee is always merged in the ocean of the transcendental bliss of rendering service to the Lord.
Therefore he is not at all afraid of any adverse situation in the material world. The Lord also promises,
kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O Arjuna, you may declare to the world that the devotees
of the Lord are never vanquished." (Bg. 9.31) For the protection of the devotees, Krsna's disc, the
Sudarsana cakra, is always ready. This disc is extremely fearful to the nondevotees (pratyanikabhayavaham).
Therefore although Maharaja Ambarisa was fully engaged in devotional service, his
kingdom was free of all fear of adversity.
