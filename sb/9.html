saying that when the entire world is inundated, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead exists, and
nothing else. Sukadeva Gosvami will now describe how the Lord creates other things, one after another.

Manu had begun that sacrifice for the sake of getting a son, but because the priest was diverted by the
request of Manu's wife, a daughter named Ila was born. Upon seeing the daughter, Manu was not very
satisfied. Thus he spoke to his guru, Vasistha, as follows.
Because Manu had no issue, he was pleased at the birth of the child, even though a daughter, and gave
her the name Ila. Later, however, he was not very satisfied to see the daughter instead of a son. Because he
had no issue, he was certainly very glad at the birth of Ila, but his pleasure was temporary.

bhagavan--O my lord; kim idam--what is this; jatam--born; karma--fruitive activities; vah--of all of you;
brahma-vadinam--of you, who are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras; viparyayam--deviation; aho--alas;
kastam--painful; ma evam syat--thus it should not have been; brahma-vikriya--this opposite action of the
Vedic mantras.
My lord, all of you are expert in chanting the Vedic mantras. How then has the result been opposite to
the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation. There should not have been such a reversal of the
results of the Vedic mantras.
In this age, the performance of yajna has been forbidden because no one can properly chant the Vedic
mantras. If Vedic mantras are chanted properly, the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be
successful. Therefore the Hare Krsna chant is called the maha-mantra, the great, exalted mantra above all
other Vedic mantras, because simply chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra brings so many beneficial
effects. As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Siksastaka 1):
ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam
sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam
anandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam
sarvatma-snapanam param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam
"Glory to the Sri Krsna sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and
extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death. This sankirtana movement is the
prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life
of all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully
taste the nectar for which we are always anxious."
Therefore, the best performance of yajna given to us is the sankirtana-yajna. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag. 11.5.32). Those who are intelligent take advantage of the greatest yajna in
this age by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in congregation. When the Hare Krsna mantra is
chanted by many men together, the chanting is called sankirtana, and as a result of such a yajna there will
be clouds in the sky (yajnad bhavati parjanyah). In these days of drought, people can gain relief from
scarcity of rain and food by the simple method of the Hare Krsna yajna. Indeed, this can relieve all of
human society. At present there are droughts throughout Europe and America, and people are suffering,
but if people take this Krsna consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful activities and
chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, all their problems will be solved without difficulty. In other processes
of yajna there are difficulties because there are no learned scholars who can chant the mantras perfectly
well, nor is it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the yajna. Because human society is povertystricken
and men are devoid of Vedic knowledge and the power to chant the Vedic mantras, the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra is the only shelter. people should be intelligent enough to chant it. Yajnaih
sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah. Those whose brains are dull cannot understand this chanting,
nor can they take to it.

We have learned from many Vedic literatures that a benediction or curse given by the demigods never
proves false. By performing austerities and penances, by controlling the senses and mind, and by
achieving full knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one is fully cleansed of material contamination. Then
one's words and blessings, like those of the demigods, are never a failure.

Since that time, no male had entered that forest. But now King Sudyumna, having been transformed into
a female, began to walk with his associates from one forest to another.
In Bhagavad-gita (2.22) it is said:
vasamsi jirnani yatha vihaya
navani grhnati naro 'parani
tatha sarirani vihaya jirnany
anyani samyati navani dehi
"As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up
the old and useless ones."
The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved. Sudyumna and his associates were all male, which
means that their souls were covered by male dress, but now they became female, which means that their
dress was changed. The soul, however, remains the same. It is said that by modern medical treatment a
male can be transformed into a female, and a female into a male. The body, however, has no connection
with the soul. The body can be changed, either in this life or the next. Therefore, one who has knowledge
of the soul and how the soul transmigrates from one body to another does not pay attention to the body,
which is nothing but a covering dress. Panditah sama-darsinah. Such a person sees the soul, which is part
and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore he is a sama-darsi, a learned person.

O King Pariksit, Lord Siva was pleased with Vasistha. Therefore, to satisfy him and to keep his own
word to Parvati, Lord Siva said to that saintly person, "Your disciple Sudyumna may remain a male for
one month and a female for the next. In this way he may rule the world as he likes."
The word gotrajah is significant in this connection. Brahmanas generally act as spiritual masters of two
dynasties. One is their disciplic succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen. Both
descendants belong to the same gotra, or dynasty. In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both
brahmanas and ksatriyas and even vaisyas come in the disciplic succession of the same rsis. Because the
gotra and dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the family born of the semen.
The same system still prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra is
calculated. Here the word gotrajah refers to those born in the same dynasty, whether they be disciples or
members of the family.

Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world, was sufficiently old, he
delivered the entire kingdom to his son Pururava and entered the forest.
According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varna and asrama must leave his family life
after he reaches fifty years of age (pancasad urdhvam vanam vrajet). Thus Sudyumna followed the
prescribed regulations of varnasrama by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his
spiritual life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Sudyumna Becomes a Woman."
Chapter Two
The Dynasties of the Sons of Manu
This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karusa.
After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being
desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like
Maharaja Iksvaku, all of whom were like their father. One of these sons, Prsadhra, was engaged in the
duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand. Following the order of his spiritual master, he
would stand in this way for the entire night. Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the
cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger.
Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the
tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow. Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth
in a sudra family, but Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material
body and going back home, back to Godhead.
Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his
very childhood. From Manu's son known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Karusas was generated.
Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of ksatriyas was generated, but although
they were born of one who had the qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas. From Nrga, another
son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhutajyoti and Vasu. From Vasu, in
succession, came Pratika, and from him came Oghavan. Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of
Narisyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvan, Purna, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satyasrava,
Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya. From the ksatriya known as Agnivesya came the celebrated brahmana
dynasty known as Agnivesyayana. From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another son of Manu, came
Nabhaga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapriti, Pramsu, Pramati, Khanitra, Caksusa,
Vivimsati, Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama, Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara,
Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha and Trnabindu. In this way, many sons and grandsons were born
in this dynasty. From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom Kuvera took birth.
Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visala, Sunyabandhu and Dhumraketu. The son of Visala was
Hemacandra, his son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama. The sons of Samyama were Devaja and
Krsasva. Krsasva's son, Somadatta, performed an Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to
Godhead.

One who becomes virasana takes the vow to stand all night with a sword to give protection to the cows.
Because Prsadhra was engaged in this way, it is to be understood that he had no dynasty. We can further
understand from this vow accepted by Prsadhra how essential it is to protect the cows. Some son of a
ksatriya would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even at night. What then is to be
said of sending cows to slaughterhouses? This is the most sinful activity in human society.

It appears that Vasistha was not free from tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance. As the family priest or
spiritual master of Prsadhra, Vasistha should have taken Prsadhra's offense very lightly, but instead
Vasistha cursed him to become a sudra. It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give
him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement. Vasistha, however, did just the opposite.
Therefore Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that he was durmati; in other words, his intelligence
was not very good.

Thereafter, Prsadhra gained relief from all responsibilities, became peaceful in mind, and established
control over all his senses. Being unaffected by material conditions, being pleased with whatever was
available by the grace of the Lord to maintain body and soul together, and being equal toward everyone,
he gave full attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who is the transcendental
Supersoul, free from material contamination. Thus Prsadhra, fully satisfied in pure knowledge, always
keeping his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, achieved pure devotional service to the Lord
and began traveling all over the world, without affection for material activities, as if he were deaf, dumb
and blind.

evam vrtto vanam gatva

engaging all the senses of the body by burning; brahma--transcendence; prapa--he achieved; param--the
ultimate goal; munih--as a great saintly person.
With this attitude, Prsadhra became a great saint, and when he entered the forest and saw a blazing
forest fire, he took this opportunity to burn his body in the fire. Thus he achieved the transcendental,
spiritual world.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Prsadhra,
because of his karma, was cursed to take his next birth as a sudra, but because he took to saintly life,
specifically concentrating his mind always upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he became a pure
devotee. Immediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (mam eti), as a result of his devotional situation. Devotional service performed by thinking
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that although Prsadhra was cursed he avoided the
terrible consequence of becoming a sudra and instead returned home, back to Godhead. As stated in
Brahma-samhita (5.54):
yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karmabandhanurupa-
phala-bhajanam atanoti
karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Those who engage in devotional service are unaffected by the results of their material activities.
Otherwise, everyone, from the smallest microbe up to the King of heaven, Indra, is subject to the laws of
karma. A pure devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, is exempt from these laws.

From the son of Manu named Dhrsta came a ksatriya caste called Dharsta, whose members achieved the
position of brahmanas in this world. Then, from the son of Manu named Nrga came Sumati. From Sumati
came Bhutajyoti, and from Bhutajyoti came Vasu.
Here it is said, ksatram brahma-bhuyam gatam ksitau: although the Dharstas belonged to the ksatriya
caste, they were able to convert themselves into brahmanas. This gives clear evidence supporting the
following statement by Narada (Bhag. 7.11.35):
yasya yal laksanam proktam
pumso varnabhivyanjakam
yad anyatrapi drsyeta

If the qualities of one group are found in the men of another, those men should be recognized by their
qualities, by their symptoms, not by the caste of the family in which they were born. Birth is not at all
important; it is one's qualities that are stressed in all Vedic literature.

Dista had a son by the name Nabhaga. This Nabhaga, who was different from the Nabhaga described
later, became a vaisya by occupational duty. The son of Nabhaga was known as Bhalandana, the son of
Bhalandana was Vatsapriti, and his son was Pramsu. Pramsu's son was Pramati, Pramati's son was
Khanitra, Khanitra's son was Caksusa, and his son was Vivimsati.
From Manu, one son became a ksatriya, another a brahmana, and another a vaisya. This confirms the
statement by Narada Muni, yasya yal laksanam proktam pumso varnabhivyanjakam (Bhag. 7.11.35). One
should always remember that brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas should never be regarded as members of a
caste by birth. A brahmana may be changed into a ksatriya, and a ksatriya into a brahmana. Similarly, a
brahmana or ksatriya may be changed into a vaisya, and a vaisya into a brahmana or ksatriya. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). So one is a brahmana,
ksatriya or vaisya never by birth, but by quality. There is a great need of brahmanas. Therefore, in the
Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train some brahmanas to guide human society. Because
at present there is a scarcity of brahmanas, the brain of human society is lost. Because practically everyone
is a sudra, no one at the present moment can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to
achieve perfection in life.

day of the yajna of the Angirasas. One day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to
the asrama of Cyavana Muni. There Sukanya saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms,
and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances. As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze
from that hole. Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from constipation and inability
to pass urine. When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya
was the cause of this misfortune. Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him
according to his own desire, and Devajna Saryati offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very
old man.
When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the muni
requested them to give him back his youth. These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake,
in which they bathed and regained full youth. After this, Sukanya could not distinguish her husband. She
then surrendered unto the Asvini-kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore
introduced her again to her husband. Cyavana Muni then engaged King Saryati in performing the somayajna
and gave the Asvini-kumaras the privilege to drink soma-rasa. The King of heaven, Lord Indra,
became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati. Henceforward, the Asvini-kumara
physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.
Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and Bhurisena. Anarta had one son, whose
name was Revata. Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi. Kakudmi was advised
by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who belongs to the visnu-tattva
category. After doing this, Kakudmi retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to
execute austerities and penances.

sukanya cyavanam prapya
patim parama-kopanam
prinayam asa citta-jna
apramattanuvrttibhih
sukanya--the girl named Sukanya, the daughter of King Saryati; cyavanam--the great sage Cyavana
Muni; prapya--after obtaining; patim--as her husband; parama-kopanam--who was always very angry;
prinayam asa--she satisfied him; citta-jna--understanding the mind of her husband; apramatta
anuvrttibhih--by executing services without being bewildered.
Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanya had gotten him as her husband, she dealt with him
carefully, according to his mood. Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without being
bewildered.
This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife. A great personality like Cyavana
Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position. Such a person cannot submit to
anyone. Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament. His wife, Sukanya, could understand his
attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly. If any wife wants to be happy with her
husband, she must try to understand her husband's temperament and please him. This is victory for a
woman. Even in the dealings of Lord Krsna with His different queens, it has been seen that although the
queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Krsna as His maidservants.
However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she
must be ready to carry out her husband's orders and please him in all circumstances. Then her life will be
successful. When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or
ultimately completely broken. In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is
broken even by slight incidents. Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws.
According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be
trained to be submissive to the will of her husband. Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for
the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband,
however irritable or cruel he may be. In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not
young but indeed old enough to be Sukanya's grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanya, the
beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all
respects. Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.

Thereafter, some time having passed, the Asvini-kumara brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to
come to Cyavana Muni's asrama. After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them
to give him youthful life, for they were able to do so.
The heavenly physicians like the Asvini-kumaras could give youthful life even to one who was advanced
in age. Indeed, great yogis, with their mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the
structure of the body is in order. We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Maharaja's
soldiers and their treatment by Sukracarya. Modern medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a
dead body back to life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we can understand
that such treatment is possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information. The Asvinikumaras
were expert in Ayur-veda, as was Dhanvantari. In every department of material science, there is a
perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature. The highest perfection
is to become a devotee of the Lord. To attain this perfection, one must consult Srimad-Bhagavatam, which
is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam).

O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You have cheated the most respectable
husband, who is honored by everyone, for I see that because he was old, diseased and therefore
unattractive, you have left his company to accept as your husband this young man, who appears to be a
beggar from the street.
This shows the values of Vedic culture. According to the circumstances, Sukanya had been given a
husband who was too old to be compatible with her. Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he
was certainly unfit for the beautiful daughter of King Saryati. Nonetheless, her father expected her to be
faithful to her husband. When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else, even though
the man was young and handsome, he immediately chastised her as asati, unchaste, because he assumed
that she had accepted another man in the presence of her husband. According to Vedic culture, even if a
young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully serve him. This is chastity. It is not that
because she dislikes her husband she may give him up and accept another. This is against Vedic culture.
According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her parents and remain
chaste and faithful to him. Therefore King Saryati was surprised to see a young man by the side of
Sukanya.

O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in
this way? Mow is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties

It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in
the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father's
family and the family of her husband. The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the
respectable families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas even today; only the sudras are degraded in this
matter. For a woman of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class to accept another husband in the presence
of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable
in the Vedic culture. Therefore King Saryati, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni's
transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.

Chapter Four
Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni
This chapter describes the history of Maharaja Nabhaga, of his son Nabhaga, and of Maharaja Ambarisa.
The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Nabhaga lived for many years in the gurukula. In Nabhaga's
absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among
themselves. When Nabhaga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but
when Nabhaga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him
that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and
describe two mantras to be chanted there. Nabhaga executed the order of his father, and thus Angira and
other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice. To test Nabhaga, Lord Siva
challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord Siva was satisfied by Nabhaga's behavior, Lord Siva
offered him all the riches.
From Nabhaga was born Ambarisa, the most powerful and celebrated devotee. Maharaja Ambarisa was
the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary. Indeed, knowing that such
material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence. He
engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. This process is called yukta-vairagya, or feasible
renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Because
Maharaja Ambarisa, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great
opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom. He
constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord. Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying
material opulence, he never desired even liberation.
Once Maharaja Ambarisa was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana, observing
the vow of Dvadasi. On Dvadasi, the day after Ekadasi, when he was about to break his Ekadasi fast, the
great mystic yogi Durvasa appeared in his house and became his guest. King Ambarisa respectfully
received Durvasa Muni, and Durvasa Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the
Yamuna River at noontime. Because he was absorbed in samadhi, he did not come back very soon.
Maharaja Ambarisa, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water,
in accordance with the advice of learned brahmanas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast. By
mystic power, Durvasa Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry. When he
returned he began to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his
hair a demon appearing like the fire of death. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always
the protector of His devotee, and to protect Maharaja Ambarisa, He sent His disc, the Sudarsana cakra,
which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durvasa, who was so envious of
Maharaja Ambarisa. Durvasa fled to Brahmaloka, Sivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could
not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarsana cakra. Finally he went to the spiritual world and
surrendered to Lord Narayana, but Lord Narayana could not excuse a person who had offended a
Vaisnava. To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaisnava whom he has offended.
There is no other way to be excused. Thus Lord Narayana advised Durvasa to return to Maharaja
Ambarisa and beg his pardon.

learned; yavistham--the youngest; vyabhajan--divided; dayam--the property; brahmacarinam--having
accepted the life of a brahmacari perpetually (naisthika); agatam--returned.
Sukadeva Gosvami said: The son of Nabhaga named Nabhaga lived for a long time at the place of his
spiritual master. Therefore, his brothers thought that he was not going to become a grhastha and would
not return. Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of their father
among themselves. When Nabhaga returned from the place of his spiritual master, they gave him their
father as his share.
There are two kinds of brahmacaris. One may return home, marry and become a householder, whereas
the other, known as brhad-vrata, takes a vow to remain a brahmacari perpetually. The brhad-vrata
brahmacari does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly
takes sannyasa. Because Nabhaga did not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers
thought that he had taken brhadvrata-brahmacarya. Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when
he returned they gave him their father as his share.

Nabhaga's father said: All the descendants of Angira are now going to perform a great sacrifice, but
although they are very intelligent, on every sixth day they will be bewildered in performing sacrifice and
will make mistakes in their daily duties.
Nabhaga was very simple hearted. Therefore when he went to his father, the father, in compassion for
his son, suggested that as a means of livelihood Nabhaga could go to the descendants of Angira and take
advantage of their misgivings in performing yajna.

Vaisvadeva. When the great sages have completed the sacrifice and are going to the heavenly planets, they
will give you the remnants of the money they have received from the sacrifice. Therefore, go there
immediately." Thus Nabhaga acted exactly according to the advice of his father, and the great sages of the
Angira dynasty gave him all their wealth and then went to the heavenly planets.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Ambarisa, the most fortunate personality, achieved the rule of the
entire world, consisting of seven islands, and achieved inexhaustible, unlimited opulence and prosperity
on earth. Although such a position is rarely obtained, Maharaja Ambarisa did not care for it at all, for he
knew very well that all such opulence is material. Like that which is imagined in a dream, such opulence
will ultimately be destroyed. The King knew that any nondevotee who attains such opulence merges
increasingly into material nature's mode of darkness.
For a devotee material opulence is insignificant, whereas for a nondevotee material opulence is the
cause of increasing bondage, for a devotee knows that anything material is temporary, whereas a
nondevotee regards the temporary so-called happiness as everything and forgets the path of selfrealization.
Thus for the nondevotee material opulence is a disqualification for spiritual advancement.

Maharaja Ambarisa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Krsna, his words in
describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord's temple, and his ears in hearing the
words spoken by Krsna or about Krsna. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Krsna, Krsna's temples
and Krsna's places like Mathura and Vrndavana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of
the Lord's devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasi offered to the Lord,
and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord's prasada. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places
and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord,
twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Maharaja Ambarisa never desired anything for his own sense
gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord.
This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.
In Bhagavad-gita (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy asakta-manah partha yogam yunjan mad-asrayah.
This indicates that one must execute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under
the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not possible, however, to train oneself without
guidance from the spiritual master. Therefore, according to the instructions of Srila Rupa Gosvami, the
first business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various
senses in rendering transcendental service to the Lord. The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1),
asamsayam samagram mam yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu. In other words, if one wants to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by Krsna by
following in the footsteps of Maharaja Ambarisa. It is said, hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate:
bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Krsna, who is called Hrsikesa
or Acyuta. These words are used in these verses. Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, hrsikesa-padabhivandane. The
words Acyuta and Hrsikesa are also used in Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita is krsna-katha spoken directly
by Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is also krsna-katha because everything described in the Bhagavatam is
in relationship with Krsna.

In performing his prescribed duties as king, Maharaja Ambarisa always offered the results of his royal
activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the enjoyer of everything and is beyond
the perception of material senses. He certainly took advice from brahmanas who were faithful devotees of
the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material world, and here in
Bhagavad-gita the peace formula is given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone
should understand that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the
planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so
on. The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gita, and Ambarisa Maharaja, as the ideal executive
head, ruled the entire world as a Vaisnava, taking advice from Vaisnava brahmanas. The sastras enjoin
that even though a brahmana may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very
learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru until he is a Vaisnava.
sat-karma-nipuno vipro
mantra-tantra-visaradah

Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-nistha-viprabhihitah, Maharaja Ambarisa took advice from
brahmanas who were pure devotees of the Lord, for ordinary brahmanas who are merely learned scholars
or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice.
In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are authorized to make laws for the
welfare of the state, but according to this description of the kingdom of Maharaja Ambarisa, the country
or the world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee brahmanas. Such advisors
or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected
by the ignorant public. Rather, they should be appointed by the king. When the king, the executive head
of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee brahmanas in ruling the country,
everyone will be peaceful and prosperous. When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing
can be wrong in the state. All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good
character will automatically follow.

"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the
demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value.
This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material
energy." (Bhag. 5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a Krsna conscious king will become devotees, and
then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state. If the citizens
are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are
guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the
spiritual world. All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration
of Maharaja Ambarisa, as described here.

ije--worshiped; asvamedhaih--by performing the horse sacrifice yajnas; adhiyajnam--to satisfy the
master of all yajnas; isvaram--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; maha-vibhutya--with great opulence;
upacita-anga-daksinaih--with all prescribed paraphernalia and contributions of daksina to the brahmanas;

dhanvani--in the desert; abhisrotam--inundated by the water of the river; asau--Maharaja Ambarisa;
sarasvatim--on the bank of the Sarasvati.
In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvati, Maharaja Ambarisa performed great sacrifices
like the asvamedha-yajna and thus satisfied the master of all yajnas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of
daksina to the brahmanas, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasistha, Asita and Gautama,
representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.
When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas, one needs expert brahmanas known
as yajnika-brahmanas. In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such brahmanas. Therefore in Kaliyuga
the sacrifice recommended in sastra is sankirtana-yajna (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi
sumedhasah). Instead of spending money unnecessarily on performing yajnas impossible to perform in
this age of Kali because of the scarcity of yajnika-brahmanas, one who is intelligent performs sankirtanayajna.
Without properly performed yajnas to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be
scarcity of rain (yajnad bhavati parjanyah). Therefore the performance of yajna is essential. Without yajna
there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will
be famines. It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types of yajnas, such as the
asvamedha-yajna, to maintain the production of food grains. Annad bhavanti bhutani. Without food
grains, both men and animals will starve. Therefore yajna is necessary for the state to perform because by
yajna the people in general will be fed sumptuously. The brahmanas and yajnika priests should be
sufficiently paid for their expert service. This payment is called daksina. Ambarisa Maharaja, as the head
of the state, performed all these yajnas through great personalities like Vasistha, Gautama and Asita.
Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (sa vai manah krsnapadaravindayoh).
The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he
must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Maharaja Ambarisa. It is the duty of the king to see that food
grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere.

The citizens of the state of Maharaja Ambarisa were accustomed to chanting and hearing about the
glorious activities of the Personality of Godhead. Thus they never aspired to be elevated to the heavenly
planets, which are extremely dear even to the demigods.
A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord
and His fame, qualities, form, paraphernalia and so on is never interested in elevation to the heavenly
planets, even though such places are extremely dear even to the demigods.

"Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
never fear any condition of life. The heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to
a devotee." (Bhag. 6.17.28) A devotee is always situated in the spiritual world. Therefore he does not
desire anything. He is known as akama, or desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render
transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Maharaja Ambarisa was a
most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were
not interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly planets.

Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such achievements
do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Krsna within the core of
his heart.
A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher planetary systems but even in the
perfections of mystic yoga. Real perfection is devotional service. The happiness derived from merging in
the impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic yoga (anima,
laghima, prapti and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee. As stated by Srila Prabodhananda
Sarasvati:
kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
(Caitanya-candramrta 5)
When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord
through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he
regards material happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o'-the-wisp. As far as the perfection of
mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth. A mystic yogi is
especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the
service of the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate) there is no need for separate control of the
senses. For those who are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee's senses are
all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled. param drstva
nivartate (Bg. 2.59). A devotee's senses are not attracted by material enjoyment. And even though the
material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because
everything is engaged in the service of the Lord. The difference between the spiritual world and material
world is the mentality of service. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate. When there is
no mentality of service to the Supreme personality of Godhead, one's activities are material.
prapanci-kataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.256)
That which is not engaged in the service of the Lord is material, and nothing thus engaged should be
given up. In the construction of a high skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the
same enthusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual. Spiritual
activities should not be confused with material activities and given up. Nothing connected with Hari, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is material. A devotee who considers all this is always situated in
spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (param drstva nivartate).

The king of this planet, Maharaja Ambarisa, thus performed devotional service to the Lord and in this
endeavor practiced severe austerity. Always satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his
constitutional activities, he gradually gave up all material desires.
Severe austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many varieties. For example, in worshiping
the Deity in the temple there are certainly laborious activities. Sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nana srngara-tanmandira-
marjanadau. One must decorate the Deity, cleanse the temple, bring water from the Ganges and
Yamuna, continue the routine work, perform arati many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity,
prepare dresses and so on. In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various activities, and the hard
labor involved is certainly an austerity. Similarly, the hard labor involved in preaching, preparing
literature, preaching to atheistic men and distributing literature door to door is of course an austerity
(tapo-yuktena). Tapo divyam putraka. Such austerity is necessary. Yena sattvam suddhyet. By such
austerity in devotional service, one is purified of material existence (kaman sanair jahau). Indeed, such
austerity leads one to the constitutional position of devotional service. In this way one can give up
material desires, and as soon as one is freed from material desires, he is free from the repetition of birth
and death, old age and disease.

In preaching, many things considered material are needed. A devotee should not have any attachment for
such material involvements as house, wife, children, friends and cars. Maharaja Ambarisa, for example,
had all such things, but he was not attached to them. This is the effect of bhakti-yoga. Bhaktih
paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag. 11.2.42). One who is advanced in devotional service has no
attachment for material things for sense enjoyment, but for preaching, to spread the glories of the Lord,
he accepts such things without attachment. Anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah. Everything can
be used to the extent that it can be engaged in Krsna's service.

Being very pleased by the unalloyed devotion of Maharaja Ambarisa, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead gave the King His disc, which is fearful to enemies and which always protects the devotee from
enemies and adversities.
A devotee, being always engaged in the service of the Lord, may not be expert in self-defense, but
because a devotee fully depends on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is always
sure of protection by the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja said:
naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaranyas
tvad-virya-gayana-mahamrta-magna-cittah
(Bhag. 7.9.43)
A devotee is always merged in the ocean of the transcendental bliss of rendering service to the Lord.
Therefore he is not at all afraid of any adverse situation in the material world. The Lord also promises,
kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O Arjuna, you may declare to the world that the devotees
of the Lord are never vanquished." (Bg. 9.31) For the protection of the devotees, Krsna's disc, the
Sudarsana cakra, is always ready. This disc is extremely fearful to the nondevotees (pratyanikabhayavaham).
Therefore although Maharaja Ambarisa was fully engaged in devotional service, his
kingdom was free of all fear of adversity.

ariradhayisuh krsnam

yuktah samvatsaram viro
dadhara dvadasi-vratam
ariradhayisuh--aspiring to worship; krsnam--the Supreme Lord, Krsna; mahisya--with his queen; tulyasilaya--
who was equally as qualified as Maharaja Ambarisa; yuktah--together; samvatsaram--for one year;
virah--the King; dadhara--accepted; dvadasi-vratam--the vow for observing Ekadasi and Dvadasi.
To worship Lord Krsna, Maharaja Ambarisa, along with his queen, who was equally qualified, observed
the vow of Ekadasi and Dvadasi for one year.
To observe Ekadasi-vrata and Dvadasi-vrata means to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Those interested in advancing in Krsna consciousness must observe Ekadasi-vrata regularly. Maharaja
Ambarisa's queen was equally as qualified as the King. Therefore it was possible for Maharaja Ambarisa to
engage his life in household affairs. In this regard, the word tulya-silaya is very significant. Unless a wife is
equally as qualified as her husband, household affairs are very difficult to continue. Canakya Pandita
advises that a person in such a situation should immediately give up household life and become a
vanaprastha or sannyasi:
mata yasya grhe nasti
bharya capriya-vadini
aranyam tena gantavyam
yatharanyam tatha grham
A person who has no mother at home and whose wife is not agreeable with him should immediately go
away to the forest. Because human life is meant for spiritual advancement only, one's wife must be helpful
in this endeavor. Otherwise there is no need of household life.

Thereafter, Maharaja Ambarisa satisfied all the guests who arrived at his house, especially the
brahmanas. He gave in charity sixty crores of cows whose horns were covered with gold plate and whose
hooves were covered with silver plate. All the cows were well decorated with garments and had full milk
bags. They were mild-natured, young and beautiful and were accompanied by their calves. After giving
these cows, the King first sumptuously fed all the brahmanas, and when they were fully satisfied, he was
about to observe the end of Ekadasi, with their permission, by breaking the fast. Exactly at that time,
however, Durvasa Muni, the great and powerful mystic, appeared on the scene as an uninvited guest.

In the meantime, only a muhurta of the Dvadasi day was left on which to break the fast. Consequently,
it was imperative that the fast be broken immediately. In this dangerous situation, the King consulted
learned brahmanas.

The King said: "To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the brahmanas is certainly a great
offense. On the other hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvadasi,
there is a flaw in one's observance of the vow. Therefore, O brahmanas, if you think that it will be
auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water." In this way, after consulting with
the brahmanas, the King reached this decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may
be accepted as eating and also as not eating.
When Maharaja Ambarisa, in his dilemma, consulted the brahmanas about whether he should break the
fast or wait for Durvasa Muni, apparently they could not give a definite answer about what to do. A
Vaisnava, however, is the most intelligent personality. Therefore Maharaja Ambarisa himself decided, in
the presence of the brahmanas, that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was
broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a brahmana. In the Vedas it is said, apo 'snati tan
naivasitam naivanasitam. This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as
eating or as not eating. Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering
to satyagraha will not eat but will drink water. Considering that drinking water would not be eating,
Maharaja Ambarisa decided to act in this way.

of religion; visnoh abhaktasya--who is not a devotee of Lord Visnu; isa-maninah--considering himself the

Alas, just see the behavior of this cruel man! He is not a devotee of Lord Visnu. Being proud of his
material opulence and his position, he considers himself God. Just see how he has transgressed the laws of
religion.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has diverted the entire meaning of this verse as spoken by Durvasa
Muni. Durvasa Muni used the word nr-samsasya to indicate that the King was cruel, but Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura interprets it to mean that the King's character was glorified by all the local people. He
says that the word nr means "by all the local people" and that samsasya means "of he (Ambarisa) whose
character was glorified." Similarly, one who is very rich becomes mad because of his wealth and is
therefore called sriya-unmattasya, but Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura interprets these words to mean
that although Maharaja Ambarisa was such an opulent king, he was not mad after money, for he had
already surpassed the madness of material opulence. Similarly, the word isa-maninah is interpreted to
mean that he was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress the laws
for observing Ekadasi-parana, despite the thinking of Durvasa Muni, for he only took water. In this way,
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has supported Ambarisa Maharaja and all his activities.

A devotee cannot be defeated by a so-called mystic yogi. This will be proved by the failure of Durvasa
Muni's endeavor to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa. Harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-gunah (Bhag. 5.18.12).
One who is not a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord has no good qualifications, however great a mystic,
philosopher or fruitive worker he may be. Only a devotee emerges victorious in all circumstances, as will
be shown in this incident involving the rivalry between Durvasa and Maharaja Ambarisa.

not move even slightly from his position.
Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati (Bhag. 6.17.28). A pure devotee of Narayana is never afraid
of any material danger. There are many examples of devotees such as Prahlada Maharaja, who was
tortured by his father but was not at all afraid, although he was only a five-year-old boy. Therefore,
following the examples of Ambarisa Maharaja and Prahlada Maharaja, a devotee should learn how to
tolerate all such awkward positions in this world. Devotees are often tortured by nondevotees, yet the
pure devotee, depending fully on the mercy of the Supreme personality of Godhead, is never disturbed by
such inimical activities.

As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake, so, by the previous order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, His disc, the Sudarsana cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the created
demon to protect the Lord's devotee.
As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa, although in such danger, did not move an inch from his
position, nor did he request the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give him protection. He was fixed in
understanding, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
the core of his heart. A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead always, not for any material profit, but as his duty. The Lord, however, knows how to protect
His devotee. As indicated by the words prag distam, the Lord knew everything. Therefore, before anything
happened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect Maharaja Ambarisa. This protection is offered
to a devotee even from the very beginning of his devotional service. Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah
pranasyati (Bg. 9.31). If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately protected by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.66): aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami. Protection begins immediately. The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the devotee
proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in Krsna
consciousness without outward disturbances. A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the
furious snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest. Although an enemy of a devotee may
be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional service.

Godhead approaches as death, or the supreme controller of time, He takes everything away. In other
words, all opulence, prestige and everything we possess is given by the Supreme Lord for some purpose. It
is the duty of the surrendered soul to execute the orders of the Supreme. No one can disregard Him.
Under the circumstances, Lord Brahma refused to give shelter to Durvasa Muni from the powerful
Sudarsana cakra sent by the Lord.

There are innumerable universes in the material world, and there are innumerable Lord Brahmas, Lord

also refused to protect Durvasa, for Lord Siva also was under the rays of the Sudarsana cakra sent by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sri-bhagavan uvaca
aham bhakta-paradhino
hy asvatantra iva dvija
sadhubhir grasta-hrdayo
bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyah
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; aham--I; bhakta-paradhinah--am
dependent on the will of My devotees; hi--indeed; asvatantrah--am not independent; iva--exactly like that;
dvija--O brahmana; sadhubhih--by pure devotees, completely free from all material desires; grastahrdayah--
My heart is controlled; bhaktaih--because they are devotees; bhakta-jana-priyah--I am
dependent not only on My devotee but also on My devotee's devotee (the devotee's devotee is extremely
dear to Me).
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brahmana: I am completely under the control of My
devotees. Indeed, I am not at all independent. Because My devotees are completely devoid of material
desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts. What to speak of My devotee, even those who are
devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.
All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, are fully under
the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully
under the control of His devotee. Why is this? Because the devotee is anyabhilasita-sunya; in other words,
he has no material desires in his heart. His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and how to serve Him best. Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is
extremely favorable to the devotees--indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees.
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without being a devotee
of a devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement. Therefore Caitanya Mahaprabhu
identified Himself as gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah. Thus he instructed us to become
not directly servants of Krsna but servants of the servant of Krsna. Devotees like Brahma, Narada,
Vyasadeva and Sukadeva Gosvami are directly servants of Krsna, and one who becomes a servant of
Narada, Vyasadeva and Sukadeva, like the six Gosvamis, is still more devoted. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura therefore says, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah: if one very sincerely serves the spiritual
master, Krsna certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee. Following the instructions of a devotee is
more valuable than following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.

atyantikim--the supreme; brahman--O brahmana; yesam--of whom; gatih--destination; aham--I am; para--
the ultimate.
O best of the brahmanas, without saintly persons for whom I am the only destination, I do not desire to
enjoy My transcendental bliss and My supreme opulences.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy His transcendental bliss He requires
the cooperation of His devotees. In Vrndavana, for example, although Lord Krsna is full in Himself, He
wants the cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the gopis to increase His transcendental
bliss. Such pure devotees, who can increase the pleasure potency of the Supreme personality of Godhead,
are certainly most dear to Him. Not only does the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoy the company of
His devotees, but because He is unlimited He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly. Thus, He
descends to the material world to induce the nondevotees and rebellious living entities to return home,
back to Godhead. He requests them to surrender unto Him because, unlimited as He is, He wants to
increase His devotees unlimitedly. The Krsna consciousness movement is an attempt to increase the
number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more and more. It is certain that a devotee who helps in
this endeavor to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the
Supreme Lord. Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does not feel transcendental bliss
without His devotees. An example that may be cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have
sons in a family he does not feel happiness. Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a son to complete his
happiness. The science of transcendental bliss is known to the pure devotee. Therefore the pure devotee is
always engaged in increasing the transcendental happiness of the Lord.

ye--those devotees of Mine who; dara--wife; agara--house; putra--children, sons; apta--relatives, society;
pranan--even life; vittam--wealth; imam--all these; param--elevation to the heavenly planets or becoming
one by merging into Brahman; hitva--giving up (all these ambitions and paraphernalia); mam--unto Me;
saranam--shelter; yatah--having taken; katham--how; tan--such persons; tyaktum--to give them up;
utsahe--I can be enthusiastic in that way (it is not possible).
Since pure devotees give up their homes, wives, children, relatives, riches and even their lives simply to
serve Me, without any desire for material improvement in this life or in the next, how can I give up such
devotees at any time?
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the words brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya
ca. Thus He is the well-wisher of the brahmanas. Durvasa Muni was certainly a very great brahmana, but
because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service. Great mystic yogis
are actually self-interested. The proof is that when Durvasa Muni created a demon to kill Maharaja
Ambarisa, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and
depending solely and wholly on Him, whereas when Durvasa Muni was chased by the Sudarsana cakra by
the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the world and tried to take shelter
in every nook and corner of the universe. At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahma, Lord Siva
and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was so interested in his own body that he wanted
to kill the body of a Vaisnava. Therefore, he did not have very good intelligence, and how can an
unintelligent person be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give
all protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of serving Him.
Another point in this verse is that attachment to daragara-putrapta--home, wife, children, friendship,
society and love--is not the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who is
attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure devotee. Sometimes a pure
devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the
Supreme Lord to the best of his ability. For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to take
away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children,
friends and so on. This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to
Godhead.

As chaste women bring their gentle husbands under control by service, the pure devotees, who are equal
to everyone and completely attached to Me in the core of the heart, bring Me under their full control.
In this verse, the word sama-darsanah is significant. The pure devotee is actually equal toward everyone,
as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.54): brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati. samah sarvesu
bhutesu. Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (panditah sama-darsinah). A pure
devotee is actually learned because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the
Supreme Lord. Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically liberated (brahma-bhutah). He
can therefore see everyone on the spiritual platform. He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all
living entities. He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and that what is
distress to him is distressing for others. Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone. As Prahlada Maharaja
said:
soce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyarthamaya-
sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan
(Bhag. 7.9.43)
People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. A pure devotee's chief concern, therefore, is to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of
Krsna consciousness.

My devotees, who are always satisfied to be engaged in My loving service, are not interested even in the
four principles of liberation [salokya, sarupya, samipya and sarsti], although these are automatically
achieved by their service. What then is to be said of such perishable happiness as elevation to the higher
planetary systems?
Srila Bilvamangala Thakura has estimated the value of liberation as follows:
muktih svayam mukulitanjalih sevate 'sman
dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksah
Bilvamangala Thakura realized that if one develops his natural devotional service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, mukti stands before him with folded hands to offer all kinds of service. In other
words, the devotee is already liberated. There is no need for him to aspire for different types of liberation.
The pure devotee automatically achieves liberation, even without desiring it.

The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart, and I am always in the heart of the pure
devotee. My devotees do not know anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them.
Since Durvasa Muni wanted to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, it is to be understood that he wanted to give
pain to the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the Lord says, sadhavo hrdayam mahyam:
"The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart." The Lord's feelings are like those of a father,
who feels pain when his child is in pain. Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet of
a devotee. Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it
causes devastation. Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a
pure devotee. Actually Maharaja Ambarisa was not at all at fault; Durvasa Muni unnecessarily wanted to
chastise him on flimsy grounds. Maharaja Ambarisa wanted to complete the Ekadasi-parana as part of
devotional service to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water.
But although Durvasa Muni was a great mystic brahmana, he did not know what is what. That is the
difference between a pure devotee and a so-called learned scholar of Vedic knowledge. The devotees,
being always situated in the core of the Lord's heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as
confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajnana-jam tamah
nasayamy atma-bhavastho
jnana-dipena bhasvata
"Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge
the darkness born of ignorance." The devotee does not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. As it is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya. Even the most learned
or experienced person cannot understand the movements of a Vaisnava, a pure devotee. No one,
therefore, should criticize a pure Vaisnava. A Vaisnava knows his own business; whatever he does is
precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

O brahmana, let Me now advise you for your own protection. Please hear from Me. By offending
Maharaja Ambarisa, you have acted with self-envy. Therefore you should go to him immediately, without
a moment's delay. One's so-called prowess, when employed against the devotee, certainly harms he who
employs it. Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.
A Vaisnava is always an object of envy for nondevotees, even when the nondevotee happens to be his
father. To give a practical example, Hiranyakasipu was envious of Prahlada Maharaja, but this envy of the
devotee was harmful to Hiranyakasipu, not to Prahlada. Every action taken by Hiranyakasipu against his
son Prahlada Maharaja was taken very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when
Hiranyakasipu was on the verge of killing Prahlada, the Lord personally appeared and killed
Hiranyakasipu. Service to a Vaisnava gradually accumulates and becomes an asset for the devotee.
Similarly, harmful activities directed against the devotee gradually become the ultimate cause of the
performer's falldown. Even such a great brahmana and mystic yogi as Durvasa was in a most dangerous
situation because of his offense at the lotus feet of Maharaja Ambarisa, a pure devotee.

For a brahmana, austerity and learning are certainly auspicious, but when acquired by a person who is
not gentle, such austerity and learning are most dangerous.
It is said that a jewel is very valuable, but when it is on the hood of a serpent, it is dangerous despite its
value. Similarly, when a materialistic nondevotee achieves great success in learning and austerity, that
success is dangerous for all of society. So-called learned scientists, for example, invented atomic weapons
that are dangerous for all humanity. It is therefore said, manina bhusitah sarpah kim asau na
bhayankarah. A serpent with a jewel on its hood is as dangerous as a serpent without such a jewel.
Durvasa Muni was a very learned brahmana equipped with mystic power, but because he was not a
gentleman, he did not know how to use his power. He was therefore extremely dangerous. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a dangerous person who uses his mystic power for some
personal design. By the laws of nature, therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for
society but for the person who misuses it.

The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Maharaja Ambarisa and Durvasa Muni is that
all the demigods, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, are under the control of Lord Visnu. Therefore,
when a Vaisnava is offended, the offender is punished by Visnu, the Supreme Lord. No one can protect
such a person, even Lord Brahma or Lord Siva.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Ambarisa Maharaja Offended by Durvasa Muni."
Chapter Five
Durvasa Muni's Life Spared
In this chapter we find Maharaja Ambarisa offering prayers to the Sudarsana cakra and we find how the
Sudarsana cakra became merciful to Durvasa Muni.
By the order of the Supreme personality of Godhead, Visnu, Durvasa Muni immediately went to
Maharaja Ambarisa and fell at his lotus feet. Maharaja Ambarisa, being naturally very humble and meek,
felt shy and ashamed because Durvasa Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to
the Sudarsana cakra just to save Durvasa. What is this Sudarsana cakra? The Sudarsana cakra is the glance
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world. Sa aiksata, sa
asrjata. This is the Vedic version. The Sudarsana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is most dear to
the Lord, has thousands of spokes. This Sudarsana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons,
the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of
establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities. Without his mercy, the
universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarsana cakra is employed by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. When Maharaja Ambarisa thus prayed that the Sudarsana cakra be merciful, the
Sudarsana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durvasa Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarsana
cakra's mercy. Durvasa Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaisnava an ordinary
person (vaisnave jati-buddhi). Maharaja Ambarisa belonged to the ksatriya group, and therefore Durvasa
Muni considered him lower than the brahmanas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him.
By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaisnavas. After this
incident, Maharaja Ambarisa gave Durvasa Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been
standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took prasada. Maharaja Ambarisa
later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Manasa-sarovara to execute
devotional meditation.

original vision of the Lord, and therefore you are known as Sudarsana. Everything has been created by
your activities, and therefore you are all-pervading.
The word sudarsana means "auspicious vision." From Vedic instructions we understand that this
material world is created by the glance of the Supreme personality of Godhead (sa aiksata, sa asrjata). The
Supreme personality of Godhead glanced over the mahat-tattva, or the total material energy, and when it
was agitated, everything came into existence. Western philosophers sometimes think that the original
cause of creation was a chunk that exploded. If one thinks of this chunk as the total material energy, the
mahat-tattva, one can understand that the chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and thus the
Lord's glance is the original cause of material creation.

O Sudarsana, you have a very auspicious hub, and therefore you are the upholder of all religion. You are

worlds, you are full of transcendental effulgence, you are as quick as the mind, and you are able to work
wonders. I can simply utter the word namah, offering all obeisances unto you.
The disc of the Lord is called Sudarsana because he does not discriminate between high and low
criminals or demons. Durvasa Muni was certainly a powerful brahmana, but his acts against the pure
devotee Maharaja Ambarisa were no better than the activities of asuras. As stated in the sastras, dharmam
tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam: the word dharma refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme
personality of Godhead. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: real dharma is surrender
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to
the Lord. The Sudarsana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma. Maharaja
Ambarisa was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarsana cakra was ready
to punish even such a strict brahmana as Durvasa Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are
demons even in the form of brahmanas. Therefore the Sudarsana cakra does not discriminate between
brahmana demons and sudra demons. Anyone against the Supreme personality of Godhead and His
devotees is called a demon. In the sastras we find many brahmanas and ksatriyas who acted as demons
and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the sastras, one has to be understood
according to his symptoms. If one is born of a brahmana father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is
regarded as a demon. The Sudarsana cakra is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore
he is described as adharma-silasura-dhuma-ketave. Those who are not devotees are called adharma-sila.
The Sudarsana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons.

O master of speech, by your effulgence, full of religious principles, the darkness of the world is

your effulgence, for all things, manifested and unmanifested, gross and subtle, superior and inferior, are
but various forms of you that are manifested by your effulgence.
Without illumination, nothing can be seen, especially in this material world. The illumination in this
world emanates from the effulgence of Sudarsana, the original vision of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The illuminating principles of the sun, the moon and fire emanate from Sudarsana. Similarly,
illumination by knowledge also comes from Sudarsana because with the illumination of Sudarsana one
can distinguish one thing from another, the superior from the inferior. Generally people accept a powerful
yogi like Durvasa Muni as wonderfully superior, but if such a person is chased by the Sudarsana cakra, we
can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is because of his dealings with devotees.

Durvasa Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King. At first I thought of you as an ordinary
human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that
you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord. Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and
talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.
It is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even a very intelligent man cannot understand the
activities of a pure Vaisnava. Therefore, because Durvasa Muni was a great mystic yogi, he first mistook
Maharaja Ambarisa for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him. Such is the mistaken
observation of a Vaisnava. When Durvasa Muni was persecuted by the Sudarsana cakra, however, his
intelligence developed. Therefore the word atma-medhasa is used to indicate that by his personal
experience he would understand how great a Vaisnava the King was. When Durvasa Muni was chased by
the Sudarsana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, and he was even able to go
to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable
to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarsana cakra. Thus he could understand the influence of a
Vaisnava by personal experience. Durvasa Muni was certainly a great yogi and a very learned brahmana,
but despite his being a real yogi he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaisnava. Therefore it is
said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the
value of a Vaisnava. There is always a possibility for so-called jnanis and yogis to be mistaken when
studying the character of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava can be understood by how much he is favored by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.

Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thus being satisfied in all respects, the great mystic yogi Durvasa took
permission and left, continuously glorifying the King. Through the skyways, he went to Brahmaloka,
which is devoid of agnostics and dry philosophical speculators.
Although Durvasa Muni went back to Brahmaloka through the spaceways, he did not need an airplane,
for great mystic yogis can transport themselves from any planet to any other without any machine. There
is a planet named Siddhaloka whose inhabitants can go to any other planet because they naturally have all
the perfection of yoga practice. Thus Durvasa Muni, the great mystic yogi, could go through the skyways
to any planet, even to Brahmaloka. In Brahmaloka, everyone is self-realized, and thus there is no need of
philosophical speculation to come to the conclusion of the Absolute Truth. Durvasa Muni's purpose in
going to Brahmaloka was apparently to speak to the residents of Brahmaloka about how powerful a
devotee is and how a devotee can surpass every living entity within this material world. The so-called
jnanis and yogis cannot compare to a devotee.

Lord.
After one year, when Durvasa Muni had returned, King Ambarisa sumptuously fed him all varieties of
pure food, and then he himself also ate. When the King saw that the brahmana Durvasa had been released
from the great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was
also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been done by the Lord.
A devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is certainly always busy in many activities. Of course, this material
world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed. The vivid example is Maharaja Ambarisa. He was the
emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were
many disturbances created by persons like Durvasa Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently
depending fully on the mercy of the Lord. The Lord, however, is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya
caham hrdi sannivistah), and He manages things as He desires. Thus although Maharaja Ambarisa was
faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end
Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa became great friends and parted cordially on the basis of bhaktiyoga.
After all, Durvasa Muni was convinced of the power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great
mystic yogi. Therefore, as stated by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." Thus it is a fact that a devotee
is the topmost yogi, as proved in the dealings of Maharaja Ambarisa with Durvasa Muni.

evam--in this way; vidha-aneka-gunah--endowed with varieties of good qualities; sah--he, Maharaja
Ambarisa; raja--the King; para-atmani--unto the Supersoul; brahmani--unto Brahman; vasudeve--unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, Vasudeva; kriya-kalapaih--by practical activities; samuvaha--
executed; bhaktim--devotional service; yaya--by such activities; avirincyan--beginning from the topmost
planet; nirayan--down to the hellish planets; cakara--he experienced that there is danger everywhere.
In this way, because of devotional service, Maharaja Ambarisa, who was endowed with varieties of
transcendental qualities, was completely aware of Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and thus he executed devotional service perfectly. Because of his devotion, he thought even the
topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.
An exalted and pure devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is in full awareness of Brahman, Paramatma and
Bhagavan; in other words, a devotee of Vasudeva, Krsna, is in full knowledge of the other features of the
Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is realized in three features--Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan
(brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate). A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, knows everything (vasudevah sarvam iti) because Vasudeva, Krsna, includes both Paramatma
and Brahman. One does not have to realize Paramatma by the yoga system, for the devotee always
thinking of Vasudeva is the topmost yogi (yoginam api sarvesam). And as far as jnana is concerned, if one
is a perfect devotee of Vasudeva, he is the greatest mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma
sudurlabhah). A mahatma is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Thus Maharaja Ambarisa,
being a devotee of the personality of Godhead, was in full awareness of Paramatma, Brahman, maya, the
material world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere. Everything was known to
him. Yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati. Because the devotee knows Vasudeva, he knows
everything within the creation of Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). Such a
devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of happiness within this material world.
narayana-parah sarve
na kutascana bibhyati
svargapavarga-narakesv
api tulyartha-darsinah
(Bhag. 6.17.28)
Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any position in the material world as
important. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has therefore written (Caitanya-candramrta 5):
kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate
durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate
visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate
yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah
For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great personalities like Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, kaivalya, or merging into Brahman, appears no better than hell. As far as the heavenly
planets are concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o'-the-wisp, and as far as yogic
perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic
perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee. This is all possible when one becomes a devotee of
the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mahaprabhu's instructions.

divided his property among his sons, who were equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of
vanaprastha and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord Vasudeva.
As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa was liberated in any condition of life because, as enunciated by
Srila Rupa Gosvami, a devotee is always liberated.
iha yasya harer dasye

In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Rupa Gosvami thus instructs that if one's only desire is service to the
Lord, he is liberated in any condition of life. Maharaja Ambarisa was undoubtedly liberated in any
condition, but as an ideal king he accepted the vanaprastha order of retirement from family life. It is
essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Vasudeva.
Therefore Maharaja Ambarisa divided the kingdom among his sons and retired from family life.

Anyone who chants this narration or even thinks of this narration about the activities of Maharaja
Ambarisa certainly becomes a pure devotee of the Lord.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura herein gives a very good example. When one is very eager for more
and more money, he is not satisfied even when he is a millionaire or a multimillionaire, but wants to earn
more and more money by any means. The same mentality is present in a devotee. The devotee is never
satisfied, thinking, "This is the limit of my devotional service." The more he engages in the service of the
Lord, the more service he wants to give. This is the position of a devotee. Maharaja Ambarisa, in his
family life, was certainly a pure devotee, complete in every respect, because his mind and all his senses
were engaged in devotional service (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacamsi vaikunthagunanuvarnane).
Maharaja Ambarisa was self-satisfied because all of his senses were engaged in
devotional service (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam. hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir
ucyate). Nonetheless, although Maharaja Ambarisa had engaged all his senses in devotional service, he left
his home and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully at the lotus feet of Krsna, exactly as a
mercantile man, even though complete in wealth, tries to earn more and more. This mentality of getting
more and more engaged in devotional service puts one in the most exalted position. Whereas on the
karma platform the mercantile man who wants more and more money becomes increasingly bound and
entangled, the devotee becomes increasingly liberated.

entitled "Durvasa Muni's Life Spared."
Chapter Six
The Downfall of Saubhari Muni
After describing the descendants of Maharaja Ambarisa, Sukadeva Gosvami described all the kings from
Sasada to Mandhata, and in this connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the
daughters of Mandhata.
Maharaja Ambarisa had three sons, named Virupa, Ketuman and Sambhu. The son of Virupa was
Prsadasva, and his son was Rathitara. Rathitara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great
sage Angira, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathitara's wife. When the sons were born, they
became the dynasty of Angira Rsi and of Rathitara.
The son of Manu was Iksvaku, who had one hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were
the eldest. The sons of Maharaja Iksvaku became kings of different parts of the world. Because of violating
sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikuksi, was banished from the kingdom. By the mercy
of Vasistha and the power of mystic yoga, Maharaja Iksvaku attained liberation after giving up his material
body. When Maharaja Iksvaku expired, his son Vikuksi returned and took charge of the kingdom. He
performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
Vikuksi later became celebrated as Sasada.
Vikuksi's son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and because of his valuable service
he became famous as Puranjaya, Indravaha and Kakutstha. The son of Puranjaya was Anena, the son of
Anena was Prthu, and the son of Prthu was Visvagandhi. The son of Visvagandhi was Candra, the son of
Candra was Yuvanasva, and his son was Sravasta, who constructed Sravasti Puri. The son of Sravasta was
Brhadasva. Brhadasva's son Kuvalayasva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated
as Dhundhumara, "the killer of Dhundhu." The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Drdhasva, Kapilasva
and Bhadrasva. He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from
Dhundhu. The son of Drdhasva was Haryasva, the son of Haryasva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha
was Bahulasva, and the son of Bahulasva was Krsasva. The son of Krsasva was Senajit, and his son was
Yuvanasva.
Yuvanasva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest. In the
forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajna on his behalf. Once, however, the King
became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajna. Consequently, after
some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen. The son, who was very beautiful, was
crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck. Thus the son became
known as Mandhata. In due course of time, Yuvanasva achieved perfection by performing austerities.
Thereafter, Mandhata became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands. Thieves
and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as
Trasaddasyu, meaning "one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves." Mandhata begot sons in the womb
of his wife, Bindumati. These sons were Purukutsa, Ambarisa and Mucukunda. These three sons had fifty
sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.
In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual
agitation caused by fish, fell from his yoga and wanted to marry all the daughters of Mandhata for sexual
pleasure. Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful. Thus he accepted the order of vanaprastha,
performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection. In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami
described how Saubhari Muni's wives also became perfect.

Rathitara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Angira to beget sons for him. Because
of this request, Angira begot sons in the womb of Rathitara's wife. All these sons were born with
brahminical prowess.
In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the womb of a lesser man's wife for
the sake of better progeny. In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field. A person
possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because
the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land.
Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but
the sons born of her would then become her husband's sons. Such sons were called ksetra jata. Because
Rathitara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.

Having been born from the womb of Rathitara's wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of
Rathitara, but because they were born from the semen of Angira, they were also known as the dynasty of
Angira. Among all the progeny of Rathitara, these sons were the most prominent because, owing to their
birth, they were considered brahmanas.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the meaning of dvi jatayah as "mixed caste," indicating a
mixture of brahmana and ksatriya.

Thereafter, Iksvaku's son Vikuksi went to the forest and killed many animals suitable for being offered
as oblations. But when fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.
It is evident that ksatriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be
offered at a particular type of yajna. Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as
sraddha is also a kind of yajna. In this yajna, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered.
However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden. Quoting from the Brahmavaivarta
Purana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau panca vivarjayet
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in
sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a
man's begetting children in his brother's wife." The word pala-paitrkam refers to an offering of flesh in
oblations to forefathers. Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden. In this age,
Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are sudras, not ksatriyas.
According to Vedic injunctions, however, only ksatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas sudras are allowed
to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kali or similar
demigods. On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to
eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions. As far as eating beef is concerned, however,
it is strictly prohibited to everyone. Thus in Bhagavad-gita Krsna personally speaks of go-raksyam, cow
protection. Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the sastra, are allowed
to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows. Cows must be given all protection.

Vikuksi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Iksvaku, who gave it to Vasistha for purification. But
Vasistha could immediately understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by Vikuksi, and
therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the sraddha ceremony.
That which is meant to be offered in yajna cannot be tasted by anyone before being offered to the Deity.
In our temples, this regulation is in effect. One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the
Deity. If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is polluted and can
no longer be offered. Those engaged in Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved
from committing offenses in Deity worship.

This is the beginning of the story of Saubhari Rsi. According to Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura,
Mandhata was the king of Mathura, and Saubhari Rsi was engaged in austerity while submerged deep

Mandhata to ask that one of the King's daughters become his wife.

Saubhari, the greatly powerful mystic.
Saubhari Muni thought: I am now feeble because of old age. My hair has become grey, my skin is slack,
and my head always trembles. Besides, I am a yogi. Therefore women do not like me. Since the King has
thus rejected me, I shall reform my body in such a way as to be desirable even to celestial women, what to
speak of the daughters of worldly kings.

Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe austerities resulted in an
opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants,
and varieties of parks with clear-water lakes and gardens. In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of flowers,
birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers. Saubhari Muni's home was amply
provided with valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of
sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes. Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia, the
muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.
Saubhari Rsi was a great yogi. Yogic perfection makes available eight material opulences--anima,
laghima, mahima, prapti, prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita. Saubhari Muni exhibited superexcellence
in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection. The word bahv-rca means "expert in
chanting mantras." As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be
achieved by subtle means through mantras. By chanting mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged for material
opulence, but this was not perfection in life. As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with
material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the vanaprastha order and achieved
final success. Those who are not atma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be
satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are atma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material
opulence. This is the instruction we can derive from the life and activities of Saubhari Muni.

In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the material world, but he was not at all
satisfied, just as a fire never ceases blazing if constantly supplied with drops of fat.
Material desire is just like a blazing fire. If a fire is continually supplied with drops of fat, the fire will
increase more and more and never be extinguished. Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material
desires by catering to one's material demands will never be successful. In modern civilization, everyone is
engaged in economic development, which is another way of constantly dropping fat into the material fire.
The Western countries have reached the summit of material civilization, but people are still dissatisfied.
Real satisfaction is Krsna consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), where Krsna says:
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all
planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs
of material miseries." One must therefore take to Krsna consciousness and advance in Krsna
consciousness by properly following the regulative principles. Then one can attain an eternal, blissful life
in peace and knowledge.

Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded
place, he thought to himself about the cause of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated
himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a
vaisnava-aparadha. The history is that when Garuda wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave
the fish shelter under his care. Because Garuda's plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni
certainly committed a great offense to a Vaisnava. Because of this vaisnava-aparadha, an offense at the
lotus feet of a Vaisnava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya. One should not,
therefore, impede the activities of a Vaisnava. This is the lesson we must learn from this incident
concerning Saubhari Muni.

yunjita--one can engage himself; tat-vratisu--with persons of the same category (desiring liberation from

A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give up the association of persons interested in
sex life and should not employ his senses externally [in seeing, hearing, talking, walking and so on]. One
should always stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited
Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should associate with persons similarly
engaged.
Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience, instructs us that persons
interested in crossing to the other side of the material ocean must give up the association of persons
interested in sex life and accumulating money. This is also advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:
niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukasya
param param jigamisor bhava-sagarasya
sandarsanam visayinam atha yositam ca
ha hanta hanta visa-bhaksanato 'py asadhu
(Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka 8.27)
"Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving
service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing
a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly."
One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage himself in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. He must not associate with visayi--materialistic persons or those interested in
sex life. Every materialist is interested in sex. Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly
person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura also
recommends that one engage in the service of the acaryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must
live in the association of devotees (tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa). The Krsna consciousness
movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of
such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs. Although this is an
ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. By
gradually associating with the members of the Krsna consciousness movement, simply by taking prasada
and taking part in chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated.
Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water. Because of the
bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down. A secluded place is also not secure unless there
is good association.

When Saubhari Muni, who was quite conversant with the self, went to the forest, he performed severe
penances. In this way, in the fire at the time of death, he ultimately engaged himself in the service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more desire for material enjoyment the
subtle body is also ended, and in this way a pure soul remains. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(tyaktva deham punar janma naiti). If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material
bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the
Lord. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears

O Maharaja Pariksit, by observing their husband progressing in spiritual existence, Saubhari Muni's
wives were also able to enter the spiritual world by his spiritual power, just as the flames of a fire cease
when the fire is extinguished.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te 'pi yanti param gatim. Women are not
considered very powerful in following spiritual principles, but if a woman is fortunate enough to get a
suitable husband who is spiritually advanced and if she always engages in his service, she also gets the
same benefit as her husband. Here it is clearly said that the wives of Saubhari Muni also entered the
spiritual world by the influence of their husband. They were unfit, but because they were faithful
followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him. Thus a woman should be a
faithful servant of her husband, and if the husband is spiritually advanced, the woman will automatically
get the opportunity to enter the spiritual world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Downfall of Saubhari Muni."
Chapter Seven
The Descendants of King Mandhata
In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in this connection the histories of
Purukutsa and Hariscandra are also given.
The most prominent son of Mandhata was Ambarisa, his son was Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva's son was
Harita. These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata. Purukutsa, another son of
Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named Narmada. The son of Purukutsa was
Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaranya. Anaranya's son was Haryasva, Haryasva's son was Praruna,
Praruna's son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana's son was Satyavrata, also known as Trisanku. When
Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trisanku
became a candala, worse than a sudra. Later, by the influence of Visvamitra, he was brought to the
heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward. He was stopped in his fall,
however, by the influence of Visvamitra. The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra. Hariscandra once
performed a Rajasuya-yajna, but Visvamitra cunningly took all of Hariscandra's possessions as a daksina
contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways. Because of this, a quarrel arose between
Visvamitra and Vasistha. Hariscandra had no sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and
in this way got a son named Rohita. Hariscandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a
Varuna-yajna. Varuna reminded Hariscandra repeatedly about this yajna, but the King, because of
affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him. Thus time passed, and gradually the
son grew up. To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest.
Meanwhile, at home, Hariscandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna. When Rohita
received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra
prevented him from doing so. Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years
and then returned home. Rohita purchased Sunahsepha, the second son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his
father, Hariscandra, as the sacrificial animal. In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the
other demigods were pacified, and Hariscandra was freed from disease. In this sacrifice, Visvamitra was
the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata. King
Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariscandra a golden chariot, and Visvamitra gave him
transcendental knowledge. Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes how Hariscandra achieved perfection.

The son of Tribandhana was Satyavrata, who is celebrated by the name Trisanku. Because he kidnapped
the daughter of a brahmana when she was being married, his father cursed him to become a candala,
lower than a sudra. Thereafter, by the influence of Visvamitra, he went to the higher planetary system, the
heavenly planets, in his material body, but because of the prowess of the demigods he fell back
downward. Nonetheless, by the power of Visvamitra, he did not fall all the way down; even today he can
still be seen hanging in the sky, head downward.

traisankavo hariscandro
visvamitra-vasisthayoh
yan-nimittam abhud yuddham
paksinor bahu-varsikam
traisankavah--the son of Trisanku; hariscandrah--by the name Hariscandra; visvamitra-vasisthayoh--
between Visvamitra and Vasistha; yat-nimittam--because of Hariscandra; abhut--there was; yuddham--a
great fight; paksinoh--both of whom had been converted into birds; bahu-varsikam--for many years.
The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra. Because of Hariscandra there was a quarrel between Visvamitra
and Vasistha, who for many years fought one another, having been transformed into birds.
Visvamitra and Vasistha were always inimical. Formerly, Visvamitra was a ksatriya, and by undergoing
severe austerities he wanted to become a brahmana, but Vasistha would not agree to accept him. In this
way there was always disagreement between the two. Later, however, Vasistha accepted him because of
Visvamitra's quality of forgiveness. Once Hariscandra performed a yajna for which Visvamitra was the
priest, but Visvamitra, being angry at Hariscandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a
contribution of daksina. Vasistha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasistha
and Visvamitra. The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed the other. One of them said, "May
you become a bird," and the other said, "May you become a duck." Thus both of them became birds and
continued fighting for many years because of Hariscandra. We can see that such a great mystic yogi as
Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and such great sages as Vasistha and Visvamitra became
birds. This is the material world. Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna. Within this material
world, or within this universe, however elevated one may be in material qualities, one must suffer the
conditions of birth, death, old age and disease (janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi). Therefore Krsna says that this
material world is simply miserable (duhkhalayam asasvatam). The Bhagavatam says, padam padam yad
vipadam: at every step here there is danger. Therefore, because the Krsna consciousness movement
provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world simply by chanting the
Hare Krsna mantra, this movement is the greatest benediction in human society.

It appears that in those days a man could be purchased for any purpose. Hariscandra was in need of a
person to sacrifice as the animal in a yajna and thus fulfill his promise to Varuna, and a man was
purchased from another man for this purpose. Millions of years ago, animal sacrifice and slave trade both
existed. Indeed, they have existed since time immemorial.

Maharaja Hariscandra first purified his mind, which was full of material enjoyment, by amalgamating it
with the earth. Then he amalgamated the earth with water, the water with fire, the fire with the air, and
the air with the sky. Thereafter, he amalgamated the sky with the total material energy, and the total
material energy with spiritual knowledge. This spiritual knowledge is realization of one's self as part of the
Supreme Lord. When the self-realized spiritual soul is engaged in service to the Lord, he is eternally
imperceptible and inconceivable. Thus established in spiritual knowledge, he is completely freed from
material bondage.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Descendants of King Mandhata."
Chapter Eight
The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva
In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described. In the dynasty of Rohita there was a
king named Sagara, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of
Sagara.
The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township
known as Campapuri. The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was
Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka. Bahuka, the son of Vrka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies,
and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest. When he died there, his wife wanted to
accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva
found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so. The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her
poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison. The son was therefore named Sagara (sa
means "with," and gara means "poison"). Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara
reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras. The king did not kill them,
but reformed them. Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha
sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven. King Sagara
had two wives, named Sumati and Kesini. While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively
dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sagara
Ocean. In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to
have stolen the horse. With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes.
Kesini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamanjasa, whose son Amsuman later searched
for the horse and delivered his uncles. Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Amsuman saw both the horse
meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes. Amsuman offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by
his prayers and who returned the horse. After getting back the horse, however, Amsuman still stood
before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Amsuman was praying for the deliverance of his
forefathers. Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the
Ganges. Amsuman then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that
place with the horse for sacrifice. When King Sagara finished his yajna, he handed over the kingdom to
Amsuman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation.

Knowing that she was pregnant, the co-wives of the wife of Bahuka conspired to give her poison with
her food, but it did not act. Instead, the son was born along with the poison. Therefore he became famous
as Sagara ["one who is born with poison"]. Sagara later became the emperor. The place known as
Gangasagara was excavated by his sons.

Sagara Maharaja, following the order of his spiritual master, Aurva, did not kill the uncivilized men like
the Talajanghas, Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras. Instead, some of them he made dress awkwardly,
some of them he shaved clean but allowed to wear mustaches, some of them he left wearing loose hair,
some he half shaved, some he left without underwear, and some without external garments. Thus these
different clans were made to dress differently, but King Sagara did not kill them.

By the influence of Indra, the King of heaven, the sons of Sagara had lost their intelligence and
disrespected a great personality. Consequently, fire emanated from their own bodies, and they were
immediately burned to ashes.
The material body is a combination of earth, water, fire, air and ether. There is already fire within the
body, and our practical experience is that the heat of this fire sometimes increases and sometimes
decreases. The fire within the bodies of the sons of Sagara Maharaja became so much hotter that all of
them burned to ashes. The fire's increased heat was due to their misbehavior toward a great personality.
Such misbehavior is called mahad-vyatikrama. They were killed by the fire of their own bodies because of
insulting a great personality.

It is sometimes argued that the sons of King Sagara were burned to ashes by the fire emanating from the
eyes of Kapila Muni. This statement, however, is not approved by great learned persons, for Kapila Muni's
body is completely in the mode of goodness and therefore cannot manifest the mode of ignorance in the

Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sankhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with
which to cross over the ocean of nescience. Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material
world may take shelter of this philosophy. In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated
platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?
One who is promoted to the transcendental position (brahma-bhuta) is always jubilant (prasannatma).
He is unaffected by the false distinctions between good and bad in the material world. Therefore, such an
exalted person is samah sarvesu bhutesu; that is to say, he is equal toward everyone, not distinguishing
between friend and enemy. Because he is on the absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is
called paratma-bhuta or brahma-bhuta. Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at the sons of Sagara
Maharaja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of their own bodies.

Formerly, in his previous birth, Asamanjasa had been a great mystic yogi, but by bad association he had
fallen from his exalted position. Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a jati-smara; that
is, he had the special advantage of being able to remember his past birth. Nonetheless, he wanted to
display himself as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were abominable in the eyes of the
public and unfavorable to his relatives. He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayu by
throwing them into the depths of the water.

Because Asamanjasa engaged in such abominable activities, his father gave up affection for him and had
him exiled. Then Asamanjasa exhibited his mystic power by reviving the boys and showing them to the
King and their parents. After this, Asamanjasa left Ayodhya.
Asamanjasa was a jati-smara; because of his mystic power, he did not forget his previous consciousness.
Thus he could give life to the dead. By exhibiting wonderful activities in relation to the dead children, he
certainly attracted the attention of the King and the people in general. Then he left that place
immediately.

like us, who have been created by Brahma in various forms as demigods, animals, human beings, birds
and beasts? We are completely in ignorance. Therefore, how can we know You, who are the
Transcendence?

"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome
by the dualities of desire and hate." (Bg. 7.27) All living beings in the material world are influenced by the
three modes of material nature. Even Lord Brahma is in the mode of goodness. Similarly, the demigods are
generally in the mode of passion, and living entities lower than the demigods, such as human beings and
animals, are in the mode of ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and ignorance. Therefore Amsuman
wanted to explain that because his uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under the modes of material
nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva. "Because You are beyond even the direct and indirect
intelligence of Lord Brahma," he prayed, "unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be
possible for us to understand You."

My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone's heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body,
cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material
nature. Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna, they can see only the
actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature. Because of the actions and reactions of the
mode of ignorance, whether the living entities are awake or sleeping, they can see only the workings of
material nature; they cannot see Your Lordship.
Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, one is unable to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is situated in everyone's heart. However, because the
conditioned souls are influenced by material nature, they can see only the actions and reactions of
material nature, but not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One therefore must purify himself
internally and externally:
apavitrah pavitro va

To keep ourselves externally clean we should bathe three times daily, and for internal cleanliness we
must cleanse the heart by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. The members of the Krsna consciousness
movement must always follow this principle (bahyabhyantarah sucih). Then it will one day be possible to
see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.

O my Lord, sages freed from the influence of the three modes of material nature--sages such as the four
Kumaras [Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana and Sanatana]--are able to think of You, who are concentrated

The word svabhava refers to one's own spiritual nature or original constitutional position. When
situated in this original position, the living entity is unaffected by the modes of material nature. Sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg. 14.26). As soon as one is freed from the influence of the three
modes of material nature, he is situated on the Brahman platform. Vivid examples of personalities thus
situated are the four Kumaras and Narada. Such authorities can by nature understand the position of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but a conditioned soul not freed from the influence of material nature is
unable to realize the Supreme. In Bhagavad-gita (2.45), therefore, Krsna advises Arjuna, traigunya-visaya
veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna: one must rise above the influence of the three modes of material nature.
One who stays within the influence of the three material modes is unable to understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.

bhavantam evanucaran nirantarah
prasanta-nihsesa-manorathantarah

praharsayisyami sanatha-jivitam
"By serving You constantly, one is freed from all material desires and is completely pacified. When shall
I engage as Your permanent eternal servant and always feel joyful to have such a fitting master?"
Manorathenasati dhavato bahih: one who acts on the mental platform must descend to material
activities. Material contamination, however, is completely absent from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and His pure devotee. Therefore the Lord is addressed as prasanta, completely peaceful, free
from the disturbances of material existence. The Supreme Lord has no material name or form; only the
foolish think that the Lord's name and form are material (avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum
asritam). The identity of the Supreme Lord is that He is the original person. Nonetheless, those who have
but a poor fund of knowledge think that the Lord is formless. The Lord is formless in the material sense,
but He has His transcendental form (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha).

incarnation of Visnu, being very merciful to him, explained to him the path of knowledge.

After delivering charge of his kingdom to Amsuman and thus being freed from all material anxiety and

destination.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Sons of Sagara Meet Lord Kapiladeva."
Chapter Nine
The Dynasty of Amsuman
This chapter describes the history of the dynasty of Amsuman, up to Khatvanga, and it also describes
how Bhagiratha brought the water of the Ganges to this earth.
The son of Maharaja Amsuman was Dilipa, who tried to bring the Ganges to this world but who died
without success. Bhagiratha, the son of Dilipa, was determined to bring the Ganges to the material world,
and for this purpose he underwent severe austerities. Mother Ganges, being fully satisfied by his
austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give him a benediction. Bhagiratha then asked her to
deliver his forefathers. Although mother Ganges agreed to come down to earth, she made two conditions:
first, she wanted some suitable male to be able to control her waves; second, although all sinful men
would be freed from sinful reactions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges did not want to keep all
these sinful reactions. These two conditions were subject matters for consideration. Bhagiratha replied to
mother Ganges, "The Personality of Godhead Lord Siva will be completely able to control the waves of
your water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions left by sinful men will be
counteracted." Bhagiratha then performed austerities to satisfy Lord Siva, who is called Asutosa because
he is naturally satisfied very easily. Lord Siva agreed to Bhagiratha's proposal to check the force of the
Ganges. In this way, simply by the touch of the Ganges, Bhagiratha's forefathers were delivered and
allowed to go to the heavenly planets.
The son of Bhagiratha was Sruta, the son of Sruta was Nabha, and Nabha's son was Sindhudvipa. The
son of Sindhudvipa was Ayutayu, and the son of Ayutayu was Rtuparna, who was a friend of Nala.
Rtuparna gave Nala the art of gambling and learned from him the art of asva-vidya. The son of Rtuparna
was known as Sarvakama, the son of Sarvakama was Sudasa, and his son was Saudasa. The wife of Saudasa
was named Damayanti or Madayanti, and Saudasa was also known as Kalmasapada. Because of some
defect in his fruitive activities, Saudasa was cursed by Vasistha to become a Raksasa. While walking
through the forest, he saw a brahmana engaged in sex with his wife, and because he had become a
Raksasa he wanted to devour the brahmana. Although the brahmana's wife pleaded with him in many
ways, Saudasa devoured the brahmana, and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, "As soon as you engage
in sex you will die." After twelve years, therefore, even though Saudasa was released from the curse of
Vasistha Muni, he remained sonless. At that time, with Saudasa's permission, Vasistha impregnated
Saudasa's wife, Madayanti. Because Madayanti bore the child for many years but still could not give birth,
Vasistha struck her abdomen with a stone, and thus a son was born. The son was named Asmaka.
The son of Asmaka was known as Balika. He was protected from the curse of Parasurama because of
being surrounded by many women, and therefore he is also known as Narikavaca. When the entire world
was devoid of ksatriyas, he became the original father of more ksatriyas. He is therefore sometimes called
Mulaka. From Balika, Dasaratha was born, from Dasaratha came Aidavidi, and from Aidavidi came
Visvasaha. The son of Visvasaha was Maharaja Khatvanga. Maharaja Khatvanga joined the demigods in
fighting the demons and was victorious, and the demigods therefore wanted to give him a benediction.
But when the King inquired how long he would live and understood that his life would last only a few
seconds more, he immediately left the heavenly planets and returned to his own abode by airplane. He
could understand that everything in this material world is insignificant, and thus he fully engaged in
worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.

The King's desire was to deliver his forefathers, who had been burnt to ashes because of disrespecting

O King, I do not wish to go down to the planet earth, for there the people in general will bathe in my
water to cleanse themselves of the reactions of their sinful deeds. When all these sinful reactions
accumulate in me, how shall I become free from them? You must consider this very carefully.
The Supreme personality of Godhead says:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." (Bg. 18.66) The Supreme Personality of Godhead can accept the reactions of anyone's sinful
deeds and neutralize them because He is pavitra, pure, like the sun, which is never contaminated by any
worldly infection. Tejiyasam na dosaya vahneh sama-bhujo yatha (Bhag. 10.33.29). One who is very
powerful is not affected by any sinful activity. But here we see that mother Ganges fears being burdened
with the sins of the people in general who would bathe in her waters. This indicates that no one but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of sinful deeds, whether one's own or
those of others. Sometimes the spiritual master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that
disciple's past sinful activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer--if not fully, then partially--
for the sinful acts of the disciple. Every disciple, therefore, must be very careful not to commit sinful
activities after initiation. The poor spiritual master is kind and merciful enough to accept a disciple and
partially suffer for that disciple's sinful activities, but Krsna, being merciful to His servant, neutralizes the
reactions of sinful deeds for the servant who engages in preaching His glories. Even mother Ganges feared
the sinful reactions of the people in general and was anxious about how she would counteract the burden
of these sins.

Vedic scripture; loka-pavanah--who are engaged in delivering the entire world from a fallen condition;

bathing in the Ganges water; tesu--within themselves; aste--there is; hi--indeed; agha-bhit--the Supreme
personality, who can vanquish all sinful activities; harih--the Lord.
Bhagiratha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional service and are therefore in the renounced
order, free from material desires, and who are pure devotees, expert in following the regulative principles
mentioned in the Vedas, are always glorious and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls.
When such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions accumulated from other people will
certainly be counteracted, for such devotees always keep in the core of their hearts the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who can vanquish all sinful reactions.
Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing. Therefore, not only will sinful persons bathe in the
Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees
will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges. Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the renounced order
can deliver even the Ganges. Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gadabhrta (Bhag. 1.13.10). Because
saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy
places of all sinful reactions. Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly persons.
It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaisnava, or even a sannyasi, one should immediately offer respects
to such a holy man. If one forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day. This is
a Vedic injunction. One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing offenses at the lotus feet of
a devotee or saintly person.
There are methods of prayascitta, or atonement, but they are inadequate to cleanse one of sinful
reactions. One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the
history of Ajamila:
kecit kevalaya bhaktya
vasudeva-parayanah
agham dhunvanti kartsnyena
niharam iva bhaskarah
"Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the
weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging
devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays." (Bhag. 6.1.15) If one is under
the protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process of bhakti-yoga one is
certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions.

Like a cloth woven of threads extending for its length and breadth, this entire universe, in all its latitude
and longitude, is situated under different potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Siva is
the incarnation of the Lord, and thus he represents the Supersoul in the embodied soul. He can sustain
your forceful waves on his head.
The water of the Ganges is supposed to rest on the head of Lord Siva. Lord Siva is an incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sustains the entire universe by different potencies. Lord Siva is
described in the Brahma-samhita (5.45):
ksiram yatha dadhi vikara-visesa-yogat
sanjayate na hi tatah prthag asti hetoh
yah sambhutam api tatha samupaiti karyad
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"Milk changes into yogurt when mixed with a yogurt culture, but actually yogurt is constitutionally
nothing but milk. Similarly, Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Siva
for the special purpose of material transactions. I offer my obeisances at Lord Govinda's lotus feet." Lord
Siva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same sense that yogurt is also milk although at the
same time it is not milk. For the maintenance of the material world there are three incarnations--Brahma,
Visnu and Mahesvara (Lord Siva). Lord Siva is Visnu in an incarnation for the mode of ignorance. The
material world exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance. Therefore Lord Siva is compared here to
the longitude and latitude of the entire universe, which resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for
both its length and breadth.

After saying this, Bhagiratha satisfied Lord Siva by performing austerities. O King Pariksit, Lord Siva was
very quickly satisfied with Bhagiratha.
The words asv atusyata indicate that Lord Siva was satisfied very soon. Therefore another name for Lord
Siva is Asutosa. Materialistic persons become attached to Lord Siva because Lord Siva bestows
benedictions upon anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his devotees prosper or
suffer. Although materialistic persons know that material happiness is nothing but another side of
suffering, they want it, and to get it very quickly they worship Lord Siva. We find that materialists are
generally devotees of many demigods, especially Lord Siva and mother Durga. They do not actually want
spiritual happiness, for it is almost unknown to them. But if one is serious about being happy spiritually,
he must take shelter of Lord Visnu, as the Lord personally demands:
sarva-dharman parityajya

them became eligible to go to the heavenly planets. What then is to be said of those who use the water of
mother Ganges to worship her?
Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee takes a little water from the Ganges
and offers it back to the Ganges. When the devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose
anything, and when the water is offered back, mother Ganges does not increase, but in this way the
worshiper of the Ganges is benefited. Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers the Lord patram puspam
phalam toyam--a leaf, flower, fruit or water--in great devotion, but everything, including the leaf, flower,
fruit and water, belongs to the Lord, and therefore there is nothing to renounce or to accept. One must
simply take advantage of the bhakti process because by following this process one does not lose anything
but one gains the favor of the Supreme Person.

Because mother Ganges emanates from the lotus toe of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,

It has actually been seen that anyone who regularly worships mother Ganges simply by bathing in her
water keeps very good health and gradually becomes a devotee of the Lord. This is the effect of bathing in
the water of the Ganges. Bathing in the Ganges is recommended in all Vedic sastras, and one who takes to
this path will certainly be completely freed from all sinful reactions. The practical example of this is that
the sons of Maharaja Sagara went to the heavenly planets when water from the Ganges merely touched the

Bhagiratha had a son named Sruta, whose son was Nabha. This son was different from the Nabha
previously described. Nabha had a son named Sindhudvipa, from Sindhudvipa came Ayutayu, and from
Ayutayu came Rtuparna, who became a friend of Nalaraja. Rtuparna taught Nalaraja the art of gambling,
and Nalaraja gave Rtuparna lessons in controlling and maintaining horses. The son of Rtuparna was
Sarvakama.
Gambling is also an art. Ksatriyas are allowed to exhibit talent in this art of gambling. By the grace of
Krsna, the Pandavas lost everything by gambling and were deprived of their kingdom, wife, family and
home because they were not expert in the gambling art. In other words, a devotee may not be expert in
materialistic activities. It is therefore advised in the sastra that materialistic activities are not at all suitable
for the living entities, especially the devotees. A devotee should therefore be satisfied to eat whatever is
sent as prasada by the Supreme Lord. A devotee remains pure because he does not take to sinful activities
such as gambling, intoxication, meat-eating and illicit sex.

Thinking to harm the King, he became the cook at the King's house. One day, the King's spiritual master,
Vasistha Muni, was invited for dinner, and the Raksasa cook served him human flesh.

O King, O hero, this human body is meant for universal benefits. If you kill this body untimely, you will

Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:
hari hari viphale janama gonainu
manusya-janama paiya, radha-krsna na bhajiya,
janiya suniya visa khainu
The body of a human being is extremely valuable because in this body one can understand the
instructions of Krsna and attain the ultimate destination of the living entity. The living entity is within the
material world to fulfill the mission of going back home, back to Godhead. In the material world, one
hankers for happiness, but because one does not know the ultimate destination, one changes bodies one
after another. However, if one gets the opportunity to possess a human form of body, in this body he can
fulfill the four principles of dharma, artha, kama and moksa, and if one is properly regulated he makes
further progress, after liberation, to engage in the service of Radha and Krsna. This is the success of life: to
stop the process of repeated birth and death and go back home, back to Godhead (mam eti), to be
engaged in the service of Radha and Krsna. Therefore, taking a human body is meant for completing one's
progress in life. Throughout human society, killing of a human being is taken very seriously. Hundreds
and thousands of animals are killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of
even one human being is taken very seriously. Why? Because the human form of body is extremely
important in executing the mission of life.

Here is a learned, highly qualified brahmana, engaged in performing austerity and eagerly desiring to
worship the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul who lives within the core of the heart in all living entities.
The wife of the brahmana did not regard her husband as a superficial brahmana who was called a
brahmana merely because he was born of a brahmana family. Rather, this brahmana was actually qualified
with the brahminical symptoms. Yasya yal laksanam proktam (Bhag. 7.11.35). The symptoms of a
brahmana are stated in the sastra:
samo damas tapah saucam
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jnanam vijnanam astikyam
brahma-karma svabhavajam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness--
these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work." (Bg. 18.42) Not only must a brahmana be
qualified, but he must also engage in actual brahminical activities. Simply to be qualified is not enough;
one must engage in a brahmana's duties. The duty of a brahmana is to know the param brahma, Krsna
(param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan). Because this brahmana was actually qualified
and was also engaged in brahminical activities (brahma-karma), killing him would be a greatly sinful act,
and the brahmana's wife requested that he not be killed.

My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles. As a son never deserves to be killed by his
father, here is a brahmana who should be protected by the king, and never killed. How does he deserve to
be killed by a rajarsi like you?
The word rajarsi refers to a king who behaves like a rsi, or sage. Such a king is also called naradeva
because he is considered a representative of the Supreme Lord. Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to
maintain brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a brahmana. Generally, a brahmana, woman, child,
old man or cow is never regarded as punishable. Thus the wife of the brahmana requested the King to
refrain from this sinful act.

You are well known and worshiped in learned circles. How dare you kill this brahmana, who is a
saintly, sinless person, well versed in Vedic knowledge? Killing him would be like destroying the embryo
within the womb or killing a cow.
As stated in the Amara-kosa dictionary, bhruno'rbhake bala-garbhe: the word bhruna refers either to the
cow or to the living entity in embryo. According to Vedic culture, destroying the undeveloped embryo of
the soul in the womb is as sinful as killing a cow or a brahmana. In the embryo, the living entity is present
in an undeveloped stage. The modern scientific theory that life is a combination of chemicals is nonsense;
scientists cannot manufacture living beings, even like those born from eggs. The idea that scientists can
develop a chemical situation resembling that of an egg and bring life from it is nonsensical. Their theory
that a chemical combination can have life may be accepted, but these rascals cannot create such a
combination. This verse refers to bhrunasya vadham--the killing of a bhruna or destruction of the embryo.
Here is a challenge from the Vedic literature. The crude, atheistic understanding that the living entity is a
combination of matter belongs to the grossest ignorance.

Without my husband, I cannot live for a moment. If you want to eat my husband, it would be better to
eat me first, for without my husband I am as good as a dead body.
In the Vedic culture there is a system known as sati or saha-marana, in which a woman dies with her
husband. According to this system, if the husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the
blazing funeral pyre of her husband. Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in this culture are expressed
by the wife of the brahmana. A woman without a husband is like a dead body. Therefore according to
Vedic culture a girl must be married. This is the responsibility of her father. A girl may be given in
charity, and a husband may have more than one wife, but a girl must be married. This is Vedic culture. A
woman is supposed to be always dependent--in her childhood she is dependent on her father, in youth on
her husband, and in old age on her elderly sons. According to Manu-samhita, she is never independent.
Independence for a woman means miserable life. In this age, so many girls are unmarried and falsely
imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable. Here is an instance in which a woman felt that
without her husband she was nothing but a dead body.

This is an example of destiny. King Saudasa was condemned by the curse of Vasistha, and therefore
even though he was well qualified he could not restrain himself from becoming a tigerlike Raksasa, for
this was his destiny. Tal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham (Bhag. 1.5.18). As one is put into distress

yah--King Khatvanga who; devaih--by the demigods; arthitah--being requested; daityan--the demons;
avadhit--killed; yudhi--in a fight; durjayah--very fierce; muhurtam--for a second only; ayuh--duration of
life; jnatva--knowing; etya--approached; sva-puram--his own abode; sandadhe--fixed; manah--the mind.
King Khatvanga was unconquerable in any fight. Requested by the demigods to join them in fighting the
demons, he won victory, and the demigods, being very pleased, wanted to give him a benediction. The
King inquired from them about the duration of his life and was informed that he had only one moment
more. Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence, where he engaged his mind
fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.
The example of Maharaja Khatvanga in performing devotional service is brilliant. Maharaja Khatvanga
engaged himself for only a moment in devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to
Godhead. Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life, surely he will
return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (asamsaya).
In Bhagavad-gita the word asamsaya is used to describe the devotee. There the Lord Himself gives this
instruction:
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
"Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind
attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." (Bg. 7.1)
The Lord also instructs:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." (Bg. 4.9)
Therefore, from the very beginning of one's life one should practice bhakti-yoga, which increases one's
attachment for Krsna. If one daily sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity,
chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities of the Lord
as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to Krsna. This attachment is called asakti. When one's
mind is attached to Krsna (mayy asakta-manah), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth. If
one misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle
of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and the chance to return home,
back to Godhead. The most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving
service to the Lord.

Maharaja Khatvanga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me than the brahminical culture and the
brahmanas, who are worshiped by my family. What then is to be said of my kingdom, land, wife, children
and opulence? Nothing is dearer to me than the brahmanas.
Maharaja Khatvanga, being in favor of the brahminical culture, wanted to utilize one moment's time by
fully surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is worshiped with this prayer:
namo brahmanya-devaya
go brahmana-hitaya ca
jagad-dhitaya krsnaya
govindaya namo namah
"I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Krsna, who is the well-wisher of the
cows and the brahmanas as well as the living entities in general. I offer my repeated obeisances to
Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses." A devotee of Krsna is very much attached to
brahminical culture. Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Krsna is and what He wants is a real
brahmana. Brahma janatiti brahmanah. Krsna is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Krsna conscious
persons, or devotees of Krsna, are exalted brahmanas. Khatvanga Maharaja regarded the devotees of Krsna
as the real brahmanas and the real light for human society. One who desires to advance in Krsna
consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and
must understand Krsna (krsnaya govindaya). Then his life will be successful.

I was never attracted, even in my childhood, by insignificant things or irreligious principles. I did not
find anything more substantial than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Maharaja Khatvanga provides a typical example of a Krsna conscious person. A Krsna conscious person
does not see anything to be important but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept
anything within this material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord. As stated in Caitanyacaritamrta
(Madhya 8.274):
sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara murti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphurti
"The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he
does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the
Supreme Lord." Although a devotee is within the material world, he has no connection with it.
Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe. He accepts this material world in relationship with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. A devotee may be engaged in earning money, but he uses that money for
propagating the Krsna consciousness movement by constructing large temples and establishing worship of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Khatvanga Maharaja, therefore, was not a materialist. A materialist
is always attached to wife, children, home, property and many other things for sense gratification, but, as
stated above, Khatvanga Maharaja was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything
existing without the purpose of the Supreme Lord. Isavasyam idam sarvam: everything is related to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one
takes to the path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he can be trained in this
consciousness and attain perfect understanding. For a Krsna conscious person, nothing is palatable
without a relationship with Krsna.

Supreme Personality of Godhead (and therefore not interested in anything material).
The demigods, the directors of the three worlds, wanted to give me whatever benediction I desired. I did
not want their benedictions, however, because I am interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who created everything in this material world. I am more interested in the Supreme Personality of
Godhead than in all material benedictions.
A devotee is always transcendentally situated. param drstva nivartate: one who has seen the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is no longer interested in material sense enjoyment. Even such an exalted devotee
as Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction. He said, svamin krtartho
'smi varam na yace: "My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me.
I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service." This is the
mentality of a pure devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of
Godhead. Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore called krsna-bhavanamrta-sangha, the
association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Krsna. Being absorbed in thoughts of Krsna
is neither expensive nor troublesome. Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam
namaskuru: "Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me." (Bg. 9.34)
Anyone can always think of Krsna, without difficulties or obstacles. This is called krsna-bhavanamrta.
One who is absorbed in krsna-bhavanamrta has no material benefits to ask from Krsna. Instead, such a
person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories all over the world. Mama
janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. A Krsna conscious person does not even want to
stop his cycle of birth and death. He simply prays, "I may take birth as You like, but my only prayer is that
I may be engaged in Your service."

of the heart; sthitam--situated; na--not; vindanti--know; priyam--the dearmost Personality of Godhead;
sasvat--constantly, eternally; atmanam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kim uta--what to speak of;

Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated in the higher planetary system, their
minds, senses and intelligence are agitated by material conditions. Therefore, even such elevated persons
fail to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally situated in the core of the heart. What
then is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer advantages?
It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated in everyone's heart (isvarah sarvabhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this
material world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is situated so near to us. For those
always agitated by material conditions, the yogic process is recommended so that one may concentrate his
mind upon the Supreme personality of Godhead within the heart. Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa
pasyanti yam yoginah. Because in material conditions the mind and senses are always agitated, by the
yogic procedures like dharana, asana and dhyana one must quiet the mind and concentrate it upon the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the
Lord, whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to realize Him. Maharaja
Khatvanga accepted the spiritual path, and therefore he was no longer interested in anything material.
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: "Only by devotional service can I be
understood." One can understand Krsna, the Parabrahman, the Supreme personality of Godhead, only
through devotional service. The Lord never says that one can understand Him by performing mystic yoga
or by philosophically speculating. Bhakti is above all such material attempts. Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnanakarmady-
anavrtam. Bhakti is uncontaminated, being unalloyed even by jnana or pious activities.

Therefore I should now give up my attachment for things created by the external energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. I should engage in thought of the Lord and should thus surrender unto Him.
This material creation, having been created by the external energy of the Lord, is like an imaginary town
visualized on a hill or in a forest. Every conditioned soul has a natural attraction and attachment for
material things, but one must simply give up this attachment and surrender unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may sometimes see a city in the sky
with towers and palaces, or one may see similar things in a big forest. This is called a gandharva-pura, a
phantasmagoria. This entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and every materially situated person
has attachment for it. But Khatvanga Maharaja, because of his advanced Krsna consciousness, was not
interested in such things. Even though a devotee may engage in apparently materialistic activities, he
knows his position very well. Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate. If one engages all
material things in relation with the loving service of the Lord, one is situated in yukta-vairagya, proper
renunciation. In this material world, nothing should be accepted for one's sense gratification: everything
should be accepted for the service of the Lord. This is the mentality of the spiritual world. Maharaja
Khatvanga advises that one give up material attachments and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Thus one achieves success in life. This is pure bhakti-yoga, which involves vairagya-vidya--
renunciation and knowledge.

"Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared now as Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and has come down to teach us material detachment, learning
and devotional service to Himself." (Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka 6.74) Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu
inaugurated this movement of vairagya-vidya, by which one detaches himself from material existence and
engages in loving devotional service. The Krsna consciousness movement of devotional service is the only
process by which to counteract our false prestige in this material world.

When one actually becomes purely Krsna conscious, no one has any right to rule over him. When
situated in Krsna consciousness, one is no longer in the darkness of ignorance, and when freed from all
such darkness, one is situated in his original position. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa.' The

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, Krsna, is extremely difficult to understand for
unintelligent men who accept Him as impersonal or void, which He is not. The Lord is therefore
understood and sung about by pure devotees.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases--as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan. Bhagavan is the
origin of everything. Brahman is a partial representation of Bhagavan, and Vasudeva, the Supersoul living
everywhere and in everyone's heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. But when one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vasudevah samam
iti), when one realizes that Vasudeva is both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in
perfect knowledge. Krsna is therefore described by Arjuna as param brahma param dhama pavitram
paramam bhavan. The words param brahma refer to the shelter of the impersonal Brahman and also of the
all-pervading Supersoul. When Krsna says tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti, this means that the
perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead. Maharaja Khatvanga accepted
the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his full surrender he achieved
perfection.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Amsuman."
Chapter Ten
The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Ramacandra
This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra appeared in the dynasty of Maharaja Khatvanga. It
also describes the Lord's activities, telling how He killed Ravana and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of
His kingdom.
The son of Maharaja Khatvanga was Dirghabahu, and his son was Raghu. The son of Raghu was Aja, the
son of Aja was Dasaratha, and the son of Dasaratha was Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion--as Lord
Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna--great sages like Valmiki who were actually in knowledge
of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes these
pastimes in brief.
Lord Ramacandra went with Visvamitra and killed Raksasas like Marica. After breaking the stout and
strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sita and cut down the prestige of Parasurama.
To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Laksmana and Sita. There He cut
off the nose of Surpanakha and killed the associates of Ravana, headed by Khara and Dusana. Ravana's
kidnapping of Sitadevi was the beginning of this demon's misfortune. When Marica assumed the form of a
golden deer, Lord Ramacandra went to bring the deer to please Sitadevi, but in the meantime Ravana took
advantage of the Lord's absence to kidnap her. When Sitadevi was kidnapped, Lord Ramacandra,
accompanied by Laksmana, searched for her throughout the forest. In the course of this search, They met
Jatayu. Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vali and established a friendly
relationship with Sugriva. After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to
the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra
did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry. Then Samudra came to the Lord with great
haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way. The Lord then attempted to bridge the
ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhisana, He attacked Ravana's capital, Lanka. Previously,
Hanuman, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Lanka, and now, with the help of Laksmana, the
forces of Lord Ramacandra killed all the Raksasa soldiers. Then Lord Ramacandra personally killed
Ravana. Mandodari and other wives lamented for Ravana, and in accordance with Lord Ramacandra's
order, Vibhisana performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family. Lord Ramacandra then
gave Vibhisana the right to rule Lanka and also granted him a long duration of life. The Lord delivered
Sitadevi from the Asoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhya, where He was
received by His brother Bharata. When Lord Ramacandra entered Ayodhya, Bharata brought His wooden
shoes, Vibhisana and Sugriva held a whisk and fan, Hanuman carried an umbrella, Satrughna carried the
Lord's bow and two quivers, and Sitadevi carried a waterpot containing water from holy places. Angada
carried a sword, and Jambavan (Rksaraja) carried a shield. After Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Lord
Laksmana and mother Sitadevi, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasistha enthroned Him as King. The
chapter ends with a short description of Lord Ramacandra's rule in Ayodhya.

of Maharaja Dasaratha.
Lord Ramacandra and His brothers, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, are all visnu-tattva, not jivatattva.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into many, many forms. Advaitam acyutam anadim

confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.39), ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan. The Lord is situated in
many forms, such as Rama, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, and these forms may exist in any part of
His creation. All these forms exist permanently, eternally, as individual Personalities of Godhead, and they
resemble many candles, all equally powerful. Lord Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna, who,
being visnu-tattva, are all equally powerful, became the sons of Maharaja Dasaratha in response to prayers

O King Pariksit, the transcendental activities of Lord Ramacandra have been described by great saintly
persons who have seen the truth. Because you have heard again and again about Lord Ramacandra, the
husband of mother Sita, I shall describe these activities only in brief. Please listen.
Modern Raksasas, posing as educationally advanced merely because they have doctorates, have tried to
prove that Lord Ramacandra is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person. But those
who are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the descriptions
of Lord Ramacandra and His activities only as presented by tattva-darsis, those who know the Absolute
Truth. In Bhagavad-gita (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
Unless one is tattva-darsi, in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the activities
of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore although there are many so-called Ramayanas, or histories of
Lord Ramacandra's activities, some of them are not actually authoritative. Sometimes Lord Ramacandra's
activities are described in terms of one's own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments. But the
characteristics of Lord Ramacandra should not be handled as something imaginary. While describing the
history of Lord Ramacandra, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit, "You have already heard about
the activities of Lord Ramacandra." Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago there were many
Ramayanas, or histories of Lord Ramacandra's activities, and there are many still. But we must select only
those books written by tattva-darsis (jnaninas tattva-darsinah), not the books of so-called scholars who
claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate. This is a warning by Sukadeva Gosvami. Rsibhis tattvadarsibhih.
Although the Ramayana composed by Valmiki is a huge literature, the same activities are
summarized here by Sukadeva Gosvami in a few verses.

To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Ramacandra immediately gave up the position of king
and, accompanied by His wife, mother Sita, wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which
were so delicate that they were unable to bear even the touch of Sita's palms. The Lord was also
accompanied by Hanuman [or by another monkey, Sugriva], king of the monkeys, and by His own
younger brother Lord Laksmana, both of whom gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the
forest. Having cut off the nose and ears of Surpanakha, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from
mother Sita. He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who then
allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean. Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of
Ravana to kill him, like a fire devouring a forest. May that Supreme Lord, Ramacandra, give us all
protection.

O King, the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra were wonderful, like those of a baby elephant. In the
assembly where mother Sita was to choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke
the bow belonging to Lord Siva. This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but
Lord Ramacandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant breaks a stick of
sugarcane. Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother Sita, who was equally as endowed with
transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature. Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune
who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord. While returning from Sita's home after gaining her at the
assembly of competitors, Lord Ramacandra met Parasurama. Although Parasurama was very proud,
having rid the earth of the royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be
a ksatriya of the royal order.

Carrying out the order of His father, who was bound by a promise to his wife, Lord Ramacandra left
behind His kingdom, opulence, friends, well-wishers, residence and everything else, just as a liberated
soul gives up his life, and went to the forest with Sita.
Maharaja Dasaratha had three wives. One of them, Kaikeyi, served him very pleasingly, and he therefore
wanted to give her a benediction. Kaikeyi, however, said that she would ask for the benediction when it
was necessary. At the time of the coronation of Prince Ramacandra, Kaikeyi requested her husband to
enthrone her son Bharata and send Ramacandra to the forest. Maharaja Dasaratha, being bound by his
promise, ordered Ramacandra to go to the forest, according to the dictation of his beloved. And the Lord,
as an obedient son, accepted the order immediately. He left everything without hesitation, just as a
liberated soul or great yogi gives up his life without material attraction.

raksah-adhamena--by the most wicked among Raksasas, Ravana; vrka-vat--like a tiger; vipine--in the
forest; asamaksam--unprotected; vaideha-raja-duhitari--by this condition of mother Sita, the daughter of
the King of Videha; apayapitayam--having been kidnapped; bhratra--with His brother; vane--in the forest;

persons attracted to or connected with women; gatim--destination; iti--thus; prathayan--giving an

When Ramacandra entered the forest and Laksmana was also absent, the worst of the Raksasas, Ravana,
kidnapped Sitadevi, the daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the
shepherd is absent. Then Lord Ramacandra wandered in the forest with His brother Laksmana as if very
much distressed due to separation from His wife. Thus He showed by His personal example the condition
of a person attached to women.
In this verse the words stri-sanginam gatim iti indicate that the condition of a person attached to women
was shown by the Lord Himself. According to moral instructions, grhe narim vivarjayet: when one goes
on a tour, one should not bring his wife. Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still, as
far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a
condition as Lord Ramacandra when banished by the order of His father. Whether in the forest or at
home, if one is attached to women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by His personal example.
Of course, this is the material side of stri-sangi, but the situation of Lord Ramacandra is spiritual, for He
does not belong to the material world. Narayanah paro 'vyaktat: Narayana is beyond the material creation.
Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of the material world.
The separation of Lord Ramacandra from Sita is spiritually understood as vipralambha, which is an
activity of the hladini potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the srngara-rasa, the
mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead
has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms called sattvika, sancari, vilapa, murccha and
unmada. Thus when Lord Ramacandra was separated from Sita, all these spiritual symptoms were
manifested. The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent. Rather, He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, the
eternal form of knowledge and bliss. Thus He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss. Feeling separation
from one's beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss. As explained by Srila Svarupa Damodara Gosvami,
radha-krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini-saktih: the dealings of love between Radha and Krsna are displayed as
the pleasure potency of the Lord. The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all
pleasure. Lord Ramacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and materially. Materially
those who are attached to women suffer, but spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the
Lord and His pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases. This is further explained in
Bhagavad-gita (9.11):
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead thinks of the Lord
as an ordinary human being. But the Lord's mind, intelligence and senses can never be affected by
material conditions. This fact is further explained in the Skanda purana, as quoted by Madhvacarya:
nitya-purna-sukha-jnanasvarupo
'sau yato vibhuh
ato 'sya rama ity akhya
tasya duhkham kuto 'nv api
tathapi loka-siksartham
aduhkho duhkha-vartivat

It was actually impossible for Ravana to take away Sita. The form of Sita taken by Ravana was an illusory
representation of mother Sita--maya-sita. When Sita was tested in the fire, this maya-sita was burnt, and
the real Sita came out of the fire.
A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a woman, however powerful she may be
in the material world, must be given protection, for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited by
Raksasas like Ravana. Here the words vaideha-raja-duhitari indicate that before mother Sita was married
to Lord Ramacandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-raja. And when she was married she was
protected by her husband. Therefore the conclusion is that a woman should always be protected.
According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman's being independent (asamaksam), for a
woman cannot protect herself independently.

Lord then killed the demon named Kabandha, and after making friends with the monkey chiefs, killing
Vali and arranging for the deliverance of mother Sita, He went to the beach of the ocean.
When Ravana kidnapped Sita, he was obstructed on the way by Jatayu, a large bird. But the powerful
Ravana defeated Jatayu in the fight and cut his wing. When Ramacandra was searching for Sita, He found
Jatayu almost dead and was informed that Sita has been carried off by Ravana. When Jatayu died, Lord
Ramacandra did the duty of a son by performing the funeral ceremony, and then He made friends with the
monkeys to deliver Sitadevi.

by fear. Then the personified ocean fearfully approached Lord Ramacandra, taking all paraphernalia to
worship Him. Falling at the Lord's lotus feet, the personified ocean spoke as follows.

with the mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of ignorance, but You are the master of all
these qualities.
The word jada-dhiyah refers to intelligence like that of an animal. A person with such intelligence
cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being beaten, an animal cannot
understand the purpose of a man. Similarly, those who are dull-minded cannot understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but when punished severely by the modes of material nature, they begin to
understand Him. A Hindi poet has said:
duhkha se saba hari bhaje
sukha se bhaje koi
sukha se agar hari bhaje
duhkha kathan se haya
When one is distressed he goes to the church or temple to worship the Lord, but when opulent he
forgets the Lord. Therefore, punishment by the Lord through material nature is necessary in human
society, for without it men forget the supremacy of the Lord due to their dull, blunt intelligence.

My Lord, You may use my water as You like. Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of Ravana,
who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds. He is the son of Visrava, but is
condemned like urine. Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sitadevi. O great hero, although my
water presents no impediment to Your going to Lanka, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your
transcendental fame. Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes
and kings in the future will glorify You.
It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source--the genitals. When a son is a devotee or a
great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified
and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine. Here Ravana is compared to urine because he
was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds. Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord
Ramacandra.
One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra is omnipotence. The Lord can act
without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme
personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He
constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean. Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some
artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into
selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is. Lord Ramacandra,
however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float. This is proof of God's
uncommonly wonderful power. Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying
extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord
Ramacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept
Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only
seven years old. We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays
special features in His various activities. Therefore, the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." The activities of
the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed by any
other living being. The symptoms of the Lord's activities are all mentioned in the sastras, and after one
understands them one can accept the Lord as He is.

Sukadeva Gosvami said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by throwing into the water the peaks
of mountains whose trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord
Ramacandra went to Lanka to release Sitadevi from the clutches of Ravana. With the direction and help of
Vibhisana, Ravana's brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers, headed by Sugriva, Nila and
Hanuman, entered Ravana's kingdom, Lanka, which had previously been burnt by Hanuman.
Great mountain peaks covered with trees and plants were thrown into the sea by the monkey soldiers
and began to float by the supreme will of the Lord. By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets
float weightlessly in space like swabs of cotton. If this is possible, why should great mountain peaks not
be able to float on water? This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can do
anything and everything He likes, because He is not under the control of the material nature; indeed,
material nature is controlled by Him. Mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram: only under His
direction does prakrti, or material nature, work. Similar information is given in the Brahma-samhita
(5.52):
yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Describing how material nature works, the Brahma-samhita says that the sun moves as desired by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently, for Lord Ramacandra to construct a bridge over the
Indian Ocean with the help of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks into the water is not at
all wonderful; it is wonderful only in the sense that it has kept the name and fame of Lord Ramacandra
eternally celebrated.

waterpots on its domes were all destroyed, the entire city of Lanka appeared like a river disturbed by a
herd of elephants.

Angada and the other commanders of the soldiers of Ramacandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses
and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows. Thus the
soldiers of Lord Ramacandra killed Ravana's soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Ravana had
been condemned by the anger of mother Sita.
The soldiers Lord Ramacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and did not have proper
equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Ravana, for Ravana's soldiers were equipped with weapons
of modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees. It was only
Lord Ramacandra and Laksmana who shot some arrows. But because the soldiers of Ravana were
condemned by the curse of mother Sita, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by throwing stones
and trees. There are two kinds of strength--daiva and purusakara. Daiva refers to the strength achieved
from the Transcendence, and purusakara refers to the strength organized by one's own intelligence and
power. Transcendental power is always superior to the power of the materialist. Depending on the mercy
of the Supreme Lord, one must fight one's enemies even though one may not be equipped with modern
weapons. Therefore Krsna instructed Arjuna, mam anusmara yudhya ca: "Think of Me and fight." We
should fight our enemy to the best of our ability, but for victory we must depend on the mercy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

but I, being omnipotent, never fail in My attempt.
Lord Ramacandra said to Ravana: You are the most abominable of the man-eaters. Indeed, you are like
their stool. You resemble a dog, for as a dog steals eatables from the kitchen in the absence of the
householder, in My absence you kidnapped My wife, Sitadevi. Therefore as Yamaraja punishes sinful men,
I shall also punish you. You are most abominable, sinful and shameless. Today, therefore, I, whose
attempt never fails, shall punish you.
Na ca daivat param balam: no one can surpass the strength of the Transcendence. Ravana was so sinful
and shameless that he did not know what the result would be of kidnapping mother Sita, the pleasure
potency of Ramacandra. This is the disqualification of the Raksasas. Asatyam apratistham te jagad ahur
anisvaram. The Raksasas are unaware that the Supreme Lord is the ruler of the creation. They think that
everything has come about by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or controller. Therefore
the Raksasas act independently, as they like, going even so far as to kidnap the goddess of fortune. This
policy of Ravana's is extremely dangerous for the materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the materialistic
civilization. Nonetheless, because atheists are Raksasas, they dare to do things that are most abominable,
and thus they are punished without fail. Religion consists of the orders of the Supreme Lord, and one who
carries out these orders is religious. One who fails to carry out the Lord's orders is irreligious, and he is to
be punished.

After thus rebuking Ravana, Lord Ramacandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at Ravana, and released
the arrow, which pierced Ravana's heart like a thunderbolt. Upon seeing this, Ravana's followers raised a
tumultuous sound, crying, "Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?" as Ravana, vomiting
blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly
planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.
In Bhagavad-gita (9.21) it is said, ksine punye martya-lokam visanti: "When the results of their pious
activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth." The fruitive
activities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain
within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can
relieve one from maya's clutches of repeated birth and death. Somehow or other, Ravana was raised to an
exalted position as the king of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of
kidnapping mother Sita, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed. If one offends an exalted
personality, especially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable;
bereft of the results of pious activities, one must fall down like Ravana and other demons. It is therefore
advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the pure state of freedom from
all designations (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam). When one is fixed in devotional
service, he is above the material platform. On the material platform there are higher and lower positions,
but when one is above the material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (sa gunan
samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). Ravana or those like him may be very powerful and opulent in
this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of
their karma (karmana daiva-netrena). We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws
of nature.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27) One should not be proud of
one's exalted position and act like Ravana, thinking oneself independent of material nature's laws.

O greatly fortunate one, you came under the influence of lusty desires, and therefore you could not
understand the influence of mother Sita. Now, because of her curse, you have been reduced to this state,
having been killed by Lord Ramacandra.
Not only was mother Sita powerful, but any woman who follows in the footsteps of mother Sita can also
become similarly powerful. There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever
we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sita is among them. Mandodari, the wife of Ravana,
was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadi was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow
great personalities like Brahma and Narada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sita,
Mandodari and Draupadi. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with
supernatural power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another's
wife. Matrvat para-daresu: an intelligent person must look upon another's wife as being like his mother.
This is a moral injunction from Canakya-sloka (10).
matrvat para-daresu
para-dravyesu lostravat
atmavat sarva-bhutesu
yah pasyati sa panditah
"One who considers another's wife as his mother, another's possessions as a lump of dirt and treats all
other living beings as he would himself, is considered to be learned." Thus Ravana was condemned not
only by Lord Ramacandra but even by his own wife, Mandodari. Because she was a chaste woman, she
knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sitadevi.

O pleasure of the Raksasa dynasty, because of you the state of Lanka and also we ourselves now have no
protector. By your deeds you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul fit to go to
hell.
One who follows the path of Ravana is condemned in two ways: his body is fit to be eaten by dogs and
vultures, and the soul goes to hell. As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." Thus the destination of godless atheists such
as Ravana, Hiranyakasipu, Kamsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of life. Mandodari, the wife of
Ravana, could understand all this because she was a chaste woman. Although lamenting for the death of
her husband, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly
with one's material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (pasyanti jnana-caksusah). In Vedic history
there are many instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature.

received approval from Lord Ramacandra, the King of Kosala. Then he performed the prescribed funeral
ceremonies for his family members to save them from the path to hell.
After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is
checked from transmigrating to another body, and thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person
from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or sraddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized sastra, must be
performed. Ravana was killed by Lord Ramacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord
Ramacandra's advice, Vibhisana, Ravana's brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the
dead. Thus Lord Ramacandra was kind to Ravana even after Ravana's death.

When Lord Bharata understood that Lord Ramacandra was returning to the capital, Ayodhya, He
immediately took upon His own head Lord Ramacandra's wooden shoes and came out from His camp at
Nandigrama. Lord Bharata was accompanied by ministers, priests and other respectable citizens, by
professional musicians vibrating pleasing musical sounds, and by learned brahmanas loudly chanting
Vedic hymns. Following in the procession were chariots drawn by beautiful horses with harnesses of
golden rope. These chariots were decorated by flags with golden embroidery and by other flags of various
sizes and patterns. There were soldiers bedecked with golden armor, servants bearing betel nut, and many
well-known and beautiful prostitutes. Many servants followed on foot, bearing an umbrella, whisks,
different grades of precious jewels, and other paraphernalia befitting a royal reception. Accompanied in
this way, Lord Bharata, His heart softened in ecstasy and His eyes full of tears, approached Lord
Ramacandra and fell at His lotus feet with great ecstatic love.

them; pitr-vat--exactly like a father; ramah--Lord Ramacandra; menire--they considered; pitaram--exactly
like a father; ca--also; tam--Him, Lord Ramacandra.
Being pleased by the full surrender and submission of Lord Bharata, Lord Ramacandra then accepted the
throne of the state. He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in
their occupational duties of varna and asrama, accepted Him as their father.
People are very fond of the pattern of Rama-rajya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party
called Rama-rajya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Rama. It is sometimes said that
people want the kingdom of God without God. Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled. Good
government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that
exemplified by Lord Ramacandra and His citizens. Lord Ramacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a
father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord
Ramacandra, accepted the Lord as their father. Thus the relationship between the citizens and the
government should be exactly like that between father and son. When the sons in a family are well
trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good
care of the children. As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-nirata varnasrama-gunan-vitah, the
people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of varna and asrama, which arranges
society in the varna divisions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra and the asrama divisions of
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. This is actual human civilization. People must be
trained according to the different varnasrama occupational duties. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.13),
catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four varnas must be established according to
varying qualities and work. The first principle for good government is that it must institute this
varnasrama system. The purpose of varnasrama is to enable people to become God conscious.
Varnasramacaravata purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate. The entire varnasrama scheme is intended
to enable people to become Vaisnavas. Visnur asya devata. When people worship Lord Visnu as the
Supreme Lord, they become Vaisnavas. Thus people should be trained to become Vaisnavas through the
system of varna and asrama, as they were during the reign of Lord Ramacandra, when everyone was fully
trained to follow the varnasrama principles.
Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful. That is impossible.
Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the
citizens are rogues and thieves. Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be
trained. As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or
specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students
to become brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis. This
will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (varnasrama-gunan-vitah). Generally
speaking, if the king or president is a rajarsi, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive
will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and
rogues will decrease. In Kali-yuga, however, because the varnasrama system is neglected, people are
generally thieves and rogues. In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money
from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy. But
here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Ramacandra. If people follow
this example, there will be good government all over the world.

Lord Ramacandra became King during Treta-yuga, but because of His good government, the age was
like Satya-yuga. Everyone was religious and completely happy.
Among the four yugas--Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali--the Kali-yuga is the worst, but if the process of
varnasrama-dharma is introduced, even in this age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be invoked. The
Hare Krsna movement, or Krsna consciousness movement, is meant for this purpose.
kaler dosa-nidhe rajann
asti hy eko mahan gunah

"My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply
by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted
to the transcendental kingdom." (Bhag. 12.3.51) If people take to this sankirtana movement of chanting
Hare Krsna, Hare Rama, they will certainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people
of this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age. Anyone, anywhere, can easily take
to this Hare Krsna movement; one need only chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, observe the rules and
regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life. Even if one is sinful and cannot give up
sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly
be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful. Param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam.
This is the blessing of Lord Ramacandra, who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.

All these facilities existed because of Lord Ramacandra's presence as the King of the entire world. A
similar situation could be introduced immediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages. It is
said, kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy name--
Hare Krsna, Hare Rama. If we chant offenselessly, Rama and Krsna are still present in this age. The
kingdom of Rama was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Krsna movement

Lord Ramacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no connection with any other women.
He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger. He
taught good behavior for everyone, especially for householders, in terms of varnasrama-dharma. Thus He
taught the general public by His personal activities.
Eka-patni-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by Lord Ramacandra. One
should not accept more than one wife. In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife.
Even Lord Ramacandra's father accepted more wives than one. But Lord Ramacandra, as an ideal king,
accepted only one wife, mother Sita. When mother Sita was kidnapped by Ravana and the Raksasas, Lord
Ramacandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of
Sitas, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with Ravana and finally killed him. The
Lord punished Ravana and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife. Lord Ramacandra
accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders. A
householder should live according to the ideal of Lord Ramacandra, who showed how to be a perfect
person. Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives
according to the regulative principles of varnasrama-dharma. Those who live in accordance with these
principles, whether as householders, brahmacaris or vanaprasthas, are all equally important.

combination makes family life very happy. Yad yad acarati sresthas tat tad evetaro janah: whatever
example a great man sets, common people follow. If the kings, the leaders, and the brahmanas, the

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Pastimes of the Supreme Lord, Ramacandra."
Chapter Eleven
Lord Ramacandra Rules the World
This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with His younger brothers and
performed various sacrifices.
Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to
worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma
priests. He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance
He gave to the acarya. Lord Ramacandra's faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was
observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had
taken from Him. They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their
hearts as a sufficient contribution. Lord Ramacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary
person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him. By
chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man's house. In the course
of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi. The Lord immediately
returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sitadevi's company. Thus
He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin
sons, named Lava and Kusa. In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada and Citraketu, Bharata
begot two sons named Taksa and Puskala, and Satrughna begot two sons named Subahu and Srutasena.
When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Ramacandra, He fought
many millions of Gandharvas. By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then
brought home. Satrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of
Mathura. Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the
earth. Upon hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices
for thirteen thousand years. After describing the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra's disappearance and
establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by
describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Ramacandra and by describing how the Lord
protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.

supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality." Performing
yajna involves worshiping the Supreme Lord. Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord.
Therefore it is said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself. This does not,
of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The jiva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord. The living entities
(vibhinnamsa) never become one with the Lord, although Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord's
worship of Himself. Lord Krsna meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord
Ramacandra performed yajnas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being
should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahangraha-upasana. Such unauthorized worship is not
recommended herein.

All the brahmanas who were engaged in the various activities of the sacrifice were very pleased with
Lord Ramacandra, who was greatly affectionate and favorable to the brahmanas. Thus with melted hearts
they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.
In the previous chapter it was said that the prajas, the citizens, strictly followed the system of
varnasrama-dharma. The brahmanas acted exactly like brahmanas, the ksatriyas exactly like ksatriyas, and
so on. Therefore, when Lord Ramacandra gave everything in charity to the brahmanas, the brahmanas,
being qualified, wisely considered that brahmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from
it. The qualifications of a brahmana are given in Bhagavad-gita (18.42):.
samo damas tapah saucam
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jnanam vijnanam astikyam
brahma-karma svabhavajam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness--
these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work." The brahminical character offers no scope for
possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a ksatriya. Therefore, although the brahmanas
did not refuse Lord Ramacandra's gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King. The brahmanas were
so pleased with Lord Ramacandra's affection toward them that their hearts melted. They saw that Lord
Ramacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a ksatriya and
was exemplary in character. One of the qualifications of a ksatriya is to be charitable. A ksatriya, or ruler,
levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases.
Danam isvara-bhavah. On one hand, ksatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very
liberal with charity. When Maharaja Yudhisthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of
distributing it. Karna was very famous as Data Karna. The word data refers to one who gives charity very
liberally. The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any
scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity. A ksatriya's duty is to give charity, and a
brahmana's duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together.
Therefore, when the brahmanas were given so much land by Lord Ramacandra, they returned it to Him
and were not greedy.

O Lord, You are the master of the entire universe. What have You not given to us? You have entered the

When Dhruva Maharaja was offered a benediction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he replied,
"O my Lord, I am fully satisfied. I do not need any material benediction." Similarly, when Prahlada
Maharaja was offered a benediction by Lord Nrsimhadeva, he also refused to accept it and instead
declared that a devotee should not be like a vanik, a mercantile man who gives something in exchange for
some profit. One who becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee. Brahmanas are
always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart (sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca). And because the brahmanas and Vaisnavas are always
directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth. What is
absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom. An example of this was
given by Vamanadeva. Acting as a brahmacari, Lord Vamanadeva wanted only three paces of land.
Aspiring to possess more and more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance
is conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brahmana or Vaisnava.

After hearing the news of mother Sita's entering the earth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was

qualities of mother Sita, He could not check His grief in transcendental love.
Lord Ramacandra's grief at the news of Sitadevi's entering the earth is not to be considered material. In
the spiritual world also there are feelings of separation, but such feelings are considered spiritual bliss.
Grief in separation exists even in the Absolute, but such feelings of separation in the spiritual world are
transcendentally blissful. Such feelings are a sign of tasya prema-vasyatva-svabhava, being under the
influence of hladini-sakti and being controlled by love. In the material world such feelings of separation
are only a perverted reflection.

As explained above, when the feelings of love and transcendental bliss from the spiritual world are
pervertedly reflected in this material world, they are certainly the cause of bondage. As long as men feel
attracted to women in this material world and women feel attracted to men, the bondage of repeated birth
and death will continue. But in the spiritual world, where there is no fear of birth and death, such feelings
of separation are the cause of transcendental bliss. In the absolute reality there are varieties of feeling, but

After completing the sacrifice, Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus feet were sometimes pierced by thorns
when He lived in Dandakaranya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him.
Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuntha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.
The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for devotees. Sometimes when Lord
Ramacandra wandered in the forest of Dandakaranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet. The devotees, upon
thinking of this, would faint. The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this
material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord's lotus feet by a thorn. This
was the attitude of the gopis when they thought of Krsna wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains
of sand pricking His lotus feet. This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmis,
jnanis or yogis. The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord's lotus feet being pricked
by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord's disappearance, for the Lord had to
return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.
The word atma-jyotih is significant. The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by jnanis, or monistic
philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord's body.

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power. The glowing effulgence of
His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which
displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of
universes." (Brahma-samhita 5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond
the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planets. In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuntha
planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun. To enter the sun planet, one must go through the
sunshine. Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planets, they go through the
brahmajyoti. The jnanis, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord,
cannot enter the Vaikuntha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti. Thus after
some time they fall again to this material world. Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho
'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag. 10.2.32). The Vaikuntha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and
therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuntha planets are unless one is a pure devotee.

Lord Ramacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no need to take help from the monkeys

"The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for
everything is done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies." The Lord has nothing to do
(na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime. The Lord has no duty to perform
to oblige anyone. Nonetheless, He appears to act to protect His devotees or kill His enemies. Of course, no
one can be the Lord's enemy, since who could be more powerful than the Lord? There is actually no
question of anyone's being His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes
down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious activities
to please the devotees. His devotees always want to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and
therefore, to please Himself and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform
wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.

sa yaih sprsto 'bhidrsto va
samvisto 'nugato 'pi va
kosalas te yayuh sthanam
yatra gacchanti yoginah
sah--He, Lord Ramacandra; yaih--by which persons; sprstah--touched; abhidrstah--seen; va--either;
samvistah--eating together, lying together; anugatah--followed as servants; api va--even; kosalah--all those
inhabitants of Kosala; te--they; yayuh--departed; sthanam--to the place; yatra--wherein; gacchanti--they
go; yoginah--all the bhakti-yogis.
Lord Ramacandra returned to His abode, to which bhakti-yogis are promoted. This is the place to which
all the inhabitants of Ayodhya went after they served the Lord in His manifest pastimes by offering Him
obeisances, touching His lotus feet, fully observing Him as a fatherlike King, sitting or lying down with
Him like equals, or even just accompanying Him.
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Here this is
confirmed. All the inhabitants of Ayodhya who saw Lord Ramacandra as citizens, served Him as servants,
sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home,
back to Godhead. After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters
that particular universe where Lord Ramacandra or Lord Krsna is engaged in His pastimes. Then, after
being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakata-lila, the devotee is finally promoted to
sanatana-dhama, the supreme abode in the spiritual world. This sanatana-dhama is also mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita (paras tasmat tu bhavo 'nyo'vyakto'vyaktat sanatanah). One who enters the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-lila-pravista. To understand clearly why Lord Ramacandra returned, it
is mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the bhakti-yogis go. The
impersonalists misunderstand the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that the Lord entered His
own effulgence and therefore become impersonal. But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are persons.
Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past, they are persons in the present, and
they will continue to be persons even after giving up the body. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.

puruso rama-caritam
sravanair upadharayan
anrsamsya-paro rajan
karma-bandhair vimucyate
purusah--any person; rama-caritam--the narration concerning the activities of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead Lord Ramacandra; sravanaih--by aural reception; upadharayan--simply by this process of
hearing; anrsamsya-parah--becomes completely free from envy; rajan--O King Pariksit; karma-bandhaih--
by the bondage of fruitive activities; vimucyate--one becomes liberated.
O King Pariksit, anyone who aurally receives the narrations concerning the characteristics of Lord
Ramacandra's pastimes will ultimately be freed from the disease of envy and thus be liberated from the
bondage of fruitive activities.
Here in this material world, everyone is envious of someone else. Even in religious life, it is sometimes
found that if one devotee has advanced in spiritual activities, other devotees are envious of him. Such
envious devotees are not completely freed from the bondage of birth and death. As long as one is not
completely free from the cause of birth and death, one cannot enter the sanatana-dhama or the eternal
pastimes of the Lord. One becomes envious because of being influenced by the designations of the body,
but the liberated devotee has nothing to do with the body, and therefore he is completely on the
transcendental platform. A devotee is never envious of anyone, even his enemy. Because the devotee
knows that the Lord is his supreme protector, he thinks, "What harm can the so-called enemy do?" Thus
a devotee is confident about his protection. The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva
bhajamy aham: "According to the proportion of one's surrender unto Me, I respond accordingly." A
devotee must therefore be completely free from envy, especially of other devotees. To envy other devotees
is a great offense, a vaisnava-aparadha. A devotee who constantly engages in hearing and chanting
(sravana-kirtana) is certainly freed from the disease of envy, and thus he becomes eligible to go back
home, back to Godhead.

purim aiksata sanugah
sri-badarayanih uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; atha--hereafter (when the Lord accepted the throne
on the request of Bharata); adisat--ordered; dik-vijaye--to conquer all the world; bhratrn--His younger
brothers; tri-bhuvana-isvarah--the Lord of the universe; atmanam--personally, Himself; darsayan--giving
audience; svanam--to the family members and the citizens; purim--the city; aiksata--supervised; saanugah--
with other assistants.
Sukadeva Gosvami replied: After accepting the throne of the government by the fervent request of His
younger brother Bharata, Lord Ramacandra ordered His younger brothers to go out and conquer the
entire world, while He personally remained in the capital to give audience to all the citizens and residents
of the palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other assistants.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or assistants to be engaged in
sense gratification. The younger brothers of Lord Ramacandra were at home enjoying the personal
presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve
victory all over the world. It was the custom (and this custom, in some places, is still current) that all
other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the emperor. If the king of a small state did not accept
the emperor's supremacy, there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to
accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the country.
Lord Ramacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go out. Many of the Lord's
devotees residing in Vrndavana have taken the vow not to leave Vrndavana to preach Krsna
consciousness. But the Lord says that Krsna consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every
village and every town. This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
A pure devotee, therefore, must execute the order of the Lord and must not gratify his senses by
remaining stagnant in one place, falsely proud, thinking that because he does not leave Vrndavana but
chants in a solitary place he has become a great devotee. A devotee must carry out the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa. Every
devotee, therefore, should spread Krsna consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept
the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam
saranam vraja: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This is the order of the
Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor. Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for this is
victory (dig-vijaya). And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone this
philosophy of life.
Of course, those who are kanistha-adhikaris do not preach, but the Lord shows mercy to them also, as
He did by staying personally in Ayodhya to give audience to the people in general. One should not
mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhya because He especially
favored the citizens. The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each
individual person according to his capacity. One who abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee.

asikta-margam gandhodaih

asikta-margam--the streets were sprinkled; gandha-udaih--with perfumed water; karinam--of elephants;
mada-sikaraih--with particles of perfumed liquor; svaminam--the master or proprietor; praptam--present;
alokya--seeing personally; mattam--very opulent; va--either; sutaram--highly; iva--as if.
During the reign of Lord Ramacandra, the streets of the capital, Ayodhya, were sprinkled with perfumed
water and drops of perfumed liquor, thrown about by elephants from their trunks. When the citizens saw
the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the city in such opulence, they appreciated this opulence
very much.
We have simply heard about the opulence of Rama-rajya during the reign of Lord Ramacandra. Now,
here is one example of the opulence of the Lord's kingdom. The streets of Ayodhya were not only cleaned
but also sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which were distributed by
elephants through their trunks. There was no need of sprinkling machines, for the elephant has a natural
ability to suck water through its trunk and again throw it out in a shower. We can understand the
opulence of the city from this one example: it was actually sprinkled with perfumed water. Moreover, the
citizens had the opportunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the state. He was not a
sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His activities in sending His brothers to see to affairs
outside the capital and punish anyone who did not obey the emperor's orders. This is called dig-vijaya.
The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were also qualified with appropriate
attributes according to varnasrama. As we have seen from the previous chapter, varnasrama-gunanvitah:
the citizens were trained according to the varnasrama system. A class of men were brahmanas, a class of
men were ksatriyas, a class were vaisyas, and a class were sudras. Without this scientific division, there
can be no question of good citizenship. The King, being magnanimous and perfect in His duty, performed
many sacrifices and treated the citizens as His sons, and the citizens, being trained in the varnasrama
system, were obedient and perfectly ordered. The entire monarchy was so opulent and peaceful that the
government was even able to sprinkle the street with perfumed water, what to speak of other
management. Since the city was sprinkled with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it
was in other respects. Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign of Lord Ramacandra.

Chapter Twelve
The Dynasty of Kusa, the Son of Lord Ramacandra
This chapter describes the dynasty of Kusa, the son of Lord Ramacandra. The members of this dynasty
are descendants of Sasada, the son of Maharaja Iksvaku.
Following in the genealogical table of Lord Ramacandra's dynasty, Kusa, the Lord's son, was followed
consecutively by Atithi, Nisadha, Nabha, Pundarika, Ksemadhanva, Devanika, Aniha, Pariyatra,
Balasthala, Vajranabha, Sagana and Vidhrti. These personalities ruled the world. From Vidhrti came
Hiranyanabha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in
which Yajnavalkya was initiated. Following in this dynasty were Puspa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarsana,
Agnivarna, Sighra and Maru. Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the
village of Kalapa. At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god. Next in the
dynasty were Prasusruta, Sandhi, Amarsana, Mahasvan, Visvabahu, Prasenajit, Taksaka and Brhadbala,
who was later killed by Abhimanyu. Sukadeva Gosvami said that these were all kings who had passed
away. The future descendants of Brhadbala will be Brhadrana, Urukriya, Vatsavrddha, Prativyoma, Bhanu,
Divaka, Sahadeva, Brhadasva, Bhanuman, Pratikasva, Supratika, Marudeva, Sunaksatra, Puskara,
Antariksa, Sutapa, Amitrajit, Brhadraja, Barhi, Krtanjaya, Rananjaya, Sanjaya, Sakya, Suddhoda, Langala,
Prasenajit, Ksudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra. All of them will become kings one after another.
Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Iksvaku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will
be extinguished.

Having achieved perfection in the power of mystic yoga, Maru still lives in a place known as Kalapagrama.
At the end of Kali-yuga, he will revive the lost Surya dynasty by begetting a son.
At least five thousand years ago, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami ascertained the existence of Maru in Kalapagrama
and said that Maru, having achieved a yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of
Kali-yuga, which is calculated to continue for 432,000 years. Such is the perfection of mystic power. By
controlling the breath, the perfect yogi can continue his life for as long as he likes. Sometimes we hear
from the Vedic literature that some personalities from the Vedic age, such as Vyasadeva and Asvatthama,
are still living. Here we understand that Maru is also still living. We are sometimes surprised that a mortal
body can live for such a long time. The explanation of this longevity is given here by the word yogasiddha.
If one becomes perfect in the practice of yoga, he can live as long as he likes. The demonstration
of some trifling yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection. Here is a factual example of perfection: a yogasiddha
can live as long as he likes.

entitled "The Dynasty of Kusa, the Son of Lord Ramacandra."
Chapter Thirteen
The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi
This chapter describes the dynasty in which the great and learned scholar Janaka was born. This is the
dynasty of Maharaja Nimi, who is said to have been the son of Iksvaku.
When Maharaja Nimi began performing great sacrifices, he appointed Vasistha to be chief priest, but
Vasistha refused, for he had already agreed to be priest in performing a yajna for Lord Indra. Vasistha
therefore requested Maharaja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra's sacrifice was finished, but Maharaja Nimi
did not wait. He thought, "Life is very short, so there is no need to wait." He therefore appointed another
priest to perform the yajna. Vasistha was very angry at King Nimi and cursed him, saying, "May your
body fall down." Cursed in that way, Maharaja Nimi also became very angry, and he retaliated by saying,
"May your body also fall down." As a result of this cursing and countercursing, both of them died. After
this incident, Vasistha took birth again, begotten by Mitra and Varuna, who were agitated by Urvasi.
The priests who were engaged in the sacrifice for King Nimi preserved Nimi's body in fragrant
chemicals. When the sacrifice was over, the priests prayed for Nimi's life to all the demigods who had
come to the arena of yajna, but Maharaja Nimi refused to take birth again in a material body because he
considered the material body obnoxious. The great sages then churned Nimi's body, and as a result of this
churning, Janaka was born.
The son of Janaka was Udavasu, and the son of Udavasu was Nandivardhana. The son of Nandivardhana
was Suketu, and his descendants continued as follows: Devarata, Brhadratha, Mahavirya, Sudhrti,
Dhrstaketu, Haryasva, Maru, Pratipaka, Krtaratha, Devamidha, Visruta, Mahadhrti, Krtirata, Maharoma,
Svarnaroma, Hrasvaroma and Siradhvaja. All these sons appeared in the dynasty one after another. From
Siradhvaja, mother Sitadevi was born. Siradhvaja's son was Kusadhvaja, and the son of Kusadhvaja was
Dharmadhvaja. The sons of Dharmadhvaja were Krtadhvaja and Mitadhvaja. The son of Krtadhvaja was
Kesidhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was Khandikya. Kesidhvaja was a self-realized soul, and his son
was Bhanuman, whose descendants were as follows: Satadyumna, Suci, Sanadvaja, Urjaketu, Aja, Purujit,
Aristanemi, Srutayu, Suparsvaka, Citraratha, Ksemadhi, Samaratha, Satyaratha, Upaguru, Upagupta,
Vasvananta, Yuyudha, Subhasana, Sruta, Jaya, Vijaya, Rta, Sunaka, Vitahavya, Dhrti, Bahulasva, Krti and
Mahavasi. All of these sons were great self-controlled personalities. This completes the list of the entire
dynasty.

Maharaja Nimi, being a self-realized soul, considered that this life is flickering. Therefore, instead of
waiting long for Vasistha, he began performing the sacrifice with other priests.
Canakya Pandita says, sariram ksana-vidhvamsi kalpanta-sthayino gunah: "The duration of one's life in
the material world may end at any moment, but if within this life one does something worthy, that
qualification is depicted in history eternally." Here is a great personality, Maharaja Nimi, who knew this
fact. In the human form of life one should perform activities in such a way that at the end he goes back
home, back to Godhead. This is self-realization.

For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no offense, Maharaja Nimi countercursed his
spiritual master. "For the sake of getting contributions from the King of heaven," he said, "you have lost
your religious intelligence. Therefore I pronounce this curse: your body also will fall."
The religious principle for a brahmana is that he should not be greedy at all. In this case, however, for
the sake of more lucrative remunerations from the King of heaven, Vasistha neglected Maharaja Nimi's
request on this planet, and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests, Vasistha unnecessarily
cursed him. When one is infected by contaminated activities, his power, material or spiritual, reduces.
Although Vasistha was the spiritual master of Maharaja Nimi, because of his greed he became fallen.

and Varuna when they saw Urvasi, he was born again.
Mitra and Varuna chanced to meet Urvasi, the most beautiful prostitute of the heavenly kingdom, and
they became lusty. Because they were great saints, they tried to control their lust, but they could not do
so, and thus they discharged semen. This semen was kept carefully in a waterpot, and Vasistha was born
from it.

"If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so, kindly bring Maharaja Nimi
back to life in this body." The demigods said yes to this request by the sages, but Maharaja Nimi said,
"Please do not imprison me again in a material body."
The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human beings. Therefore, although the
great saints and sages were also powerful brahmanas, they requested the demigods to revive Maharaja
Nimi's body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms. One should not think that the
demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life
back to a dead body. There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature. For example, according to
the history of Savitri and Satyavan, Satyavan died and was being taken away by Yamaraja, but on the
request of his wife, Savitri, Satyavan was revived in the same body. This is an important fact about the
power of the demigods.

Maharaja Nimi continued: Mayavadis generally want freedom from accepting a material body because
they fear having to give it up again. But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the
Lord are unafraid. Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.
Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a cause of bondage; because he
was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he could render devotional service to the Lord. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings:
janmaobi more iccha yadi tora
bhakta-grhe jani janma ha-u mora
kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya dasa
"My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again, kindly do me this favor: allow
me to take birth in the home of Your servant, Your devotee. I do not mind being born there even as an
insignificant creature like an insect." Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagadisa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaitukyi tvayi
"O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or
fruitive activities described in flowery language. All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service
to You." (Siksastaka 4) By saying "life after life" (janmani janmani), the Lord referred not to an ordinary
birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a body is desirable. A devotee does
not think like yogis and jnanis, who want to refuse a material body and become one with the impersonal
Brahman effulgence. A devotee does not like this idea. On the contrary, he will accept any body, material
or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord. This is real liberation.
If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material body, there is no cause of
anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a liberated soul. This is confirmed by Srila Rupa
Gosvami:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krsna) with his body,
mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be
engaged in many so-called material activities." The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in
any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body. In a spiritual body the devotee
becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a
material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee
in Vaikunthaloka. There is no distinction. It is said, sadhur jivo va maro va. Whether a devotee is alive or
dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti. When he gives up
his body, he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same
thing even in a material body in the material world.
For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection. One may argue that at the time of death a
devotee also suffers because of giving up his material body. But in this connection the example may be
given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth. Both the mouse and the
kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten.
When a devotee gives up his body (tyaktva deham), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead. Thus
his perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by Yamaraja for punishment. A
person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a
material body, whereas a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much
afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one. Therefore, we should follow the
instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. It
doesn't matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should be to
serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all distress, lamentation and
fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in anxiety because
of fear of death.
The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is destined to die. In the lower
planetary system or lower species of life one may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one
may live for a long, long time, but death is inevitable. This fact should be understood. In the human form
of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing
tapasya. This is the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani. This can be done only when one is Krsna conscious, or has achieved the service
of the lotus feet of the Lord. Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material body
subject to birth, death, old age and disease.
The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the fish is never free from anxiety
about death, since big fish are always eager to eat the small fish. phalguni tatra mahatam: all living entities
are eaten by bigger living entities. This is the way of material nature.

"Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the
four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is
food for another." (Bhag. 1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material world in
such a way that one living entity is food for another. Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although
we speak of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord.
Harim vina naiva srtim taranti: one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming a
devotee. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.3). Aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani.
One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna must certainly wander up and down within the
cycle of birth and death.

deva ucuh
videha usyatam kamam
locanesu saririnam
unmesana-nimesabhyam
laksito 'dhyatma-samsthitah
devah ucuh--the demigods said; videhah--without any material body; usyatam--you live; kamam--as you
like; locanesu--in the vision; saririnam--of those who have material bodies; unmesana-nimesabhyam--
become manifest and unmanifest as you desire; laksitah--being seen; adhyatma-samsthitah--situated in a
spiritual body.
The demigods said: Let Maharaja Nimi live without a material body. Let him live in a spiritual body as a
personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, according to his desire, let him be
manifest or unmanifest to common materially embodied people.
The demigods wanted Maharaja Nimi to come to life, but Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept another
material body. Under the circumstances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave
him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body. There are two kinds of spiritual
bodies, as generally understood by common men. The term "spiritual body" is sometimes taken to refer to
a ghostly body. An impious man who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he
cannot possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind,
intelligence and ego. However, as explained in Bhagavad-gita, devotees can give up the material body and
attain a spiritual body free from all material tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti
mam eti so 'rjuna). Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he would be able to stay in a
purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle material contamination.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to His own transcendental desire;
similarly, a devotee, being jivan-mukta, can be seen or not, as he chooses. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
naham prakasah sarvasya yogamaya-samavrtah: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not
manifest to everyone and anyone. To the common man He is unseen. Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved
grahyam indriyaih: Krsna and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia cannot be materially
understood. Unless one is advanced in spiritual life (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau), one cannot see Krsna.
Therefore the ability to see Krsna depends on Krsna's mercy. The same privilege of being seen or unseen
according to one's own desire was given to Maharaja Nimi. Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as
an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Arajaka-bhayam. If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is danger of fear for the people.
At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people. Here we can see
that the great sages got a son from Nimi's material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance
is the duty of a ksatriya king. A ksatriya is one who saves the citizens from being injured. In the so-called
people's government there is no trained ksatriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he
becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned brahmanas expert in the sastras.
Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men
in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are
happy. The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy. People liked the government of Lord Ramacandra, the
government of Maharaja Yudhisthira and the governments of Maharaja Pariksit, Maharaja Ambarisa and
Maharaja Prahlada. There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch. Gradually the
democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are
trying to elect a dictator. A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader. Actually
people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the
government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures.

Personality of Godhead, Krsna; dvandvaih muktah--they were all freed from the duality of the material
world; grhesu api--even though staying at home.
Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King Pariksit, all the kings of the dynasty of Mithila were completely
in knowledge of their spiritual identity. Therefore, even though staying at home, they were liberated from
the duality of material existence.
This material world is called dvaita, or duality. The Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 4.176) says:
'dvaite 'bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba----'manodharma'
'ei bhala, ei manda,'----ei saba 'bhrama'
In the world of duality--that is to say, in the material world--so-called goodness and badness are both
the same. Therefore, in this world, to distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is
meaningless because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma). Because everything here is
miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply
illusion. The liberated person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature, is
unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances. He remains Krsna conscious by tolerating so-called
happiness and distress. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkhadah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed."
Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not
care about so-called happiness and distress. They know that these are like changing seasons, which are
perceivable by contact with the material body. Happiness and distress come and go. Therefore a pandita, a
learned man, is not concerned with them. As it is said, gatasun agatasums ca nanusocanti panditah. The
body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump of matter. It has no feelings of happiness and
distress. Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and
distress, but these come and go. It is understood herewith that the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila
were all liberated persons, unaffected by the so-called happiness and distress of this world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Maharaja Nimi."
Chapter Fourteen
King Pururava Enchanted by Urvasi
The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows. This chapter describes Soma and how he
kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha. Budha begot Pururava, who
begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvasi.
Lord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Brahma
had a son named Atri, and Atri's son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars. Soma became the
conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who was the wife of
Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods. A great fight ensued between the demigods and the
asuras, but Brahma rescued Brhaspati's wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband,
thus stopping the fighting. In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the
womb of Ila a son named Aila, or Pururava. Urvasi was captivated by Pururava's beauty, and therefore she
lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman. While
traveling all over the world, he met Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only
one night in a year.
One year later, Pururava saw Urvasi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when
he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief. Urvasi then advised Pururava to
worship the Gandharvas. Being satisfied with Pururava, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as
Agnisthali. Pururava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi, but while he was wandering in the forest his
misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company. After returning home and
meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire.
Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb
of a sami tree had come an asvattha tree. Pururava made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a
fire. By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires. The fire was considered the son of Pururava. In Satyayuga
there was only one social division, called hamsa; there were no divisions of varna like brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. The Veda was the omkara. The various demigods were not worshiped, for only
the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.

From Atri's tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who was full of soothing rays.
Lord Brahma appointed him the director of the brahmanas, drugs and luminaries.
According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (candrama manaso jatah). But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in
the eyes of Atri. This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of
the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium. When tears appear in the eyes
because of jubilation, the tears are soothing. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says, drgbhya
anandasrubhya ata evamrtamayah: "Here the word drgbhyah means 'from tears of jubilation.' Therefore
the moon-god is called amrtamayah, 'full of soothing rays.' " In the Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam
(4.1.15) we find this verse:

After conquering the three worlds [the upper, middle and lower planetary systems], Soma, the moongod,

forcibly kidnapped Brhaspati's wife, whose name was Tara.

Because of enmity between Brhaspati and Sukra, Sukra took the side of the moon-god and was joined by
the demons. But Lord Siva, because of affection for the son of his spiritual master, joined the side of
Brhaspati and was accompanied by all the ghosts and hobgoblins.
The moon-god is one of the demigods, but to fight against the other demigods he took the assistance of
the demons. Sukra, being an enemy of Brhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against
Brhaspati. To counteract this situation, Lord Siva, who was affectionate toward Brhaspati, joined
Brhaspati. The father of Brhaspati was Angira, from whom Lord Siva had received knowledge. Therefore
Lord Siva had some affection for Brhaspati and joined his side in this fight. Sridhara Svami remarks,
angirasah sakasat prapta-vidyo hara iti prasiddhah: "Lord Siva is well known to have received knowledge
from Angira."

impregnated by someone other than me. Immediately deliver your child! Immediately deliver it! Be
assured that after the child is delivered, I shall not burn you to ashes. I know that although you are

Tara was married to Brhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should have been impregnated by
him. But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was
unchaste. Although Brhaspati accepted Tara from Brahma, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted
her to deliver a son immediately. Tara certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might
be punished after giving birth. Thus Brhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she
was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son.

to him. Pierced by the arrow of Cupid, she thus approached him.

My dear King Pururava, please give protection to these two lambs, who have fallen down with me.
Although I belong to the heavenly planets and you belong to earth, I shall certainly enjoy sexual union
with you. I have no objection to accepting you as my husband, for you are superior in every respect.
As stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.40), yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesavasudhadi-
vibhuti-bhinnam. There are various planets and various atmospheres within this universe. The
atmosphere of the heavenly planet from which Urvasi descended after being cursed by Mitra and Varuna
was different from the atmosphere of this earth. Indeed, the inhabitants of the heavenly planets are
certainly far superior to the inhabitants of earth. Nonetheless, Urvasi agreed to remain the consort of
Pururava, although she belonged to a superior community. A woman who finds a man with superior
qualities may accept such a man as her husband. Similarly, if a man finds a woman who is from an
inferior family but who has good qualities, he can accept such a brilliant wife, as advised by Sri Canakya
Pandita (stri-ratnam duskulad api). The combination of male and female is worthwhile if the qualities of
both are on an equal level.

Indeed, you are attractive to all human society. Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from
the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.
It appears from the words of Urvasi that the standard of living, eating, behavior and speech are all
different on the heavenly planets from the standards on this planet earth. The inhabitants of the heavenly
planets do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared in clarified
butter. Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse. To
live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress
half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked. Indeed, there are many clubs and
societies for this purpose. Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets. The inhabitants
of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well
behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness. These are some of the distinctions
between the inhabitants of the heavenly planets and the inhabitants of earth.

therefore she left.

Urvasi said: My dear King, you are a man, a hero. Don't be impatient and give up your life. Be sober and
don't allow the senses to overcome you like foxes. Don't let the foxes eat you. In other words, you should
not be controlled by your senses. Rather, you should know that the heart of a woman is like that of a fox.
There is no use making friendship with women.
Canakya Pandita has advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: "Never place your faith in a
woman or a politician." Unless elevated to spiritual consciousness, everyone is conditioned and fallen,
what to speak of women, who are less intelligent than men. Women have been compared to sudras and
vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah). On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the
platform of Krsna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sudra or whatever, everyone is equal.
Otherwise, Urvasi, who was a woman herself and who knew the nature of women, said that a woman's
heart is like that of a sly fox. If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes. But
if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women. Canakya
Pandita has also advised that if one has a wife like a sly fox, he must immediately give up his life at home
and go to the forest.
mata yasya grhe nasti

Krsna conscious grhasthas must be very careful of the sly fox woman. If the wife at home is obedient
and follows her husband in Krsna consciousness, the home is welcome. Otherwise one should give up
one's home and go to the forest.

Women as a class are merciless and cunning. They cannot tolerate even a slight offense. For their own

brother.
King Pururava was greatly attached to Urvasi. Yet despite his faithfulness to her, she had left him. Now,
considering that the King was wasting his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvasi frankly explained the
nature of a woman. Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her
husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required. To say nothing of her husband, she can
even kill her brother. That is a woman's nature. Therefore, in the material world, unless women are
trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in society.

Women are very easily seduced by men. Therefore, polluted women give up the friendship of a man
who is their well-wisher and establish false friendship among fools. Indeed, they seek newer and newer
friends, one after another.
Because women are easily seduced, the Manu-samhita enjoins that they should not be given freedom. A
woman must always be protected, either by her father, by her husband, or by her elderly son. If women
are given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep their
propriety. The nature of a woman, as personally described by Urvasi, is to establish false friendship with
someone and then seek new male companions, one after another, even if this means giving up the
company of a sincere well-wisher.

Urvasi said: "My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be able to deliver me to you
again." In accordance with these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the
Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthali girl who looked exactly like Urvasi.
Thinking that the girl was Urvasi, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could
understand that she was not Urvasi but Agnisthali.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Pururava was very lusty. Immediately after getting the
Agnisthali girl, he wanted to have sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that
the girl was Agnisthali, not Urvasi. This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman knows
the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life. Thus Pururava understood during sexual
intercourse that the Agnisthali girl was not Urvasi.

King Pururava then left Agnisthali in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon
Urvasi. In the course of his meditation, the Treta millennium began, and therefore the principles of the
three Vedas, including the process of performing yajna to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his
heart.
It is said, tretayam yajato makhaih: in Treta-yuga, if one performed yajnas, he would get the results of
those yajnas. By performing visnu-yajna specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Of course, yajna is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
While Pururava was meditating upon Urvasi, the Treta-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajnas were
revealed in his heart. But Pururava was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses.
Yajnas for enjoyment of the senses are called karma-kandiya-yajnas. Therefore, he decided to perform
karma-kandiya-yajnas to fulfill his lusty desires. In other words, karma-kandiya-yajnas are meant for
sensuous persons, whereas yajna should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the sankirtana-yajna is
recommended. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah. Only those who are very intelligent take
to sankirtana-yajna to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense
enjoyment perform karma-kandiya-yajnas.

When the process of fruitive yajna became manifest within his heart, King Pururava went to the same
spot where he had left Agnisthali. There he saw that from the womb of a sami tree, an asvattha tree had
grown. He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two aranis. Desiring to go to the
planet where Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper
one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son. In this way he began to ignite a fire.
The Vedic fire for performing yajna was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices. Rather,
the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by
friction with a third. Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajna. If successful, a yajna will fulfill
the desire of its performer. Thus Pururava took advantage of the process of yajna to fulfill his lusty
desires. He thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son.
A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura is sami-garbhad agnim mantha.
A similar mantra is urvasyam urasi pururavah. Pururava wanted to have children continuously by the
womb of Urvasi. His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son. In other words,
he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajna he thought of Urvasi, instead of
thinking of the master of yajna, Yajnesvara, Lord Visnu.

kalpitah--it so became; tri-vrt--the three letters a-u-m combined together as om.
From Pururava's rubbing of the aranis came a fire. By such a fire one can achieve all success in material
enjoyment and be purified in seminal birth, initiation and in the performance of sacrifice, which are
invoked with the combined letters a-u-m. Thus the fire was considered the son of King Pururava.
According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (sukra), one can get a bona fide
disciple through initiation (savitra), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yajna).
Thus when Maharaja Pururava generated the fire by rubbing the aranis, the fire became his son. Either by
semen, by initiation or by yajna one may get a son. The Vedic mantra omkara, or pranava, consisting of
the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence. Therefore the words nirmanthanaj
jatah indicate that by the rubbing of the aranis a son was born.

bhagavantam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhoksajam--beyond the perception of the senses;
urvasi-lokam--to the planet where Urvasi was staying; anvicchan--although desiring to go; sarva-devamayam--
the reservoir of all demigods; harim--the Supreme personality of Godhead.
By means of that fire, Pururava, who desired to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, performed a
sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of
sacrifice. Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of
all the demigods.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: any loka, or planet, to
which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the
performance of sacrifice. The purpose of yajna is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this
age, as we have explained many times, the yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only
sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material
or spiritual. Bhagavad-gita (3.14) also says, yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by offering sacrifices to Lord Visnu,
one can have sufficient rainfall. When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce
everything (sama-kama-dugha mahi). If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of
life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables. Everything one gets for material
wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, sarva-kama-dugha mahi (Bhag. 1.10.4).
Everything is possible by performing yajna. Therefore although Pururava desired something material, he
factually performed yajna to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is adhoksaja, beyond
the perception of Pururava and everyone else. Consequently, some kind of yajna must be performed to
fulfill the desires of the living entity. Yajnas can be performed in human society only when society is
divided by varnasrama-dharma into four varnas and four asramas. Without such a regulative process, no
one can perform yajnas, and without the performance of yajnas, no material plans can make human
society happy at any time. Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajnas. In this age of Kali, the
yajna recommended is sankirtana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.
This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.

Narayana (was worshipable in the Satya-yuga); na anyah--no other; ekah agnih--one division only for
agni; varnah--order of life; eva ca--and certainly.
In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra--pranava, the
root of all Vedic mantras. In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana was the only worshipable Deity; there was no
recommendation for worship of the demigods. Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human
society was known as hamsa.
In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four. Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda,
the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the Yajur Veda), was divided into four--Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva--for
the facility of human society. In Satya-yuga the only mantra was omkara (om tat sat). The same name
omkara is manifest in the mantra Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Unless one is a brahmana, one cannot utter omkara and get the desired
result. But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a sudra, unfit for pronouncing the pranava, omkara. Therefore
the sastras have recommended the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Omkara is a mantra, or
maha-mantra, and Hare Krsna is also a maha-mantra. The purpose of pronouncing omkara is to address
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya). And the purpose of
chanting the Hare Krsna mantra is the same. Hare: "O energy of the Lord!" Krsna: "O Lord Krsna!" Hare:
"O energy of the Lord!" Rama: "O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer!" The only worshipable Lord is
Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). By worshiping the demigods, one
worships the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree. But
worshiping Narayana, the all-inclusive Supreme personality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root
of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on. In Satya-yuga people
knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worshiping Narayana, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The same purpose can be served in this age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, as
recommended in the Bhagavatam. Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet. Simply by chanting
the Hare Krsna mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes
eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

Therefore this verse says, trayi treta-mukhe. Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that in Treta-yuga, beginning in the Svayambhuva-manvantara,
ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Pururava Enchanted by Urvasi."
Chapter Fifteen
Parasurama, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation
This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.
From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu, Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya. The son
of Srutayu was Vasuman, the son of Satyayu was Srutanjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was
Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima. Bhima's son was named Kancana, the son of Kancana was
Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the
Ganges in one sip. The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balaka, Ajaka and Kusa. The
sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kusanabha. From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a
daughter named Satyavati. Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry,
and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni, Jamadagni was born. The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or
Parasurama. When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni's desire cow, Parasurama, who is
ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
killed Kartaviryarjuna. Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times. After Parasurama
killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should
have tolerated the offense. Therefore Jamadagni advised Parasurama to atone for his sin by traveling to
various holy places.

King Gadhi had a daughter named Satyavati, whom a brahmana sage named Rcika requested from the
King to be his wife. King Gadhi, however, regarded Rcika as an unfit husband for his daughter, and
therefore he told the brahmana, "My dear sir, I belong to the dynasty of Kusa. Because we are aristocratic
ksatriyas, you have to give some dowry for my daughter. Therefore, bring at least one thousand horses,
each as brilliant as moonshine and each having one black ear, whether right or left."
The son of King Gadhi was Visvamitra, who was said to be a brahmana and ksatriya combined.
Visvamitra attained the status of a brahmarsi, as explained later. From the marriage of Satyavati with
Rcika Muni would come a son with the spirit of a ksatriya. King Gadhi demanded that an uncommon
request be fulfilled before the brahmana Rcika could marry his daughter.

Thereafter, Rcika Muni's wife and mother-in-law, each desiring a son, requested the Muni to prepare an

mother-in-law with a ksatriya mantra. Then he went out to bathe.

her mother and ate her mother's oblation herself.
A husband naturally has some affection for his wife. Therefore Satyavati's mother thought that the
oblation prepared for Satyavati by the sage Rcika must have been better than her own oblation. In Rcika's
absence, the mother took the better oblation from Satyavati and ate it.

tat--this fact; viditva--having learned; munih--the great sage; praha--said; patnim--unto his wife;
kastam--very regrettable; akarasih--you have done; ghorah--fierce; danda-dharah--a great personality who
can punish others; putrah--such a son; bhrata--brother; te--your; brahma-vittamah--a learned scholar in
spiritual science.
When the great sage Rcika returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his
absence, he said to his wife, Satyavati, "You have done a great wrong. Your son will be a fierce ksatriya,
able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science."
A brahmana is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar
in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving. A ksatriya, however, is highly qualified when he
is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers. These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.42-43).
Because Satyavati, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she
would give birth to a son imbued with the ksatriya spirit. This was undesirable. The son of a brahmana is
generally expected to become a brahmana, but if such a son becomes fierce like a ksatriya, he is
designated according to the description of the four varnas in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam
guna-karma-vibhagasah). If the son of a brahmana does not become like a brahmana, he may be called a
ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, according to his qualifications. The basic principle for dividing society is not a
person's birth but his qualities and actions.

Satyavati, however, pacified Rcika Muni with peaceful words and requested that her son not be like a

born as the son of Satyavati.
The great sage Rcika was very angry, but somehow or other Satyavati pacified him, and at her request he
changed his mind. It is indicated here that the son of Jamadagni would be born as Parasurama.

drptam ksatram bhuvo bharam
abrahmanyam aninasat
rajas-tamo-vrtam ahan
phalguny api krte 'mhasi
drptam--very proud; ksatram--the ksatriyas, the ruling class; bhuvah--of the earth; bharam--burden;
abrahmanyam--sinful, not caring for the religious principles enunciated by the brahmanas; aninasat--
drove away or annihilated; rajah-tamah--by the qualities of passion and ignorance; vrtam--covered; ahan--
he killed; phalguni--not very great; api--although; krte--had been committed; amhasi--an offense.
When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and
ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brahmanas, Parasurama killed
them. Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.
The ksatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations
enacted by great brahmanas and saintly persons. As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in
regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth. As stated here, rajas-tamo-vrtam,
bharam abrahmanyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely
ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power.
We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but
unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourthclass
men. Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished
in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former
monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the
mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded. When the government is actually
guided by brahmanas, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people. Therefore
in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the
brahmanas, headed by such a ksatriya-spirited brahmana as Parasurama, killed them twenty-one
consecutive times.
In Kali-yuga, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-prayesu rajasu: the ruling class (rajanya)
will be no better than plunderers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize
the affairs of the government. Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations,
they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration. As stated elsewhere in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40):
asamskrtah kriya-hina
rajasa tamasavrtah
prajas te bhaksayisyanti
mleccha rajanya-rupinah
Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of
passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government
(rajanya-rupinah), will swallow the citizens (prajas te bhaksayisyanti). And in still another place, Srimad-
Bhagavatam (12.2.7-8) says:
evam prajabhir dustabhir
akirne ksiti-mandale
brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam
yo bali bhavita nrpah
praja hi lubdhai rajanyair
nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih
acchinna-dara-dravina
yasyanti giri-kananam
Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya
srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society
are not considered, the result will be brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam yo bali bhavita nrpah: the so-called
caste system of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra will be meaningless. As a result, whoever somehow
or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the prajas, or citizens, will be so
harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yasyanti giri-kananam) to
escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of
plunderers. Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must take to the Krsna consciousness
movement, the Hare Krsna movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now
appeared as an incarnation by His holy name. Therefore, when the prajas become Krsna conscious, they
can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of
material existence.

arhanam--paraphernalia for worship; aharat--offered; sa-sainya--with his soldiers; amatya--his ministers;

because of possessing a kamadhenu, a cow that could supply everything; tapah-dhanah--the great sage,
whose only power was his austerity, or who was engaged in austerity.
The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the forest, received the King very well,
along with the King's soldiers, ministers and carriers. He supplied all the necessities to worship these
guests, for he possessed a kamadhenu cow that was able to supply everything.
The Brahma-samhita informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vrndavana,
where Krsna lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam). The surabhi cow is also called
kamadhenu. Although Jamadagni possessed only one kamadhenu, he was able to get from it everything
desirable. Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King's great number of followers,
ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers. When we speak of a king, we understand that he is
accompanied by many followers. Jamadagni was able to receive all the King's followers properly and feed
them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee. The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was
because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage. This was the
beginning of his offense. Parasurama, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed
Kartaviryarjuna because Kartaviryarjuna was too proud. One may possess unusual opulence in this
material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Parasurama became angry
at Kartaviryarjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.

sah--he (Kartaviryarjuna); vai--indeed; ratnam--a great source of wealth; tu--indeed; tat--the kamadhenu
in the possession of Jamadagni; drstva--by observing; atma-aisvarya--his own personal opulence; atisayanam--
which was exceeding; tat--that; na--not; adriyata--appreciated very much; agnihotryam--in that
cow, which was useful for executing the agnihotra sacrifice; sa-abhilasah--became desirous; sa-haihayah--
with his own men, the Haihayas.
Kartaviryarjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy than himself because of
possessing a jewel in the form of the kamadhenu. Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not
very much appreciative of Jamadagni's reception. On the contrary, they wanted to possess that
kamadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.
Jamadagni was more powerful than Kartaviryarjuna because of performing the agnihotra-yajna with
clarified butter received from the kamadhenu. Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow.
Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient
milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and clarified ghee, especially for performing the
agnihotra-yajna. This is possible for everyone. Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advises goraksya,
the protection of cows. This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely
supply sufficient milk. We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are
giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk. In other farms the cows do
not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill
them, they are happy, and they give ample milk. Therefore this instruction given by Lord Krsna--goraksya--
is extremely meaningful. The whole world must learn from Krsna how to live happily without
scarcity simply by producing food grains (annad bhavanti bhutani) and giving protection to the cows (goraksya).
Krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam. Those who belong to the third level of
human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving
protection to cows. This is the injunction of Bhagavad-gita. In the matter of protecting the cows, the meateaters
will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Krsna gives stress to cow protection,
those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and
sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement
of human society.

havih-dhanim--the kamadhenu; rseh--of the great sage Jamadagni; darpat--because of his being puffed
up with material power; naran--all his men (soldiers); hartum--to steal or take away; acodayat--
encouraged; te--the men of Kartaviryarjuna; ca--also; mahismatim--to the capital of Kartaviryarjuna;
ninyuh--brought; sa-vatsam--with the calf; krandatim--crying; balat--because of being taken away by
force.
Being puffed up by material power, Kartaviryarjuna encouraged his men to steal Jamadagni's
kamadhenu. Thus the men forcibly took away the crying kamadhenu, along with her calf, to Mahismati,
Kartaviryarjuna's capital.
The word havirdhanim is significant in this verse. Havirdhanim refers to a cow required for supplying
havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices. In human life, one should be
trained to perform yajnas. As we are informed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko
'yam karma-bandhanah: if we do not perform yajna, we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification
like dogs and hogs. This is not civilization. A human being should be trained to perform yajna. Yajnad
bhavati parjanyah. If yajnas are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when
there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life. Yajna,
therefore, is essential. For performing yajna, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow
protection is essential. Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer. Socalled
scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the
hands of prakrti, nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah). Nonetheless, although they are
forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti
manyate). The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in
which everyone will be happy. This is the motive of our Krsna consciousness movement. Yajne sukhena
bhavantu.

Upon seeing Parasurama, Kartaviryarjuna immediately feared him and sent many elephants, chariots,
horses and infantry soldiers equipped with clubs, swords, arrows, rstis, sataghnis, saktis, and many similar
weapons to fight against him. Kartaviryarjuna sent seventeen full aksauhinis of soldiers to check
Parasurama. But Lord Parasurama alone killed all of them.
The word aksauhini refers to a military phalanx consisting of 21,870 chariots and elephants, 109,350
infantry soldiers and 65,610 horses. An exact description is given in the Mahabharata, Adi parva, Second
Chapter, as follows:

"One chariot, one elephant, five infantry soldiers and three horses are called a patti by those who are
learned in the science. The wise also know that a senamukha is three times what a patti is. Three
senamukhas are known as one gulma, three gulmas are called a gana, and three ganas are called a vahini.
Three vahinis have been referred to by the learned as a prtana, three prtanas equal one camu, and three
camus equal one anikini. The wise refer to ten anikinis as one aksauhini. The chariots of an aksauhini
have been calculated at 21,870 by those who know the science of such calculations, O best of the twiceborn,
and the number of elephants is the same. The number of infantry soldiers is 109,350, and the

Different personalities become beautiful by possessing different qualities. Canakya Pandita says that the
cuckoo bird, although very black, is beautiful because of its sweet voice. Similarly, a woman becomes
beautiful by her chastity and faithfulness to her husband, and an ugly person becomes beautiful when he
becomes a learned scholar. In the same way, brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras become beautiful by
their qualities. Brahmanas are beautiful when they are forgiving, ksatriyas when they are heroic and never
retreat from fighting, vaisyas when they enrich cultural activities and protect cows, and sudras when they
are faithful in the discharge of duties pleasing to their masters. Thus everyone becomes beautiful by his
special qualities. And the special quality of the brahmana, as described here, is forgiveness.

My dear son, killing a king who is an emperor is more severely sinful than killing a brahmana. But now,
if you become Krsna conscious and worship the holy places, you can atone for this great sin.
One who fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is freed from all sins (aham tvam
sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami). From the very day or moment he fully surrenders to Sri Krsna, even the
most sinful person is freed. Nonetheless, as an example, Jamadagni advised his son Parasurama to worship
the holy places. Because an ordinary person cannot immediately surrender to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he is advised to go from one holy place to another to find saintly persons and thus gradually be
released from sinful reactions.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Parasurama, the Lord's Warrior Incarnation."
Chapter Sixteen
Lord Parasurama Destroys the World's Ruling Class
When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described in this chapter, Parasurama rid
the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times. This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.
When Jamadagni's wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the
Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate
with him. Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband. Parasurama killed his mother
and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived. The sons of
Kartaviryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord
Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was
meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Parasurama returned to the asrama and saw his
father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out
with determination to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world. Taking up his axe, he went to
Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and killed all of Kartaviryarjuna's sons, whose blood
became a great river. Parasurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kartaviryarjuna;
later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no
ksatriyas on the surface of the earth. Thereafter, Parasurama joined the head of his father to the dead body
and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord. Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body,
and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarsi-mandala. Parasurama, the
son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata. In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of
Vedic knowledge.
In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Visvamitra took birth. By dint of his austerity and penance,
he became a brahmana. He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas. In the sacrificial
arena of Hariscandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy
of the Prajapatis he was released. Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi. The fifty elder
sons of Visvamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder brother, and therefore Visvamitra
cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization. Visvamitra's fifty-first son, along
with his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Visvamitra,
being satisfied, blessed them. Thus Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently
there are different divisions of that dynasty.

The word prabhava jnah is significant. Parasurama knew the prowess of his father, and therefore he
agreed to carry out his father's order. He thought that if he refused to carry out the order he would be
cursed, but if he carried it out his father would be pleased, and when his father was pleased, Parasurama
would ask the benediction of having his mother and brothers brought back to life. Parasurama was
confident in this regard, and therefore he agreed to kill his mother and brothers.

My dear King Pariksit, the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, who were defeated by the superior strength of

Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but because of a slight offense by his poor
wife, Renuka, he ordered that she be killed. This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was
killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described herein. Lord Parasurama was also infected by sin
because of killing Kartaviryarjuna, although this was not very offensive. Therefore, whether one be
Kartaviryarjuna, Lord Parasurama, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and

With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Parasurama created a ghastly river, which brought
great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture. Because the ksatriyas, the men of
power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Parasurama, on the plea of retaliating for the
murder of his father, rid all the ksatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times. Indeed, in the place
known as Samanta-pancaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.
Parasurama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal mission is paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam--to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants. To kill all the sinful men is
one among the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead. Lord Parasurama killed all the ksatriyas twenty-one
times consecutively because they were disobedient to the brahminical culture. That the ksatriyas had
killed his father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the ksatriyas, the ruling class, had become
polluted, their position was inauspicious. Brahminical culture is enjoined in the sastra, especially in
Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah). According to the laws of nature,
whether at the time of Parasurama or at the present, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful,
not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like Parasurama to create
a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some other calamity. Whenever the government disrespects the
supremacy of the personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of varnasrama-dharma, it will
certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Parasurama.

Thereafter, having completed the ritualistic sacrificial ceremonies, Lord Parasurama took the bath
known as the avabhrtha-snana. Standing on the bank of the great river Sarasvati, cleared of all sins, Lord
Parasurama appeared like the sun in a clear, cloudless sky.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: "Work done
as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." Karmabandhanah
refers to the repeated acceptance of one material body after another. The whole problem of life
is this repetition of birth and death. Therefore one is advised to work to perform yajna meant for
satisfying Lord Visnu. Although Lord Parasurama was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities. Anyone in this material world, however careful he may
be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not want to. For example, one may trample
many small ants and other insects while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly.
Therefore the Vedic principle of panca-yajna, five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is compulsory. In this
age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to people in general. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah: we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Krsna. Krsna-varnam
tvisakrsnam: although He is Krsna Himself, He always chants Hare Krsna and preaches Krsna
consciousness. One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the sankirtana-yajna. The
performance of sankirtana-yajna is a special concession for human society to save people from being
affected by known or unknown sinful activities. We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is
compulsory that one take to Krsna consciousness and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.

Visvamitra, the son of Maharaja Gadhi, was as powerful as the flames of fire. From the position of a
ksatriya, he achieved the position of a powerful brahmana by undergoing penances and austerities.
Now, having narrated the history of Lord Parasurama, Sukadeva Gosvami begins the history of
Visvamitra. From the history of Parasurama we can understand that although Parasurama belonged to the
brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a ksatriya. Later, after finishing his work as a
ksatriya, he again became a brahmana and returned to Mahendra-parvata. Similarly, we can see that
although Visvamitra was born in a ksatriya family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of
a brahmana. These histories confirm the statements in sastra that a brahmana may become a ksatriya, a
ksatriya may become a brahmana or vaisya, and a vaisya may become a brahmana, by achieving the
required qualities. One's status does not depend upon birth. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(7.11.35) by Narada:
yasya yal laksanam proktam
pumso varnabhivyanjakam
yad anyatrapi drsyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiset
"If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, even if he has appeared in a
different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification." To know who is a
brahmana and who is a ksatriya, one must consider a man's quality and work. If all the unqualified sudras
become so-called brahmanas and ksatriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain. Thus there will be
discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will
be hellish.

Sunahsepha's father sold Sunahsepha to be sacrificed as a man-animal in the yajna of King Hariscandra.
When Sunahsepha was brought into the sacrificial arena, he prayed to the demigods for release and was
released by their mercy.
Here is a description of Sunahsepha. When Hariscandra was to sacrifice his son Rohita, Rohita arranged
to save his own life by purchasing Sunahsepha from Sunahsepha's father to be sacrificed in the yajna.
Sunahsepha was sold to Maharaja Hariscandra because he was the middle son, between the oldest and the
youngest. It appears that the sacrifice of a man as an animal in yajna has been practiced for a very long
time.

When requested by their father to accept Sunahsepha as the eldest son, the elder fifty of the
Madhucchandas, the sons of Visvamitra, did not agree. Therefore Visvamitra, being angry, cursed them.
"May all of you bad sons become mlecchas," he said, "being opposed to the principles of Vedic culture."
In Vedic literature there are names like mleccha and yavana. The mlecchas are understood to be those
who do not follow the Vedic principles. In former days, the mlecchas were fewer, and Visvamitra Muni
cursed his sons to become mlecchas. But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for
people are automatically mlecchas. This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the
entire population will consist of mlecchas because no one will follow the Vedic principles. At that time
the incarnation Kalki will appear. Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi kara-balam. He will kill all the
mlecchas indiscriminately with his sword.

Thus the younger Madhucchandas accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother and told him, "We shall

and therefore I bless all of you to become the fathers of sons also."
Of the one hundred sons, half disobeyed Visvamitra by not accepting Sunahsepha as their eldest
brother, but the other half accepted his order. Therefore the father blessed the obedient sons to become
the fathers of sons. Otherwise they too would have been cursed to be sonless mlecchas.

Chapter Seventeen
The Dynasties of the Sons of Pururava
Ayu, the eldest son of Pururava, had five sons. This chapter describes the dynasties of four of them,
beginning with Ksatravrddha.
Ayu, the son of Pururava, had five sons-- Nahusa, Ksatravrddha, Raji, Rabha and Anena. The son of
Ksatravrddha was Suhotra, who had three sons, named Kasya, Kusa and Grtsamada. The son of
Grtsamada was Sunaka, and his son was Saunaka. The son of Kasya was Kasi. From Kasi came the sons
and grandsons known as Rastra, Dirghatama and then Dhanvantari, who was the inaugurator of medical
science and was a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. The
descendants of Dhanvantari were Ketuman, Bhimaratha, Divodasa and Dyuman, who was also known as
Pratardana, Satrujit, Vatsa, Rtadhvaja and Kuvalayasva. The son of Dyuman was Alarka, who reigned over
the kingdom for many, many years. Following in the dynasty of Alarka were Santati, Sunitha, Niketana,
Dharmaketu, Satyaketu, Dhrstaketu, Sukumara, Vitihotra, Bharga and Bhargabhumi. All of them belonged
to the dynasty of Kasi, the descendant of Ksatravrddha.
The son of Rabha was Rabhasa, and his son was Gambhira. Gambhira's son was Akriya, and from Akriya
came Brahmavit. The son of Anena was Suddha, and his son was Suci. The son of Suci was Citrakrt,
whose son was Santaraja. Raji had five hundred sons, all of extraordinary strength. Raji was personally
very powerful and was given the kingdom of heaven by Lord Indra. Later, after Raji's death, when the
sons of Raji refused to return the kingdom to Indra, by Brhaspati's arrangement they became
unintelligent, and Lord Indra conquered them.
The grandson of Ksatravrddha named Kusa gave birth to a son named Prati. From Prati came Sanjaya;
from Sanjaya, Jaya; from Jaya, Krta; and from Krta, Haryabala. The son of Haryabala was Sahadeva; the
son of Sahadeva, Hina; the son of Hina, Jayasena; the son of Jayasena, Sankrti; and the son of Sankrti, Jaya.

Upon Raji's death, Indra begged Raji's sons for the return of the heavenly planet. They did not return it,
however, although they agreed to return Indra's shares in ritualistic ceremonies.
Raji conquered the kingdom of heaven, and therefore when Indra, the heavenly king, begged Raji's sons
to return it, they refused. Because they had not taken the heavenly kingdom from Indra but had inherited
it from their father, they considered it their paternal property. Why then should they return it to the
demigods?

Bhagavatam, entitled "The Dynasties of the Sons of Pururava."
Chapter Eighteen
King Yayati Regains His Youth
This chapter gives the history of King Yayati, the son of Nahusa. Among Yayati's five sons, the youngest
son, Puru, accepted Yayati's invalidity.
When Nahusa, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, Yati, took sannyasa,
and therefore the next son, Yayati, was enthroned as king. By providence, Yayati married the daughter of
Sukracarya. Sukracarya was a brahmana and Yayati a ksatriya, but Yayati married her nonetheless.
Sukracarya's daughter, named Devayani, had a girl friend named Sarmistha, who was the daughter of
Vrsaparva. King Yayati married Sarmistha also. The history of this marriage is as follows. Once Sarmistha
was sporting in the water with thousands of her girl friends, and Devayani was also there. When the
young girls saw Lord Siva, seated on his bull with Uma, they immediately dressed themselves, but
Sarmistha mistakenly put on Devayani's clothes. Devayani, being very angry, rebuked Sarmistha, who also
became very angry and responded by rebuking Devayani and throwing her into a well. By chance, King
Yayati came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayani and rescued her. Thus Devayani accepted
Maharaja Yayati as her husband. Thereafter, Devayani, crying loudly, told her father about Sarmistha's
behavior. Upon hearing of this incident, Sukracarya was very angry and wanted to chastise Vrsaparva,
Sarmistha's father. Vrsaparva, however, satisfied Sukracarya by offering Sarmistha as Devayani's
maidservant. Thus Sarmistha, as the maidservant of Devayani, also went to the house of Devayani's
husband. When Sarmistha found her friend Devayani with a son she also desired to have a son. Therefore,
at the proper time for conception, she also requested Maharaja Yayati for sex. When Sarmistha became
pregnant also, Devayani was very envious. In great anger, she immediately left for her father's house and
told her father everything. Sukracarya again became angry and cursed Maharaja Yayati to become old, but
when Yayati begged Sukracarya to be merciful to him, Sukracarya gave him the benediction that he could
transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man. Yayati exchanged his old age for the youth of his
youngest son, Puru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.

pravistah--having entered; purusah--such a person; atmanam--self-realization; na--not; avabudhyate--will

When one enters the post of king or head of the government, one cannot understand the meaning of
self-realization. Knowing this, Yati, the eldest son of Nahusa, did not accept the power to rule, although it
was offered by his father.
Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who
are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities. Ksatriyas are generally
endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification,
but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence. Indeed, they accept only
the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization. It is specifically mentioned here
that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one looses the chance for human perfection.
Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears Srimad-Bhagavatam. This hearing is
described as nityam bhagavata-sevaya. Maharaja Pariksit was involved in politics, but because at the end
of his life he heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from Sukadeva Gosvami, he attained perfection very easily. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore suggested:
sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir
ye prayaso 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyam
(Bhag. 10.14.3)
Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears
Srimad-Bhagavatam from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.

Therefore I am curious to know how there occurred this pratiloma marriage between a ksatriya and a
brahmana.
According to the Vedic system, marriages between ksatriyas and ksatriyas or between brahmanas and
brahmanas are the general custom. If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these
marriages are of two types, namely anuloma and pratiloma. Anuloma, marriage between a brahmana and
the daughter of a ksatriya, is permissible, but pratiloma, marriage between a ksatriya and the daughter of a
brahmana, is not generally allowed. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was curious about how Sukracarya, a
powerful brahmana, could accept the principle of pratiloma. Maharaja Pariksit was eager to know the
cause for this uncommon marriage.

Sarmistha was heavily rebuked by Devayani she charged Devayani with belonging to a family of crowlike
beggars. It is the nature of women to fight verbally at even a slight provocation. As we see from this

conqueror of the cities of your enemies, by accepting my hand you have accepted me as your married
wife. Let me not be touched by others, for our relationship as husband and wife has been made possible
by providence, not by any human being.
While taking Devayani out of the well, King Yayati must certainly have appreciated her youthful beauty,
and therefore he might have asked her which caste she belonged to. Thus Devayani would have
immediately replied, "We are already married because you have accepted my hand." Uniting the hands of
the bride and bridegroom is a system perpetually existing in all societies. Therefore, as soon as Yayati
accepted Devayani's hand, they could be regarded as married. Because Devayani was enamored with the
hero Yayati, she requested him not to change his mind and let another come to marry her.

Because of falling in the well, I met you. Indeed, this has been arranged by providence. After I cursed
Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Brhaspati, he cursed me by saying that I would not have a brahmana
for a husband. Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife of a
brahmana.
Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Brhaspati, had been a student of Sukracarya, from whom he
had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely. This art, called mrta-sanjivani, was
especially used during wartime. When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a
soldier's body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of mrta-sanjivani. This art was
known to Sukracarya and many others, and Kaca, the son of Brhaspati, became Sukracarya's student to
learn it. Devayani desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Sukracarya, looked
upon the guru's daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her. Devayani angrily
cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of mrta-sanjivani from her father, it would be
useless. When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayani never to have a husband who was a
brahmana. Because Devayani liked Yayati, who was a ksatriya, she requested him to accept her as his bona
fide wife. Although this would be pratiloma-vivaha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and
the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence.

Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Because such a marriage is not sanctioned by regular scriptures, King
Yayati did not like it, but because it was arranged by providence and because he was attracted by
Devayani's beauty, he accepted her request.
According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes of the boy and girl who were
to be married. If according to astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect,
the match was called yotaka and the marriage would be accepted. Even fifty years ago, this system was
current in Hindu society. Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl, without
this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place. A person is born in one of three
categories, known as deva-gana, manusya-gana and raksasa-gana. In different parts of the universe there
are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people resemble demigods whereas others
resemble demons. If according to astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a
demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place. Similarly, there were calculations of pratiloma and
anuloma. The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy,
whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness. Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find
many divorces. Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly one's marriage
would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great that the wife would
voluntarily die when her husband died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life. Now,
of course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal society. Marriage
now takes place simply by agreement. Dampatye 'bhirucir hetuh (Bhag. 12.2.3). The word abhiruci means
"agreement." If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place. But when the Vedic
system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce.

As Sukracarya listened to what had happened to Devayani, his mind was very much aggrieved.
Condemning the profession of priesthood and praising the profession of uncha-vrtti [collecting grains
from the fields], he left home with his daughter.
When a brahmana adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the
field. This is called uncha-vrtti. A brahmana who takes to this uncha-vrtti profession is called first class
because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg
from anyone. Although the profession of begging is allowed for a brahmana or sannyasi, one does better if
he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead for maintenance. Sukracarya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter's complaint he
had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the
profession of priesthood. In his heart, Sukracarya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it,
he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.

Sometimes a great personality like Sukracarya cannot neglect sons and daughters, for sons and
daughters are by nature dependent on their father and the father has affection for them. Although
Sukracarya knew that the quarrel between Devayani and Sarmistha was childish, as Devayani's father he
had to side with his daughter. He did not like to do this, but he was obliged to because of affection. He
plainly admitted that although he should not have asked the King for mercy for his daughter, because of
affection he could not avoid doing so.

Vrsaparva wisely thought that Sukracarya's displeasure would bring danger and that his pleasure would
bring material gain. Therefore he carried out Sukracarya's order and served him like a slave. He gave his
daughter Sarmistha to Devayani, and Sarmistha served Devayani like a slave, along with thousands of
other women.
In the beginning of these affairs concerning Sarmistha and Devayani, we saw that Sarmistha had many
friends. Now these friends became maidservants of Devayani. When a girl married a ksatriya king, it was
customary for all her girl friends to go with her to her husband's house. For instance, when Vasudeva
married Devaki, the mother of Krsna, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who
accompanied her. A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of
his wife. Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children. Such children
were accepted as dasi-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them. The female
population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king
would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen. In the history of
Krsna's household life we find that Krsna married 16,108 wives. These were not maidservants but direct
queens, and Krsna expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and
every wife. This is not possible for ordinary men. Therefore although the kings had to maintain many,
many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments.

When Princess Sarmistha begged King Yayati for a son, the King was certainly aware of the principles of
religion, and therefore he agreed to fulfill her desire. Although he remembered the warning of Sukracarya,
he thought of this union as the desire of the Supreme, and thus he had sex with Sarmistha.
King Yayati was completely aware of the duty of a ksatriya. When a ksatriya is approached by a woman,
he cannot deny her. This is a religious principle. Consequently, when Dharmaraja, Yudhisthira, saw
Arjuna unhappy after Arjuna returned from Dvaraka, he asked whether Arjuna had refused a woman who
had begged for a son. Although Maharaja Yayati remembered Sukracarya's warning, he could not refuse
Sarmistha. He thought it wise to give her a son, and thus he had sexual intercourse with her after her
menstrual period. This kind of lust is not against religious principles. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11),
dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo 'smi: sex life not contrary to the principles of religion is sanctioned by
Krsna. Because Sarmistha, the daughter of a king, had begged Yayati for a son, their combination was not
lust but an act of religion.

My dear son, I am not yet satisfied in my sexual desires. But if you are kind to me, you can take the old
age given by your maternal grandfather, and I may take your youth so that I may enjoy life for a few years
more.
This is the nature of lusty desires. In Bhagavad-gita (7.20) it is said, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah: when
one is too attached to sense gratification, he actually loses his sense. The word hrta jnanah refers to one
who has lost his sense. Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his son to exchange youth for old
age. Of course, the entire world is under such illusion. Therefore it is said that everyone is pramattah, or
exclusively mad. Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: when one becomes almost like a madman, he
indulges in sex and sense gratification. Sex and sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one
achieves perfection when he has no desires for sex. This is possible only when one is fully Krsna
conscious.

"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in
Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." Sexual desire
can be stopped only when one is fully Krsna conscious, and not otherwise. As long as one has desires for
sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different
species or forms. But although the forms may differ, the business of sex is the same. Therefore it is said,
punah punas carvita-carvananam. Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body
to another, with the same business of "chewing the chewed," tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex
enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod, and so on.

Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age, although you also were a young man.
But I do not welcome your old age and invalidity, for unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot
attain renunciation.
Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life. Therefore the varnasrama
institution is most scientific. It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one
cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu said, niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants to go back home, back to
Godhead, must be niskincana, free from all affinity for material enjoyment. Brahmany upasamasrayam:
unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman. Devotional
service is rendered on the Brahman platform. Therefore, unless one attains the Brahman platform, or
spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in
devotional service is already on the Brahman platform.
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." (Bg. 14.26) If one
attains devotional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated. Generally, unless one enjoys material
happiness, one cannot attain renunciation. Varnasrama therefore gives the opportunity for gradual
elevation. Yadu, the son of Maharaja Yayati, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he
wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future.
Maharaja Yadu was different from his brothers. As stated in the next verse, turvasus coditah pitra
druhyus canus ca bharata. pratyacakhyur adharmajnah. Maharaja Yadu's brothers refused to accept their
father's proposal because they were not completely aware of dharma. To accept orders that follow
religious principles, especially the orders of one's father, is very important. Therefore when the brothers
of Maharaja Yadu refused their father's order, this was certainly irreligious. Maharaja Yadu's refusal,
however, was religious. As stated in the Tenth Canto, yados ca dharma-silaya: Maharaja Yadu was
completely aware of the principles of religion. The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in
devotional service to the Lord. Maharaja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord's service, but
there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly
present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one's being
disturbed in rendering service to the Lord. We have actually seen that many sannyasis who accept
sannyasa prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed.
Therefore the general process is to go through grhastha life and vanaprastha life and finally come to
sannyasa and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord. Maharaja Yadu was ready to accept his
father's order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father
would be returned. But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional
service, he did not want to accept his father's old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from
disturbances. Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord Krsna. Therefore, because Yadu
was eager to see the Lord's appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, Yadu refused to accept his
father's proposal. This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu's purpose was to serve the Lord.
Because Yadu was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Krsna appeared in his dynasty. As confirmed in the
prayers of Kunti, yadoh priyasyanvavaye. Yadu was very dear to Krsna, who was therefore eager to
descend in Yadu's dynasty. In conclusion, Maharaja Yadu should not be considered adharma jna, ignorant
of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers. He was like the four Sanakas (catuhsana),
who refused the order of their father, Brahma, for the sake of a better cause. Because the four
Kumaras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as brahmacaris, their refusal
to obey their father's order was not irreligious.

Puru replied: O Your Majesty, who in this world can repay his debt to his father? By the mercy of one's
father, one gets the human form of life, which can enable one to become an associate of the Supreme
Lord.
The father gives the seed of the body, and this seed gradually grows and develops until one ultimately
attains the developed human body, with consciousness higher than that of the animals. In the human
body one can be elevated to the higher planets, and, furthermore, if one cultivates Krsna consciousness,
one can return home, back to Godhead. This important human body is obtained by the grace of the father,
and therefore everyone is indebted to his father. Of course, in other lives one also gets a father and
mother; even cats and dogs have fathers and mothers. But in the human form of life the father and mother
can award their son the greatest benediction by teaching him to become a devotee. When one becomes a
devotee, he achieves the greatest benediction because he completely averts the repetition of birth and
death. Therefore the father who trains his child in Krsna consciousness is the most benevolent father in
this world. It is said:
janame janame sabe pita mata paya
krsna guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei
Everyone gets a father and mother, but if one gets the benediction of Krsna and guru, he can conquer
material nature and return home, back to Godhead.

Puru, Yayati's last son, immediately accepted his father's proposal, for although he was the youngest, he
was very qualified. Puru thought, "I should have accepted my father's proposal before he asked, but I did
not. Therefore I am not a first-class son. I am second class. But I do not wish to become the lowest type of
son, who is compared to his father's stool." One Indian poet has spoken of putra and mutra. putra means
"son," and mutra means "urine." Both a son and urine come from the same genitals. If a son is an
obedient devotee of the Lord he is called putra, or a real son; otherwise, if he is not learned and is not a
devotee, a son is nothing better than urine.

"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be
the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, is one with the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Everything is in Him in the
beginning, and at the end all manifestations enter into Him. He is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya
caham hrdi sannivistah). And from Him everything has emanated (janmady asya yatah). All material
manifestations, however, are temporary. The word svapna means "dreams," maya means "illusion," and
manoratha means "mental creations." Dreams, illusions and mental creations are temporary. Similarly, all
material creation is temporary, but Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the eternal Absolute
Truth.

Although Maharaja Yayati was the king of the entire world and he engaged his mind and five senses in
enjoying material possessions for one thousand years, he was unable to be satisfied.
The kad-indriya, or unpurified senses, can be purified if one engages the senses and the mind in Krsna
consciousness. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam. One must be freed from all designations.
When one identifies himself with the material world, his senses are impure. But when one achieves
spiritual realization and identifies himself as a servant of the Lord, his senses are purified immediately.
Engagement of the purified senses in the service of the Lord is called bhakti. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam
bhaktir ucyate. One may enjoy the senses for many thousands of years, but unless one purifies the senses,
one cannot be happy.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Yayati Regains His Youth."
Chapter Nineteen
King Yayati Achieves Liberation
This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Maharaja Yayati achieved liberation after he recounted the
figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.
After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayati finally
became disgusted with such materialistic happiness. When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a
story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved
Devayani. The story is as follows. Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different
types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat. He became attracted to
this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united. One day
thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry,
abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner, to whom she described her husband's
behavior. The brahmana became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power. Thereupon,
the he-goat begged the brahmana's pardon and was given back the power for sex. Then the he-goat
enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied. If one is lusty and greedy, even
the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one's lusty desires. These desires are like a fire. One
may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished. To
extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process. The sastra therefore advises that by intelligence
one renounce the life of enjoyment. Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot
give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most
learned man. King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons. He
personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyasi, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and
engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord. Thus he attained perfection. Later, when his
beloved wife, Devayani, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the
devotional service of the Lord.

My dearly beloved wife, daughter of Sukracarya, in this world there was someone exactly like me. Please
listen as I narrate the history of his life. By hearing about the life of such a householder, those who have
retired from householder life always lament.
Persons who live in the village or town are called grama-nivasi, and those who live in the forest are
called vana-vasi or vanaprastha. The vanaprasthas, who have retired from family life, generally lament
about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires. Prahlada Maharaja
said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest
well (hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam). If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living
with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself. In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is
recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to vana, the forest.
When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a vanaprastha, he should accept
sannyasa. Vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta. Sannyasa means accepting unalloyed engagement in the
service of the Lord. Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life--brahmacarya,
grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and
not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely vanaprastha and sannyasa.

While wandering in the forest, eating to satisfy his senses, a he-goat by chance approached a well, in
which he saw a she-goat standing helplessly, having fallen into it by the influence of the results of fruitive
activities.
Here Maharaja Yayati compares himself to a he-goat and Devayani to a she-goat and describes the nature
of man and woman. Like a he-goat, a man searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and
a woman without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that has fallen into a well. Without
being cared for by a man, a woman cannot be happy. Indeed, she is just like a she-goat that has fallen into
a well and is struggling for existence. Therefore a woman must take shelter of her father, as Devayani did
when under the care of Sukracarya, and then the father must give the daughter in charity to a suitable
man, or a suitable man should help the woman by placing her under the care of a husband. This is shown
vividly by the life of Devayani. When King Yayati delivered Devayani from the well, she felt great relief
and requested Yayati to accept her as his wife. But when Maharaja Yayati accepted Devayani, he became
too attached and had sex life not only with her but with others, like Sarmistha. Yet still he was
dissatisfied. Therefore one should retire by force from such family life as Yayati's. When one is fully
convinced of the degrading nature of worldly family life, one should completely renounce this way of life,
take sannyasa, and engage himself fully in the service of the Lord. Then one's life will be successful.

Attraction for woman is the impetus for economic development, housing and many other things meant
for living comfortably in this material world. Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was
a laborious task, but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent this labor. Aho grha-ksetrasutapta-

When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she
desired to accept him as her husband. When she did so, many other she-goats also desired him as their
husband because he had a very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert
in discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse. Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost
exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities
and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.
Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham
hi tuccham. Although one becomes a grhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart's content, one
is never satisfied. Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get
the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed. Human beings, however, are meant for selfrealization.
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam
Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (dehino 'smin yatha
dehe). A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body.
However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from
bodily entanglement. Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist
haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily
concept of life.

Aggrieved by her husband's behavior with another, the she-goat thought that the he-goat was not

husband was lusty, she left him and returned to her former maintainer.
The word svaminam is significant. Svami means "caretaker" or "master." Devayani was cared for by
Sukracarya before her marriage, and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayati, but here the word
svaminam indicates that Devayani left the protection of her husband, Yayati, and returned to her former
protector, Sukracarya. Vedic civilization recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man.
During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a

The she-goat went to the residence of a brahmana who was the maintainer of another she-goat, and that
brahmana angrily cut off the he-goat's dangling testicles. But at the he-goat's request, the brahmana later
rejoined them by the power of mystic yoga.
Here Sukracarya is figuratively described as the husband of another she-goat. This indicates that the
relationship between husband and wife in any society, whether higher or lower than human society, is
nothing but the same relationship between he-goat and she-goat, for the material relationship between
man and woman is one of sex. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. Sukracarya was an acarya,
or expert, in family affairs, which involve the transfer of semen from he-goat to she-goat, The words
kascid aja-svami expressly indicate herein that Sukracarya was no better than Yayati, for both of them
were interested in family affairs generated by sukra, or semen. Sukracarya first cursed Yayati to become
old so that he could no longer indulge in sex, but when Sukracarya saw that Yayati's emasculation would
make his own daughter a victim of punishment, he used his mystic power to restore Yayati's masculinity.
Because he used his power of mystic yoga for family affairs and not to realize the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, this exercise in the magic of yoga was no better than the affairs of he-goats and she-goats. Yogic
power should properly be used to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord Himself
recommends in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."

My dear wife, when the he-goat had his testicles restored, he enjoyed the she-goat he had gotten from
the well, but although he continued to enjoy for many, many years, even now he has not been fully
satisfied.
When one is bound by affection for one's wife, one is attached to sexual desires that are very difficult to
overcome. Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, one must voluntarily leave his so-called home and
go to the forest. Pancasordhvam vanam vrajet. Human life is meant for such tapasya, or austerity. By the
austerity of voluntarily stopping sex life at home and going to the forest to engage in spiritual activities in
the association of devotees, one achieves the actual purpose of human life.

spiritual consciousness, household life is nothing but a dark well in which one commits suicide. Prahlada
Maharaja therefore recommended that in due time, at least after one's fiftieth year, one must give up
household life and go to the forest. Vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta. There one should seek shelter at the

A person who is lusty cannot satisfy his mind even if he has enough of everything in this world,

Improvement of one's economic condition is the aim and object of a materialist, but there is no end to
this material advancement, for if one cannot control his lusty desires, he will never be pleased, even if he
gets all the material wealth of the world. In this age we see much material improvement, but still people
are struggling to get more and more material opulence. Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati.
Although every living entity is a part of the Supreme Being, because of lusty desires one continuously
struggles for so-called betterment of one's economic condition. To have a satisfied mind, one must give up
his heart disease of lusty desires. This can be done only when one is Krsna conscious.

If one becomes Krsna conscious, then he can give up this heart disease; otherwise this disease of lusty

On the brahma-bhuta stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is no lamentation and no
material hankering (na socati na kanksati). As long as one lives in the material world, actions and
reactions will continue, but when one is unaffected by such material actions and reactions, he is to be
considered free from the danger of being victimized by material desires. The symptoms of those who are
satiated with lusty desires are described in this verse. As explained by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, when one is not envious even of his enemy, does not expect honor from anyone, but instead
desires all well-being even for his enemy, he is understood to be a paramahamsa, one who has fully
subdued the lusty desires for sense gratification.

For those who are too attached to material enjoyment, sense gratification is very difficult to give up.
Even when one is an invalid because of old age, one cannot give up such desires for sense gratification.
Therefore, one who actually desires happiness must give up such unsatisfied desires, which are the cause
of all tribulations.
We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men who have reached more than
eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and pay heavy fees to drink wine and associate with women.
Although such men are too old to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased. Time deteriorates even
the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and
invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the desires of his
senses. Therefore, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, one should give up his lusty desires. As explained by Sri
Yamunacarya:
yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatam rantum asit
tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikarah susthu-nisthivanam ca
When one is Krsna conscious, he gets more and more happiness by discharging duties for Krsna. Such a
person spits on sense gratification, especially that of sexual enjoyment. An experienced, advanced devotee
is no longer interested in sex life. The strong desire for sex can be subdued only by advancement in Krsna
consciousness.

One should not allow oneself to sit on the same seat even with one's own mother, sister or daughter, for
the senses are so strong that even though one is very advanced in knowledge, he may be attracted by sex.
Learning the etiquette of how to deal with women does not free one from sexual attraction. As
specifically mentioned herewith, such attraction is possible even with one's mother, sister or daughter.
Generally, of course, one is not sexually attracted to his mother, sister or daughter, but if one allows
himself to sit very close to such a woman, one may be attracted. This is a psychological fact. It may be said
that one is liable to be attracted if he is not very advanced in civilized life; however, as specifically
mentioned here, vidvamsam api karsati: even if one is highly advanced, materially or spiritually, he may
be attracted by lusty desires. The object of attraction may even be one's mother, sister or daughter.
Therefore, one should be extremely careful in dealings with women. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was most
strict in such dealings, especially after He accepted the sannyasa order. Indeed, no woman could come
near Him to offer Him respect. Again, one is warned herewith that one should be extremely careful in
dealings with women. A brahmacari is forbidden even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens
to be young. The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from the disciple of her
husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of the spiritual master is young, a brahmacari is
forbidden to render service to her.

Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Free from the dualities of mental concoction and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with
the animals.
To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty desires. Unless one gives up such desires, one's
mind cannot be freed from material contamination. Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed
from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the
forest. pancasordhvam vanam vrajet. After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and
go to the forest. The best forest is Vrndavana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves Vrndavana. Cultivating Krsna consciousness
in Vrndavana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in Vrndavana one can
automatically meditate upon Krsna. Vrndavana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples
one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Radha-Krsna or Krsna-Balarama and meditate upon this
form. As expressed here by the words brahmany adhyaya, one should concentrate one's mind upon the
Supreme Lord, Parabrahman. This Parabrahman is Krsna, as confirmed by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita
(param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan). Krsna and His abode, Vrndavana, are not
different. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, aradhyo bhagavan vrajesa-tanayas tad-dhama vrndavanam.
Vrndavana is as good as Krsna. Therefore, if one somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in
Vrndavana, and if one is not a pretender but simply lives in Vrndavana and concentrates his mind upon
Krsna, one is liberated from material bondage. One's mind is not purified, however, even in Vrndavana, if
one is agitated by lusty desires. One should not live in Vrndavana and commit offenses, for a life of
offenses in Vrndavana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there. Many monkeys and hogs
live in Vrndavana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires. Men who have gone to Vrndavana
but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave Vrndavana and stop their grievous offenses at the
lotus feet of the Lord. There are many misguided men who live in Vrndavana to satisfy their sexual
desires, but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs. Those who are under the control of
maya, and specifically under the control of lusty desires, are called maya-mrga. Indeed, everyone in the
conditional stage of material life is a maya-mrga. It is said, maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad: Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa to show His causeless mercy to the maya-mrgas, the people of this
material world, who suffer because of lusty desires. One should follow the principles of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and always think of Krsna in full Krsna consciousness. Then one will be eligible to live in
Vrndavana, and his life will be successful.

enjoy or even think of such things, is the knower of the self. Such a self-realized person knows quite well
that material happiness is the very cause of continued material existence and forgetfulness of one's own
constitutional position.
The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his encagement. This is the beginning of
spiritual understanding.
dehino 'smin yatha dehe

dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
(Bg. 2.13) The real mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material body. Therefore
Krsna descends to teach the conditioned soul about spiritual realization and how to become free from
material bondage. Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata. The words dharmasya glanih mean
"pollution of one's existence." Our existence is now polluted, and it must be purified (sattvam suddhyet).
The human life is meant for this purification, not for thinking of happiness in terms of the external body,
which is the cause of material bondage. Therefore, in this verse, Maharaja Yayati advises that whatever
material happiness we see and whatever is promised for enjoyment is all merely flickering and temporary.
Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna. Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, if one is not freed
from material bondage one must return to this planet earth and continue in the miserable condition of
material existence (bhutva bhutva praliyate). One should always keep this understanding in mind so as
not to be allured by any kind of sense enjoyment, in this life or in the next. One who is fully aware of this
truth is self-realized (sa atma-drk), but aside from him, everyone suffers in the cycle of birth and death
(mrtyu-samsara-vartmani). This understanding is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to this is
but a cause of unhappiness. Krsna-bhakta--niskama, ataeva 'santa.' Only a Krsna conscious person, who
knows the aim and object of life, is peaceful. All others, whether karmis, jnanis or yogis, are restless and
cannot enjoy real peace.

That Maharaja Yayati was immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life is certainly
astonishing. But the example given herewith is appropriate. A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father
and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown. Similarly, if one
fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of
conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami). As stated
in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):
kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa
abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah
ye 'nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah
"Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha, Yavana and the Khasa races and even others
addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme
power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him." Lord Visnu is so powerful that He can deliver
anyone at once if He is pleased to do so. And Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, can
be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Maharaja Yayati did.
Maharaja Yayati was eager to serve Vasudeva, Krsna, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce
material life, Lord Vasudeva helped him. We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves
unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned
life. This is clearly expressed in the next verse.

sah--Maharaja Yayati; tatra--upon doing this; nirmukta--was immediately liberated from; samastasangah--
all contamination; atma-anubhutya--simply by understanding his constitutional position;
vidhuta--was cleansed of; tri-lingah--the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature
(sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna); pare--unto the Transcendence; amale--without material contact;
brahmani--the Supreme Lord; vasudeve--Vasudeva, Krsna, the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan; lebhe--achieved;
gatim--the destination; bhagavatim--as an associate of the Supreme personality of Godhead; pratitah--
famous.
Because King Yayati completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, he
was freed from all contamination of the material modes of nature. Because of his self-realization, he was
able to fix his mind upon the Transcendence [Parabrahman, Vasudeva], and thus he ultimately achieved
the position of an associate of the Lord.
The word vidhuta, meaning "cleansed," is very significant. Everyone in this material world is
contaminated (karanam guna-sango 'sya). Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated
either by sattva-guna, by rajo-guna or by tamo-guna. Even if one becomes a qualified brahmana in the
mode of goodness (sattva-guna), he is still materially contaminated. One must come to the platform of
suddha-sattva, transcending the sattva-guna. Then one is vidhuta-trilinga, cleansed of the contamination
caused by the three modes of material nature. This is possible by the mercy of Krsna. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt-satam
"Sri Krsna, the personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard
and chanted." A person trying to be perfectly Krsna conscious by hearing the words of Krsna from
Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita certainly has all the dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu also says, ceto-darpana-marjanam: the process of hearing and chanting the glories
of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart. As soon as one is
freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Maharaja Yayati was, one's original position as an
associate of the Lord is revealed. This is called svarupa-siddhi, or personal perfection.

srutva gatham devayani
mene prastobham atmanah
stri-pumsoh sneha-vaiklavyat

srutva--hearing; gatham--the narration; devayani--Queen Devayani, the wife of Maharaja Yayati; mene--
understood; prastobham atmanah--when instructed for her self-realization; stri-pumsoh--between the
husband and wife; sneha-vaiklavyat--from an exchange of love and affection; parihasam--a funny joke or
story; iva--like; iritam--spoken (by Maharaja Yayati).
When Devayani heard Maharaja Yayati's story of the he-goat and she-goat, she understood that this
story, which was presented as if a funny joke for entertainment between husband and wife, was intended
to awaken her to her constitutional position.
When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his real position as an eternal servant of
Krsna. This is called liberation. Muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih (Bhag. 2.10.6). Under
the influence of maya, everyone living in this material world thinks that he is the master of everything
(ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate). One thinks that there is no God or controller and that one
is independent and can do anything. This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this
ignorance, he is called liberated. Maharaja Yayati had delivered Devayani from the well, and finally, as a
dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her
from the misconception of material happiness. Devayani was quite competent to understand her liberated
husband, and therefore she decided to follow him as his faithful wife.

Thereafter, Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya, understood that the materialistic association of
husband, friends and relatives is like the association in a hotel full of tourists. The relationships of society,
friendship and love are created by the maya of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream.
By the grace of Krsna, Devayani gave up her imaginary position in the material world. Completely fixing
her mind upon Krsna, she achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.
One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman, Krsna, but
has somehow or other been entrapped by the material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting
of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. One should know that the association of
society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are nothing but creations of maya. One's only
business is to become Krsna conscious and render service unto Krsna as extensively as possible for a
living being. In this way one is liberated from material bondage. By the grace of Krsna, Devayani attained
this state through the instructions of her husband.

this is due to Your all-pervading nature and Your fullness in all opulences. I therefore offer my respectful
obeisances unto You.
How Devayani became self-realized by the grace of her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, is described
here. Describing such realization is another way of performing the bhakti process.
sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
"Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes
of Lord Visnu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship,
offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and
surrendering everything unto Him--these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service." (Bhag.
7.5.23) sravanam kirtanam, hearing and chanting, are especially important. By hearing from her husband
about the greatness of Lord Vasudeva, Devayani certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto
the lotus feet of the Lord (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya). This is knowledge. Bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate. Surrender to Vasudeva is the result of hearing about Him for many, many
births. As soon as one surrenders unto Vasudeva, one is liberated immediately. Because of her association
with her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, Devayani became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga,
and thus became liberated.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Yayati Achieves Liberation."
Chapter Twenty
The Dynasty of Puru
This chapter describes the history of Puru and his descendant Dusmanta. The son of Puru was
Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan. The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after
another, were Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Samyati, Ahamyati and Raudrasva.
Raudrasva had ten sons--Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu, Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu,
Vrateyu and Vaneyu. The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons--Sumati, Dhruva and
Apratiratha. The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva's son was Medhatithi. The sons of Medhatithi,
headed by Praskanna, were all brahmanas. The son of Rantinava named Sumati had a son named Rebhi,
and his son was Dusmanta.
While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an
extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her. That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and
her name was Sakuntala. Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the forest, where Kanva Muni
found her. Kanva Muni brought her to his asrama, where he raised and maintained her. When Sakuntala
accepted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gandharva-vidhi. Sakuntala
later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his
kingdom.
In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but Dusmanta, having returned to the
capital, forgot what had taken place. Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born
child, Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son. Later, however, after a mysterious
omen, the King accepted them. After Maharaja Dusmanta's death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was
enthroned. He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brahmanas.
This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as
his son.

There are many historical instances by which we can understand that from ksatriyas many brahmanas
have been born and that from brahmanas many ksatriyas have been born. The Lord Himself says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to the three modes
of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by
Me." Therefore, regardless of the family in which one takes birth, when one is qualified with the
symptoms of a particular section, he is to be described accordingly. Yal-laksanam proktam. One's place in
the varna divisions of society is determined according to one's symptoms or qualities. This is maintained
everywhere in the sastra. Birth is a secondary consideration; the first consideration is one's qualities and
activities.

King Dusmanta replied: O Sakuntala, with beautiful eyebrows, you have taken your birth in the family
of the great saint Visvamitra, and your reception is quite worthy of your family. Aside from this, the
daughters of a king generally select their own husbands.
In her reception of Maharaja Dusmanta, Sakuntala clearly said, "Your Majesty may stay here, and you
may accept whatever reception I can offer." Thus she indicated that she wanted Maharaja Dusmanta as
her husband. As far as Maharaja Dusmanta was concerned, he desired Sakuntala as his wife from the very
beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural. To induce
Sakuntala to accept the marriage, Maharaja Dusmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she
could select her husband in an open assembly. In the history of Aryan civilization there have been many
instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions. For example, it
was in such a competition that Sitadevi accepted Lord Ramacandra as her husband and that Draupadi
accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances. So marriage by agreement or by selecting one's own
husband in an open competition is allowed. There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by
agreement is called gandharva marriage. Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their
daughter or son, but gandharva marriage takes place by personal selection. Still, although marriage by
personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by
disagreement. Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by
agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal ksatriya families. Maharaja
Dusmanta's acceptance of Sakuntala as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture. How the marriage took
place is described in the next verse.

When Sakuntala responded to Maharaja Dusmanta's proposal with silence, the agreement was complete.
Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic pranava
[omkara], in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.
The omkara, pranava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters. Bhagavad-gita says
that the letters a-u-m, combined together as om, represent the Supreme Lord. Religious principles are
meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who says in
Bhagavad-gita that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles.
The word vidhina means, "according to religious principles." The association of men and women
according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture. In our Krsna consciousness movement
we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as
friends is irreligious and is not allowed.

When the King refused to accept his wife and son, who were both irreproachable, an unembodied voice
spoke from the sky as an omen and was heard by everyone present.
Maharaja Dusmanta knew that Sakuntala and the boy were his own wife and son, but because they came
from outside and were unknown to the citizens, he at first declined to accept them. Sakuntala, however,
was so chaste that an omen from the sky declared the truth so that others could hear. When everyone
heard from the omen that Sakuntala and her child were truly the King's wife and son, the King gladly
accepted them.

The voice said: O Maharaja Dusmanta, a son actually belongs to his father, whereas the mother is only a
container, like the skin of a bellows. According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son.
Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult Sakuntala.
According to the Vedic injunction atma vai putra-namasi, the father becomes the son. The mother is
simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is
responsible for maintaining the son. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all
living entities (aham bija-pradah pita), and therefore He is responsible for maintaining them. This is also
confirmed in the Vedas. Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: although God is one, He maintains all living
entities with their necessities for life. The living entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and
therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different bodies. The small
ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat.
Therefore there is no question of overpopulation. Because the father, Krsna, is fully opulent, there is no
scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth.
Actually one suffers for want of food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to
supply him food. It is the living entity's position that determines whether food will be supplied or not.
When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the
diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied with food. In Bhagavad-gita (7.10) the Lord
also says, bijam mam sama-bhutanam: "I am the seed of all living entities." A particular type of seed is
sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out. The mother resembles the
earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth.

tvam--your good self; ca--and; asya--of this child; dhata--the creator; garbhasya--of the embryo; satyam--

O King Dusmanta, he who discharges semen is the actual father, and his son saves him from the custody
of Yamaraja. You are the actual procreator of this child. Indeed, Sakuntala is speaking the truth.
Upon hearing the omen, Maharaja Dusmanta accepted his wife and child. According to Vedic smrti:
pun-namno narakad yasmat
pitaram trayate sutah
tasmat putra iti proktah
svayam eva svayambhuva
Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called put, the son is called putra.
According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father,
not the mother, who is delivered by the son. But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband,
when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered. Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce
in the Vedic literature. A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her
achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition. This verse clearly says, putro nayati
naradeva yama-ksayat: "The son saves his father from the custody of Yamaraja." It never says, putro nayati
mataram: "The son saves his mother." The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother.
Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for if they have a child whom
they raise to be a Vaisnava, he can save both the father and mother from the custody of Yamaraja and
punishment in hellish life.

Maharaja Bharata, the son of Dusmanta, had the mark of Lord Krsna's disc on the palm of his right
hand, and he had the mark of a lotus whorl on the soles of his feet. By worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire
world. Then, under the priesthood of Mamateya, Bhrgu Muni, he performed fifty-five horse sacrifices on
the bank of the Ganges, beginning from its mouth and ending at its source, and seventy-eight horse
sacrifices on the bank of the Yamuna, beginning from the confluence at Prayaga and ending at the source.
He established the sacrificial fire on an excellent site, and he distributed great wealth to the brahmanas.
Indeed, he distributed so many cows that each of thousands of brahmanas had one badva [13,084] as his
share.
As indicated here by the words dausmanter agnih saci-gune citah, Bharata, the son of Maharaja
Dusmanta, arranged for many ritualistic ceremonies all over the world, especially all over India on the
banks of the Ganges and Yamuna, from the mouth to the source, and all such sacrifices were performed in
very distinguished places. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karmabandhanah:
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this
material world." Everyone should engage in the performance of yajna, and the sacrificial fire should be
ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in
spiritual life. Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were
qualified brahmanas who could perform such yajnas. For the present, however, the Brahma-vaivarta
Purana enjoins:
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau panca vivarjayet
"In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice,
accepting the order of sannyasa, offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the
wife of one's brother." In this age, such yajnas as the asvamedha-yajna and gomedha-yajna are impossible
to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified brahmanas. This verse says,
mamateyam purodhaya: Maharaja Bharata engaged the son of Mamata, Bhrgu Muni, to take charge of
performing this yajna. Now, however, such brahmanas are impossible to find. Therefore the sastras
recommend, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are intelligent should perform
the sankirtana-yajna inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
"In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is
accompanied by His associates, by performance of sankirtana-yajna." (Bhag. 11.5.32) Yajna must be
performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely. Therefore
the Krsna consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna all over
the world. This Hare Krsna movement is also yajna, but without the difficulties involved in securing
paraphernalia and qualified brahmanas. This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and
everywhere. If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajna
will be fulfilled. The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be
any produce (annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna-sambhavah). All our necessities can be produced
simply by rainfall (kamam vavarsa parjanyah), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (sarvakama-
dugha mahi). In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain
from the four principles of sinful life--illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling--and in a pure
state of existence should perform the simple yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Then the
earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically,
socially, religiously and culturally. Everything will be in proper order.

Mamata very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and
therefore she considered giving up the child. But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a
name for the child.
According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as jata-karma
and nama-karana, in which learned brahmanas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope
according to astrological calculations. But the child to which Mamata gave birth was begotten by
Brhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamata was the wife of Utathya, Brhaspati made her pregnant by
force. Therefore Brhaspati became bharta. According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of
her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dvaja. The common word still current in Hindu society
for such a son is dogla, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother. In such a
situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles. Mamata,
therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvaja, which
indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamata and Brhaspati.

"O Brhaspati, you maintain him!" After speaking in this way, Brhaspati and Mamata both left. Thus the
child was known as Bharadvaja.

Although encouraged by the demigods to maintain the child, Mamata considered him useless because of

the child, and when Maharaja Bharata was disappointed for want of a child, this child was given to him as
his son.
From this verse it is understood that those who are rejected from the higher planetary system are given
a chance to take birth in the most exalted families on this planet earth.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Dynasty of Puru."
Chapter Twenty-one
The Dynasty of Bharata
The Dynasty of Bharata;
This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Maharaja Bharata, the son of Maharaja
Dusmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamidha and others.
The son of Bharadvaja was Manyu, and Manyu's sons were Brhatksatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara and
Garga. Of these five, Nara had a son named Sankrti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva. As an
exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the
Supreme Lord and His devotees. Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own
food in charity, and he and his family would fast. Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not
even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a
brahmana guest appeared. Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a
portion of it to the brahmana. When the brahmana left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants
of the food, a sudra appeared. Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the sudra and himself.
Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared. Rantideva
therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the
water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him
the water. This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and
show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,
being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service. The special power
to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure
devotee, not to ordinary devotees.
Garga, the son of Bharadvaja, had a son named Sini, and Sini's son was Gargya. Although Gargya was a
ksatriya by birth, his sons became brahmanas. The son of Mahavirya was Duritaksaya, whose sons were of
a ksatriya king, they also achieved the position of brahmanas. The son of Brhatksatra constructed the city
of Hastinapura and was known as Hasti. His sons were Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha.
From Ajamidha came Priyamedha and other brahmanas and also a son named Brhadisu. The sons,
grandsons and further descendants of Brhadisu were Brhaddhanu, Brhatkaya, Jayadratha, Visada and
Syenajit. From Syenajit came four sons--Rucirasva, Drdhahanu, Kasya and Vatsa. From Rucirasva came a
son named Para, whose sons were Prthusena and Nipa, and from Nipa came one hundred sons. Another
son of Nipa was Brahmadatta. From Brahmadatta came Visvaksena; from Visvaksena, Udaksena; and from
Udaksena, Bhallata.
The son of Dvimidha was Yavinara, and from Yavinara came many sons and grandsons, such as
Krtiman, Satyadhrti, Drdhanemi, Suparsva, Sumati, Sannatiman, Krti, Nipa, Udgrayudha, Ksemya, Suvira,
Ripunjaya and Bahuratha. Purumidha had no sons, but Ajamidha, in addition to his other sons, had a son
named Nila, whose son was Santi. The descendants of Santi were Susanti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyasva.
Bharmyasva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brahmanas. Mudgala had twins--a
son, Divodasa, and a daughter, Ahalya. From Ahalya, by her husband, Gautama, Satananda was born. The
son of Satananda was Satyadhrti, and his son was Saradvan. Saradvan's son was known as Krpa, and
Saradvan's daughter, known as Krpi, became the wife of Dronacarya.

Rantideva never endeavored to earn anything. He would enjoy whatever he got by the arrangement of
providence, but when guests came he would give them everything. Thus he underwent considerable
suffering, along with the members of his family. Indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of
food and water, yet Rantideva always remained sober. Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the
morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and
his family were about to eat, a brahmana guest arrived.

tasmai--unto him (the brahmana); samvyabhajat--after dividing, gave his share; sah--he (Rantideva);

sarvatra--everywhere, or in the heart of every living being; sampasyan--conceiving; sah--he; bhuktva--after
eating the food; prayayau--left that place; dvijah--the brahmana.
Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead everywhere, and in every living
entity, he received the guest with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food. The brahmana guest
ate his share and then went away.
Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he
never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be
God. Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another. He perceived the presence of the Lord
both in the brahmana and in the candala. This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord
Himself in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva sva-pake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." A pandita, or learned person, perceives the presence
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being. Therefore, although it has now become
fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-narayana, or "poor Narayana," Rantideva had no
reason to give preference to any one person. The idea that because Narayana is present in the heart of one
who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-narayana is a wrong conception. By such
logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be
Narayana. One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view. Rather, he saw
everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunah). It is not that
everyone is the Supreme Godhead. Such a theory, which is propounded by the Mayavada philosophy, is
always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.

Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own
share when a sudra guest arrived. Seeing the sudra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.
Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he never
distinguished between the brahmana and the sudra, the poor and the rich. Such equal vision is called
sama-darsinah (panditah sama-darsinah). One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is situated in everyone's heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any
distinction between the brahmana and the sudra, the poor (daridra) and the rich (dhani). Such a person
sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.

Vasudeva Datta made a similar statement to Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, requesting the Lord to liberate all
living entities in His presence. Vasudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself
would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaisnava
is therefore described as being para-duhkha-duhkhi, very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As
such, a Vaisnava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society.

King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from the demigods. He offered them

Godhead, he fixed his mind at Lord Visnu's lotus feet.
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:

If one wants to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, one should not hanker to take benedictions
from the demigods. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nyadevatah:
those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva, he did not hanker to take material benefits from them. Rather, he fixed his mind upon Lord
Vasudeva and rendered devotional service unto Him. This is the sign of a pure devotee, whose heart is not
adulterated by material desires.

isvara-alambanam--completely taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord; cittam--his
consciousness; kurvatah--fixing; ananya-radhasah--for Rantideva, who was undeviating and desired
nothing other than to serve the Supreme Lord; maya--the illusory energy; guna-mayi--consisting of the
three modes of nature; rajan--O Maharaja Pariksit; svapna-vat--like a dream; pratyaliyata--merged.
O Maharaja Pariksit, because King Rantideva was a pure devotee, always Krsna conscious and free from
all material desires, the Lord's illusory energy, maya, could not exhibit herself before him. On the
contrary, for him maya entirely vanished, exactly like a dream.
As it is said:
krsna----surya-sama; maya haya andhakara
yahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara
Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure Krsna conscious person
there can be no existence of maya. The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." If one wants to be free from the
influence of maya, the illusory energy, one must become Krsna conscious and always keep Krsna
prominent within the core of his heart. In Bhagavad-gita (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of
Him (man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru). In this way, by always being Krsnaminded
or Krsna conscious, one can surpass the influence of maya (mayam etam taranti te). Because
Rantideva was Krsna conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy. The word
svapnavat is significant in this connection. Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in
materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one's dreams. When
one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind. Similarly, as long as one is
under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Krsna
conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.

was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Narayana, by the king's transcendental association. This is the influence of a pure
devotee. If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees.
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said that a Vaisnava is meritorious in proportion to the number of
devotees he has created. A Vaisnava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number
of devotees he has created for the Lord. Here the word rantidevanuvartinah indicates that Rantideva's
officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaisnavas by his association. In other words,
Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or maha-bhagavata. Mahat-sevam dvaram ahur
vimukteh: one should render service to such mahatmas, for then one will automatically achieve the goal
of liberation. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has also said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: one
cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaisnava, the door to
liberation is open.

came from him a generation of brahmanas. From Mahavirya came a son named Duritaksaya, whose sons
were Trayyaruni, Kavi and Puskararuni. Although these sons of Duritaksaya took birth in a dynasty of
ksatriyas, they too attained the position of brahmanas. Brhatksatra had a son named Hasti, who

From King Hasti came three sons, named Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha. The descendants of
Ajamidha, headed by Priyamedha, all achieved the position of brahmanas.
This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of Bhagavad-gita that the orders of society--
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (guna-karmavibhagasah).
All the descendants of Ajamidha, who was a ksatriya, became brahmanas. This was certainly
because of their qualities and activities. Similarly, sometimes the sons of brahmanas or ksatriyas become
vaisyas (brahmana-vaisyatam gatah). When a ksatriya or brahmana adopts the occupation or duty of a
vaisya (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam), he is certainly counted as a vaisya. On the other hand, if one is born a
vaisya, by his activities he can become a brahmana. This is confirmed by Narada Muni. Yasya yallaksanam
proktam. The members of the varnas, or social orders--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--
must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.

wife, Sarasvati.
The Suka mentioned here is different from the Sukadeva Gosvami who spoke Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vyasadeva, is described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta purana.
There it is said that Vyasadeva maintained the daughter of Jabali as his wife and that after they performed
penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb. The child remained in the womb of his
mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not
come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of maya. Vyasadeva then assured the
child that he would not be influenced by maya, but the child did not believe his father, for the father was
still attached to his wife and children. Vyasadeva then went to Dvaraka and informed the Personality of
Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyasadeva's request, went to Vyasadeva's
cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by maya. Thus assured,
the child came out, but he immediately went away as a parivrajakacarya. When the father, very much
aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Sukadeva Gosvami, the boy created a duplicate Sukadeva, who
later entered family life. Therefore, the suka-kanya, or daughter of Sukadeva, mentioned in this verse is
the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Sukadeva. The original Sukadeva was a lifelong brahmacari.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Dynasty of Bharata."
Chapter Twenty-two
The Descendants of Ajamidha
This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa. It also describes Jarasandha, who belonged to the
Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.
The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after another--Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and
Somaka. Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada was
born. Drupada's daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed by Dhrstadyumna. Dhrstadyumna's
son was Dhrstaketu.
Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa. From Rksa came a son named Samvarana, and from
Samvarana came Kuru, the king of Kuruksetra. Kuru had four sons--Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.
Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu.
The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings
of the Cedi state. In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kusagra, Rsabha, Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu,
and from Brhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva,
Somapi and Srutasrava. Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons. Among the descendants of Jahnu were
Suratha, Viduratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena, Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Rksa, Dilipa and
Pratipa.
The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika. When Devapi retired to the forest, his younger
brother Santanu became the king. Although Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the
throne, he disregarded his elder brother. Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years. Following
the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready to return the kingdom to Devapi, but by the intrigue of
Santanu's minister, Devapi became unfit to be king. Therefore Santanu resumed charge of the kingdom,
and rain fell properly during his regime. By mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as
Kalapa-grama. In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vamsa (the lunar
dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon. The
wife of Santanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities. Two sons named
Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and
Vyasadeva was born from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara, Vyasadeva instructed the history of the
Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva. Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya,
Vyasadeva begot Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.
Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duhsala. Pandu
had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi. The names
of these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti, Satanika and Srutakarma. Besides these
five sons, by other wives the Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata,
Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. From Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was
born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four sons--Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.
Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu family. From Janamejaya, he said,
would come a son named Satanika, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Asvamedhaja,
Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstiman, Susena, Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava,
Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpanjaya, Durva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satanika, Durdamana, Mahinara,
Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.
Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-vamsa, or Magadha dynasty. Sahadeva, the
son of Jarasandha, would beget Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava. Subsequently taking birth
in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena, Karmajit, Sutanjaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema,
Suvrata, Dharmasutra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripunjaya.

The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika. Devapi left the kingdom of his father and went to
the forest, and therefore Santanu became the king. Santanu, who in his previous birth was known as
Mahabhisa, had the ability to transform anyone from old age to youth simply by touching that person
with his hands.

Because the King was able to make everyone happy for sense gratification, primarily by the touch of his
hand, his name was Santanu. Once, when there was no rainfall in the kingdom for twelve years and the
King consulted his learned brahminical advisors, they said, "You are faulty for enjoying the property of
your elder brother. For the elevation of your kingdom and home, you should return the kingdom to him."
One cannot enjoy sovereignty or perform an agnihotra-yajna in the presence of one's elder brother, or
else one becomes a usurper, known as parivetta.

When the brahmanas said this, Maharaja Santanu went to the forest and requested his elder brother
Devapi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects. Previously,
however, Santanu's minister Asvavara had instigated some brahmanas to induce Devapi to transgress the
injunctions of the Vedas and thus make himself unfit for the post of ruler. The brahmanas deviated
Devapi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore when asked by Santanu he did not agree to
accept the post of ruler. On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen.
Under the circumstances, Santanu again became the king, and Indra, being pleased, showered rains.
Devapi later took to the path of mystic yoga to control his mind and senses and went to the village named
Kalapagrama, where he is still living.

Bhismadeva was the foremost of all warriors. When he defeated Lord Parasurama in a fight, Lord
Parasurama was very satisfied with him. By the semen of Santanu in the womb of Satyavati, the daughter
of a fisherman, Citrangada took birth.
Satyavati was actually the daughter of Uparicara Vasu by the womb of a fisherwoman known as
Matsyagarbha. Later, Satyavati was raised by a fisherman.
The fight between Parasurama and Bhismadeva concerns three daughters of Kasiraja--Ambika, Ambalika
and Amba--who were forcibly abducted by Bhismadeva, acting on behalf of his brother Vicitravirya. Amba
thought that Bhismadeva would marry her and became attached to him, but Bhismadeva refused to marry
her, for he had taken the vow of brahmacarya. Amba therefore approached Bhismadeva's military spiritual
master, Parasurama, who instructed Bhisma to marry her. Bhismadeva refused, and therefore Parasurama
fought with him to force him to accept the marriage. But Parasurama was defeated, and he was pleased
with Bhisma.

Citrangada, of whom Vicitravirya was the younger brother, was killed by a Gandharva who was also
named Citrangada. Satyavati, before her marriage to Santanu, gave birth to the master authority of the
Vedas, Vyasadeva, known as Krsna Dvaipayana, who was begotten by Parasara Muni. From Vyasadeva, I
[Sukadeva Gosvami] was born, and from him I studied this great work of literature, Srimad-Bhagavatam.
The incarnation of Godhead Vedavyasa, rejecting his disciples, headed by Paila, instructed Srimad-
Bhagavatam to me because I was free from all material desires. After Ambika and Ambalika, the two
daughters of Kasiraja, were taken away by force, Vicitravirya married them, but because he was too
attached to these two wives, he had a heart attack and died of tuberculosis.

maidservant. These sons were Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.
Vicitravirya died of tuberculosis, and his wives, Ambika and Ambalika, had no issue. Therefore, after
Vicitravirya's death, his mother, Satyavati, who was also the mother of Vyasadeva, asked Vyasadeva to
beget children through the wives of Vicitravirya. In those days, the brother of the husband could beget
children through the womb of his sister-in-law. This was known as devarena sutotpatti. If the husband
was somehow unable to beget children, his brother could do so through the womb of his sister-in-law.
This devarena sutotpatti and the sacrifices of asvamedha and gomedha are forbidden in the age of Kali.

Nakula begot a son named Naramitra through his wife named Karenumati. Similarly, Arjuna begot a son
named Iravan through his wife known as Ulupi, the daughter of the Nagas, and a son named
Babhruvahana by the womb of the princess of Manipura. Babhruvahana became the adopted son of the
king of Manipura.
It is to be understood that Parvati is the daughter of the king of the very, very old mountainous country
known as the Manipura state. Five thousand years ago, therefore, when the Pandavas ruled, Manipura
existed, as did its king. Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic Vaisnava kingdom. If this
kingdom is organized as a Vaisnava state, this revitalization will be a great success because for five
thousand years this state has maintained its identity. If the Vaisnava spirit is revived there, it will be a
wonderful place, renowned throughout the entire world. Manipuri Vaisnavas are very famous in Vaisnava
society. In Vrndavana and Navadvipa there are many temples constructed by the king of Manipura. Some
of our devotees belong to the Manipura state. The Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, can be well
spread in the state of Manipura by the cooperative efforts of the Krsna conscious devotees.

the above-mentioned kings appear on the surface of the globe.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Descendants of Ajamidha."
Chapter Twenty-three
The Dynasties of the Sons of Yayati
In this Twenty-third Chapter the dynasties of Anu, Druhyu, Turvasu and Yadu, as well as the story of
Jyamagha, are described.
The sons of Yayati's fourth son, Anu, were Sabhanara, Caksu and Paresnu. Of these three, the sons and
grandsons of Sabhanara were, in succession, Kalanara, Srnjaya, Janamejaya, Mahasala and Mahamana. The
sons of Mahamana were Usinara and Titiksu. Usinara had four sons, namely Sibi, Vara, Krmi and Daksa.
Sibi also had four sons--Vrsadarbha, Sudhira, Madra and Kekaya. The son of Titiksu was Rusadratha, who
begot a son named Homa. From Homa came Sutapa and from Sutapa, Bali. In this way the dynasty
continued. Begotten by Dirghatama in the womb of the wife of Bali were Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Suhma,
Pundra and Odra, all of whom became kings.
From Anga came Khalapana, whose dynasty included Diviratha, Dharmaratha and Citraratha, also
called Romapada, one after another. Maharaja Dasaratha gave in charity one of his daughters, by the name
Santa, to his friend Romapada because Romapada had no sons. Romapada accepted Santa as his daughter,
and the great sage Rsyasrnga married her. By the mercy of Rsyasrnga, Romapada had a son named
Caturanga. The son of Caturanga was Prthulaksa, who had three sons--Brhadratha, Brhatkarma and
Brhadbhanu. From Brhadratha came a son named Brhadmana, whose sons and grandsons in succession
were Jayadratha, Vijaya, Dhrti, Dhrtavrata, Satkarma and Adhiratha. Adhiratha accepted the son rejected
by Kunti, namely Karna, and Karna's son was Vrsasena.
The son of Yayati's third son, Druhyu, was Babhru, whose son and grandsons were Setu, Arabdha,
Gandhara, Dharma, Dhrta, Durmada and Praceta.
The son of Yayati's second son, Turvasu, was Vahni, whose seminal dynasty included Bharga,
Bhanuman, Tribhanu, Karandhama and Maruta. The childless Maruta accepted Dusmanta, who belonged
to the Puru dynasty, as his adopted son. Maharaja Dusmanta was anxious to have his kingdom returned,
and so he went back to the Puru-vamsa.
Of the four sons of Yadu, Sahasrajit was the eldest. The son of Sahasrajit was named Satajit. He had
three sons, of whom one was Haihaya. The sons and grandsons in the dynasty of Haihaya were Dharma,
Netra, Kunti, Sohanji, Mahisman, Bhadrasenaka, Dhanaka, Krtavirya, Arjuna, Jayadhvaja, Talajangha and
Vitihotra.
The son of Vitihotra was Madhu, whose eldest son was Vrsni. Because of Yadu, Madhu and Vrsni, their
dynasties are known as Yadava, Madhava and Vrsni. Another son of Yadu was Krosta, and from him came
Vrjinavan, Svahita, Visadgu, Citraratha, Sasabindu, Prthusrava, Dharma, Usana and Rucaka. Rucaka had
five sons, one of whom was known as Jyamagha. Jyamagha was sonless, but by the mercy of the demigods
his childless wife gave birth to a son named Vidarbha.

From Diviratha came a son named Dharmaratha, and his son was Citraratha, who was celebrated as
Romapada. Romapada, however, was without issue, and therefore his friend Maharaja Dasaratha gave him
his own daughter, named Santa. Romapada accepted her as his daughter, and thereafter she married
Rsyasrnga. When the demigods from the heavenly planets failed to shower rain, Rsyasrnga was appointed
the priest for performing a sacrifice, after being brought from the forest by the allurement of prostitutes,
who danced, staged theatrical performances accompanied by music, and embraced and worshiped him.
After Rsyasrnga came, the rain fell. Thereafter, Rsyasrnga performed a son-giving sacrifice on behalf of
Maharaja Dasaratha, who had no issue, and then Maharaja Dasaratha had sons. From Romapada, by the
mercy of Rsyasrnga, Caturanga was born, and from Caturanga came Prthulaksa.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, the Supersoul in the hearts of all living entities, descended
in His original form as a human being in the dynasty or family of Yadu. Yadu had four sons, named
Sahasrajit, Krosta, Nala and Ripu. Of these four, the eldest, Sahasrajit, had a son named Satajit, who had
three sons, named Mahahaya, Renuhaya and Haihaya.
As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." The majority of transcendentalists understand only the impersonal Brahman or
localized Paramatma, for the Personality of Godhead is very difficult to understand. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." The yogis and jnanis--that is, the mystic yogis and the
impersonalists--can understand the Absolute Truth as impersonal or localized, but although such realized
souls are above ordinary human beings, they cannot understand how the Supreme Absolute Truth can be
a person. Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas, the souls who have already realized the Absolute
Truth, one may understand Krsna, who exactly resembles a human being (narakrti). This human form
was explained by Krsna Himself after He manifested the virat-rupa. The virat-rupa is not the original form
of the Lord; the Lord's original form is Dvibhuja-syamasundara, Muralidhara, the Lord with two hands,
playing a flute (yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam). The Lord's forms are proof of His
inconceivable qualities. Although the Lord maintains innumerable universes within the period of His
breath, He is dressed with a form exactly like that of a human being. That does not mean, however, that
He is a human being. This is His original form, but because He looks like a human being, those with a
poor fund of knowledge consider Him an ordinary man. The Lord says:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and
My supreme dominion over all that be." (Bg. 9.11) By the Lord's param bhavam, or transcendental nature,
He is the all-pervading Paramatma living in the core of the hearts of all living entities, yet He looks like a
human being. Mayavada philosophy says that the Lord is originally impersonal but assumes a human
form and many other forms when He descends. Actually, however, He is originally like a human being,
and the impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti).

O Maharaja Pariksit, because Yadu, Madhu and Vrsni each inaugurated a dynasty, their dynasties are
known as Yadava, Madhava and Vrsni. The son of Yadu named Krosta had a son named Vrjinavan. The
son of Vrjinavan was Svahita; the son of Svahita, Visadgu; the son of Visadgu, Citraratha; and the son of
Citraratha, Sasabindu. The greatly fortunate Sasabindu, who was a great mystic, possessed fourteen
opulences and was the owner of fourteen great jewels. Thus he became the emperor of the world.
In the Markandeya Purana the fourteen kinds of great jewels are described as follows: (1) an elephant,
(2) a horse, (3) a chariot, (4) a wife, (5) arrows, (6) a reservoir of wealth, (7) a garland, (8) valuable
costumes, (9) trees, (10) a spear, (11) a noose, (12) jewels, (13) an umbrella, and (14) regulative
principles. To be the emperor, one must possess all fourteen of these opulences. Sasabindu possessed
them all.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Ninth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Srimad-

Chapter Twenty-four
Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Vidarbha had three sons, named Kusa, Kratha and Romapada. Of these three, Romapada expanded his
dynasty by the sons and grandsons named Babhru, Krti, Usika, Cedi and Caidya, all of whom later became
kings. From the son of Vidarbha named Kratha came a son named Kunti, from whose dynasty came the
descendants named Vrsni, Nirvrti, Dasarha, Vyoma, Jimuta, Vikrti, Bhimaratha, Navaratha, Dasaratha,
Sakuni, Karambhi, Devarata, Devaksatra, Madhu, Kuruvasa, Anu, Puruhotra, Ayu and Satvata. Satvata had
seven sons. One of them was Devavrdha, whose son was Babhru. Another son of Satvata was Mahabhoja,
by whom the Bhoja dynasty was inaugurated. Another was Vrsni, who had a son named Yudhajit. From
Yudhajit came Anamitra and Sini, and from Anamitra came Nighna and another Sini. The descendants in
succession from Sini were Satyaka, Yuyudhana, Jaya, Kuni and Yugandhara. Another son of Anamitra was
Vrsni. From Vrsni came Svaphalka, by whom Akrura and twelve other sons were generated. From Akrura
came two sons, named Devavan and Upadeva. The son of Andhaka named Kukura was the origin of the
descendants known as Vahni, Viloma, Kapotaroma, Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Avidyota, Punarvasu and
Ahuka. Ahuka had two sons, named Devaka and Ugrasena. The four sons of Devaka were known as
Devavan, Upadeva, Sudeva and Devavardhana, and his seven daughters were Dhrtadeva, Santideva,
Upadeva, Srideva, Devaraksita, Sahadeva and Devaki. Vasudeva married all seven daughters of Devaka.
Ugrasena had nine sons named Kamsa, Sunama, Nyagrodha, Kanka, Sanku, Suhu, Rastrapala, Dhrsti and
Tustiman, and he had five daughters named Kamsa, Kamsavati, Kanka, Surabhu and Rastrapalika. The
younger brothers of Vasudeva married all the daughters of Ugrasena.
Viduratha, the son of Citraratha, had a son named Sura, who had ten other sons, of whom Vasudeva was
the chief. Sura gave one of his five daughters, Prtha, to his friend Kunti, and therefore she was also named
Kunti. In her maiden state she gave birth to a child named Karna, and later she married Maharaja Pandu.
Vrddhasarma married the daughter of Sura named Srutadeva, from whose womb Dantavakra was born.
Dhrstaketu married Sura's daughter named Srutakirti, who had five sons. Jayasena married Sura's
daughter named Rajadhidevi. The king of Cedi-desa, Damaghosa, married the daughter of Sura named
Srutasrava, from whom Sisupala was born.
Devabhaga, through the womb of Kamsa, begot Citraketu and Brhadbala; and Devasrava, through the
womb of Kamsavati, begot Suvira and Isuman. From Kanka, through the womb of Kanka, came Baka,
Satyajit and Purujit, and from Srnjaya, through the womb of Rastrapalika, came Vrsa and Durmarsana.
Syamaka, through the womb of Surabhumi, begot Harikesa and Hiranyaksa. Vatsaka, through the womb
of Misrakesi, begot Vrka, who begot the sons named Taksa, Puskara and Sala. From Samika came Sumitra
and Arjunapala, and from Anaka came Rtadhama and Jaya.
Vasudeva had many wives, of whom Devaki and Rohini were the most important. From the womb of
Rohini, Baladeva was born, along with Gada, Sarana, Durmada, Vipula, Dhruva, Krta and others.
Vasudeva had many other sons by his other wives, and the eighth son to appear from the womb of Devaki
was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivered the entire world from the burden of demons.

Through Marisa, King Sura begot Vasudeva, Devabhaga, Devasrava, Anaka, Srnjaya, Syamaka, Kanka,

the demigods from the heavenly kingdom sounded kettledrums. Therefore Vasudeva, who provided the
proper place for the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, was also known as
Anakadundubhi. The five daughters of King Sura, named Prtha, Srutadeva, Srutakirti, Srutasrava and
Rajadhidevi, were Vasudeva's sisters. Sura gave Prtha to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore
another name of Prtha was Kunti.

The sun-god said: O beautiful Prtha, your meeting with the demigods cannot be fruitless. Therefore, let
me place my seed in your womb so that you may bear a son. I shall arrange to keep your virginity intact,
since you are still an unmarried girl.
According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before she is married, no one will marry
her. Therefore although the sun-god, after appearing before Prtha, wanted to give her a child, Prtha
hesitated because she was still unmarried. To keep her virginity undisturbed, the sun-god arranged to give
her a child that came from her ear, and therefore the child was known as Karna. The custom is that a girl
should be married aksata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed. A girl should never bear a child
before her marriage.

The eight sons born of Sahadeva such as Pravara and Sruta, were exact incarnations of the eight Vasus in

included Kirtiman, Susena, Bhadrasena, Rju, Sammardana, Bhadra and Sankarsana, the controller and
serpent incarnation. The eighth son was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself--Krsna. The highly
fortunate Subhadra, the one daughter, was your grandmother.
The fifty-fifth verse says, svayam eva harih kila, indicating that Krsna, the eighth son of Devaki, is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna is not an incarnation. Although there is no difference between the
Supreme Personality of Godhead Hari and His incarnation, Krsna is the original Supreme Person, the
complete Godhead. Incarnations exhibit only a certain percentage of the potencies of Godhead; the
complete Godhead is Krsna Himself, who appeared as the eighth son of Devaki.

Whenever the principles of religion deteriorate and the principles of irreligion increase, the supreme
controller, the Personality of Godhead Sri Hari, appears by His own will.
The principles by which an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends upon earth are
explained in this verse. The same principles are also explained in Bhagavad-gita (4.7) by the Lord Himself:
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself."
In the present age, the Supreme Personality of Godhead has appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to
inaugurate the Hare Krsna movement. At the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and
bad (manda). They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form to live
like cats and dogs. Under these circumstances Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has inaugurated the Hare Krsna
movement, which is not different from Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one associates with
this movement, he directly associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People should take
advantage of the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra and thus gain relief from all the problems created in
this age of Kali.

O King, Maharaja Pariksit, but for the Lord's personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance,
disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul, He knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that
affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.
This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living
being. An ordinary living being receives a particular type of body according to his past activities (karmana
daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye). A living being is never independent and can never appear
independently. Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed upon him by maya according to his past
karma. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), yantrarudhani mayaya. The body is a kind of machine
created and offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body awarded to him
by maya, the material energy, according to his karma. One cannot independently say, "Give me a body
like this" or "Give me a body like that." One must accept whatever body is offered by the material energy.
This is the position of the ordinary living being.
When Krsna descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion for the fallen souls. As the
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion,
I advent Myself millennium after millennium." The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear. Indeed, no one
can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everyone is under His control,
and He is not under the control of anyone else. Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge
think that one can equal Krsna or become Krsna are condemned in every way. No one can equal or
surpass Krsna, who is therefore described as asamaurdhva. According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the
word maya is used in the sense of "false pride" and also in the sense of "compassion." For an ordinary
living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14),
daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: "This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes
of material nature, is difficult to overcome." But when Krsna comes the word maya refers to His
compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls. By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone,
whether sinful or pious.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material energy in the creation, maintenance and
annihilation of this cosmic manifestation just to deliver the living entity by His compassion and stop the
living entity's birth, death and duration of materialistic life. Thus He enables the living being to return
home, back to Godhead.
Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world for the suffering of the living
entities. The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." All the living entities are part
and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but
quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living
entities are limited. Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a
limited pleasure potency. Anandamayo 'bhyasat (Vedanta-sutra 1.1.12). Both the Lord and the living
entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Krsna, he is put
into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahma and is gradually degraded to the status of an
ant or a worm in stool. This is called manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati. There is a great
struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature's full
control (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah). Because of his limited knowledge, however, the
living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world. Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati.
He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (ahankaravimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate). Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to
merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues.
Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adhah (Bhag. 10.2.32). Even having attained that param
padam, having merged into the impersonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world.
In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in this material world, and
therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears in this world and instructs him. Thus the Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." The real dharma is to surrender unto Krsna,
but the rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to Krsna, engages in adharma, in a struggle for
existence to become like Krsna. Therefore out of compassion Krsna creates this material world to give the
living entity a chance to understand his real position. Bhagavad-gita and similar Vedic literatures are
presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with Krsna. Vedais ca sarvair aham eva
vedyah (Bg. 15.15). All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what
he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This is called brahma-jijnasa. Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best
chance for him to understand his position. Therefore this verse says, anugrahas tan-nivrtteh, indicating
that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be
educated. This is the purpose of the creation.
The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think.
asatyam apratistham te
jagad ahur anisvaram
aparaspara-sambhutam
kim anyat kama-haitukam
"They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is
produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust." (Bg. 16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no
God and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance and the
woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child. Actually, however, this is not the fact. The fact is that
there is a purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original
consciousness, Krsna consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in
the spiritual world. In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but
at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place for
happiness. Janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam (Bg. 13.9). One must stop the repetition of
birth and death. Every human being, therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding
Krsna and his relationship with Krsna and in this way return home, back to Godhead.

aksauhininam patibhir
asurair nrpa-lanchanaih
bhuva akramyamanaya
abharaya krtodyamah
aksauhininam--of kings possessing great military power; patibhih--by such kings or government;
asuraih--actually demons (because they do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily);
nrpa-lanchanaih--who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have somehow taken possession of the
government); bhuvah--on the surface of the earth; akramyamanayah--aiming at attacking one another;
abharaya--paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on the surface of the earth; krtaudyamah--
enthusiastic (they spend all the revenue of the state to increase military power).
Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they
do not know the duty of the government. Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who
possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the
surface of the earth is reduced. The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so
that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Krsna
consciousness.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam. The sadhus, the devotees
of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Krsna consciousness so that the conditioned souls
may be released from the bondage of birth and death. But the asuras, the demons, impede the
advancement of the Krsna consciousness movement, and therefore Krsna arranges occasional fights
between different asuras who are very much interested in increasing their military power. The duty of the
government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to
see that the people of the state advance in Krsna consciousness. For this purpose, Krsna says in Bhagavadgita
(4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to the three modes of
material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me."
There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide brahmanas, and they should be given all
protection. Namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca. Krsna is very fond of brahmanas and cows,
The brahmanas promulgate the cause of advancement in Krsna consciousness, and the cows give enough
milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness. The ksatriyas and the government should be advised
by the brahmanas. Next, the vaisyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the sudras, who cannot do
anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas). This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls
will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead. This is the purpose of
Krsna's descent on the surface of the earth (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam).
Everyone must understand Krsna's activities (janma karma ca me divyam). If one understands the
purpose of Krsna's coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated. This
liberation is the purpose of the creation and Krsna's descent upon the surface of the earth. Demons are
very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but
Krsna's devotees want to teach Krsna consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and
Krsna conscious advancement. Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so
that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization. Such endeavors
are jagato'hitah; that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general. Ksayaya: such activities
lead to annihilation. One who understands the purpose of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
should seriously understand the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement and seriously take part
in it. One should not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense gratification. Nunam
pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti (Bhag. 5.5.4). Simply for sense gratification, people
make plans for material happiness. Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag. 7.9.43). They do
this because they are all vimudhas, rascals. For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy,
not understanding the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple
devotees of brainwashing. Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Krsna consciousness
movement, but Krsna will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be
engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.

karmany aparimeyani

karmani--activities; aparimeyani--immeasurable, unlimited; manasa api--even by such plans perceived
within the mind; sura-isvaraih--by the controllers of the universe like Brahma and Siva; sahasankarsanah--
along with Sankarsana (Baladeva); cakre--performed; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; madhu-sudanah--the killer of the Madhu demon.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, with the cooperation of Sankarsana, Balarama, performed
activities beyond the mental comprehension of even such personalities as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva.
[For instance, Krsna arranged the Battle of Kuruksetra to kill many demons for the relief of the entire
world.]

kalau janisyamananam
duhkha-soka-tamo-nudam
anugrahaya bhaktanam
supunyam vyatanod yasah
kalau--in this age of Kali; janisyamananam--of the conditioned souls who will take birth in the future;
duhkha-soka-tamah-nudam--to minimize their unlimited unhappiness and lamentation, which are caused
by ignorance; anugrahaya--just to show mercy; bhaktanam--to the devotees; su-punyam--very pious,
transcendental activities; vyatanot--expanded; yasah--His glories or reputation.
To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future in this age of Kali, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him one will be
freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of material existence. [In other words, He acted so that all
future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Krsna consciousness stated in Bhagavad-gita, could be
relieved from the pangs of material existence.]
The Lord's activities of saving the devotees and killing the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca
duskrtam) take place side by side. Krsna actually appears for the deliverance of the sadhus, or bhaktas,
but by killing the demons He shows them mercy also, for anyone killed by Krsna is liberated. Whether the
Lord kills or gives protection, He is kind to both the demons and the devotees.

yasmin sat-karna-piyuse
yasas-tirtha-vare sakrt
srotranjalir upasprsya
dhunute karma-vasanam
yasmin--in the history of the transcendental activities of Krsna upon the surface of the earth; sat-karnapiyuse--
who pleases the demands of the transcendental, purified ears; yasah-tirtha-vare--keeping oneself
in the best of holy places by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord; sakrt--once only,
immediately; srotra-anjalih--in the form of hearing the transcendental message; upasprsya--touching
(exactly like the water of the Ganges); dhunute--destroys; karma-vasanam--the strong desire for fruitive
activities.
Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the
Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.
When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they
are no longer interested in materialistic activities. Thus they achieve freedom from the material world. For
sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of
janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi--birth, death, old age and disease--but the devotee, simply by hearing the
message of Bhagavad-gita and further relishing the narrations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, becomes so pure
that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities. At the moment, devotees in the Western
countries are being attracted by Krsna consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities,
and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement. But they cannot possibly check this movement
or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions. Here the words
srotranjalir upasprsya indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the
devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive
activities. Anyabhilasita-sunyam Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the
devotees are freed from such activities. The devotees are situated in liberation (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate),
and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.

society; ramayam asa--pleased; murtya--by His personal form; sarva-anga-ramyaya--the form that pleases
everyone by all parts of the body.
Assisted by the descendants of Bhoja, Vrsni, Andhaka, Madhu, Surasena, Dasarha, Kuru, Srnjaya and
Pandu, Lord Krsna performed various activities. By His pleasing smiles, His affectionate behavior, His
instructions and His uncommon pastimes like raising Govardhana Hill, the Lord, appearing in His
transcendental body, pleased all of human society.
The words nrlokam ramayam asa murtya sarvanga-ramyaya are significant. Krsna is the original form.
Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is therefore described here by the word murtya. The word
murti means "form." Krsna, or God, is never impersonal; the impersonal feature is but a manifestation of
His transcendental body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti). The Lord is narakrti, exactly
resembling the form of a human being, but His form is different from ours. Therefore the word sarvangaramyaya
informs us that every part of His body is pleasing for everyone to see. Apart from His smiling
face, every part of His body--His hands, His legs, His chest--is pleasing to the devotees, who cannot at any
time stop seeing the beautiful form of the Lord.

Krsna's face is decorated with ornaments, such as earrings resembling sharks. His ears are beautiful, His
cheeks brilliant, and His smiling attractive to everyone. Whoever sees Lord Krsna sees a festival. His face
and body are fully satisfying for everyone to see, but the devotees are angry at the creator for the
disturbance caused by the momentary blinking of their eyes.
As stated by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita (7.3):
manusyanam sahasresu
kascid yatati siddhaye
yatatam api siddhanam
kascin mam vetti tattvatah
"Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved
perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth." Unless one is qualified to understand Krsna, one cannot
appreciate the presence of Krsna on earth. Among the Bhojas, Vrsnis, Andhakas, Pandavas and many
other kings intimately related with Krsna, the intimate relationship between Krsna and the inhabitants of
Vrndavana is especially to be noted. That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavam
na tatrpur drsibhih pibantyah. The inhabitants of Vrndavana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the
cows, the calves, the gopis and Krsna's father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw
Krsna's beautiful features constantly. Seeing Krsna is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival. The
inhabitants of Vrndavana saw Krsna almost every moment, but when Krsna left the village for the
pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gopis were very much afflicted because they
saw Krsna walking on the sand and thought that Krsna's lotus feet, which they dared not place on their
breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone.
By even thinking of this, the gopis were affected, and they cried at home. These gopis, who were therefore
the exalted friends of Krsna, saw Krsna constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of
Krsna, the gopis condemned the creator, Lord Brahma. Therefore the beauty of Krsna, especially the
beauty of His face, is described here. At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we
find a hint of Krsna's beauty. Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Krsna's
head. The entire Srimad-Bhagavata purana is the embodiment of Krsna's form, and the Tenth Canto is His
face. This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is. Krsna's smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips,
the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts--all this was minutely observed by the gopis, who
thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Krsna's face, but
instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision. The beauty of
Krsna's face was therefore much more appreciated by the gopis than by His friends the cowherd boys or
even by Yasoda Mata, who was also interested in decorating the face of Krsna.

jatah--after taking birth as the son of Vasudeva; gatah--went away; pitr-grhat--from the houses of His
father; vrajam--to Vrndavana; edhita-arthah--to exalt the position (of Vrndavana); hatva--killing there;
ripun--many demons; suta-satani--hundreds of sons; krta-urudarah--accepting many thousands of wives,
the best of women; utpadya--begot; tesu--in them; purusah--the Supreme Person, who exactly resembles a
human being; kratubhih--by many sacrifices; samije--worshiped; atmanam--Himself (because He is the
person worshiped by all sacrifices); atma-nigamam--exactly according to the ritualistic ceremonies of the
Vedas; prathayan--expanding the Vedic principles; janesu--among the people in general.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-purusottama, appeared as the son of
Vasudeva but immediately left His father's home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving relationship
with His confidential devotees. In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned
to Dvaraka, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women,
begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the
principles of householder life.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: by all the Vedas, it is Krsna who
is to be known. Lord Sri Krsna, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic
ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of grhastha life by marrying many wives
and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic
principles. The center of Vedic sacrifice is Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). To advance in
human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Krsna in
His householder life. The real purpose of Krsna's appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take
part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy
are possible only in Vrndavana. Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord
immediately left for Vrndavana. In Vrndavana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father
and mother, the gopis and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in order to
protect the devotees and kill the demons. This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior. In Bhagavadgita
the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be purusam sasvatam divyam--the eternal, transcendental
Supreme Person. Here also we find the words utpadya tesu purusah. Therefore it is to be concluded that
the Absolute Truth is purusa, a person. The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His
personality. Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal. And not only is He purusa, a person, but He
is the lila-purusottama, the best of all persons.

Thereafter, Lord Sri Krsna created a misunderstanding between family members just to diminish the

Kuruksetra and declared victory for Arjuna. Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and
devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.
paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam. The mission of Lord Krsna was performed on the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra, for by the Lord's mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee
whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord's glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and
enabled them to attain sarupya. Finally, Lord Krsna instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of
devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode. The Lord's instructions in
the form of Bhagavad-gita are full of jnana and vairagya, knowledge and renunciation. In the human form
of life, one must learn these two things--how to become detached from the material world and how to
acquire full knowledge in spiritual life. This is the Lord's mission (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca
duskrtam). After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Vrndavana.

Bhagavatam, entitled "Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead"
