<h2>Text</h2>
tapyamanam tri-bhuvanam
pranayamaidhasagnina
nirgatena muner murdhnah
samiksya prabhavas trayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tapyamanam--while practicing austerities; tri-bhuvanam--the three worlds; pranayama--practice by
breathing exercise; edhasa--fuel; agnina--by the fire; nirgatena--issuing out; muneh--of the great sage;
murdhnah--the top of the head; samiksya--looking over; prabhavah trayah--the three great gods (Brahma,
Visnu and Mahesvara).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Atri Muni was engaged in these severe austerities, a blazing fire came out of his head by virtue of
his breathing exercise, and that fire was seen by the three principal deities of the three worlds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the fire of pranayama is mental satisfaction. That fire was perceived by
the Supersoul, Visnu, and thereby Lord Brahma and Siva also perceived it. Atri Muni, by his breathing
exercise, concentrated on the Supersoul, or the Lord of the universe. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, the
Lord of the universe is Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti), and, by the direction of Vasudeva, Lord Brahma
and Lord Siva work. Therefore, on the direction of Vasudeva, both Lord Brahma and Lord Siva perceived
the severe penance adopted by Atri Muni, and thus they were pleased to come down, as stated in the next
verse.
