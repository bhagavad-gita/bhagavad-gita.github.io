<h2>Translation</h2>
Whoever, with great reverence and adoration, regularly reads, chants and describes the history of
Maharaja Prthu's activities will certainly increase unflinching faith and attraction for the lotus feet of the
Lord. The Lord's lotus feet are the boat by which one can cross the ocean of nescience.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word bhava-sindhu-pota-pade is significant in this verse. The lotus feet of the Lord are known as
mahat-padam; this means that the total source of material existence rests on the lotus feet of the Lord. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavah: everything is emanating from Him. This cosmic
manifestation, which is compared to an ocean of nescience, is also resting on the lotus feet of the Lord. As
such, this great ocean of nescience is minimized by a person who is a pure devotee. One who has taken
shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord need not cross over the ocean, for he has already crossed it by virtue of
his position at the Lord's lotus feet. By hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord or the Lord's
devotee, one can become firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. This position can also be
achieved very easily by narrating the history of the life of Prthu Maharaja regularly every day. The word
vimukta-sangah is also significant in this connection. Because we associate with the three qualities of
material nature, our position in this material world is full of dangers, but when we engage in the
devotional service of the Lord by the process of sravanam and kirtanam, we immediately become vimuktasanga,
or liberated.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Maharaja Prthu's Going Back Home."
Chapter Twenty-four
