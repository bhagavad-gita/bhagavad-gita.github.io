TRANSLATION
The daughter of King Vidarbha wore old garments, and she was lean and thin because of her vows of
austerity. Since she did not arrange her hair, it became entangled and twisted in locks. Although she
remained always near her husband, she was as silent and unagitated as the flame of an undisturbed fire.
PURPORT
When one begins to burn firewood, there is smoke and agitation in the beginning. Although there are so
many disturbances in the beginning, once the fire is completely set, the firewood burns steadily. Similarly,
when both husband and wife follow the regulative principles of austerity, they remain silent and are not
agitated by sex impulses. At such a time both husband and wife are benefited spiritually. One can attain
this stage of life by completely giving up a luxurious mode of life.
In this verse the word cira-vasa refers to very old torn garments. The wife especially should remain
austere, not desiring luxurious dresses and living standards. She should accept only the bare necessities of
life and minimize her eating and sleeping. There should be no question of mating. Simply by engaging in
the service of her exalted husband, who must be a pure devotee, the wife will never be agitated by sex
impulses. The vanaprastha stage is exactly like this. Although the wife remains with the husband, she
undergoes severe austerities and penances so that although both husband and wife live together, there is
no question of sex. In this way both husband and wife can live together perpetually. Since the wife is
weaker than the husband, this weakness is expressed in this verse with the words upa patim. Upa means
"near to," or "almost equal to." Being a man, the husband is generally more advanced than his wife.
Nonetheless, the wife is expected to give up all luxurious habits. She should not even dress nicely or
comb her hair. Hair combing is one of the main businesses of women. In the vanaprastha stage the wife
should not take care of her hair. Thus her hair will become tangled in knots. Consequently the wife will
no longer be attractive to the husband, and she herself will no longer be agitated by sex impulses. In this
way both husband and wife can advance in spiritual consciousness. This advanced stage is called the
paramahamsa stage, and once it is obtained, both husband and wife can be actually liberated from bodily
consciousness. If the disciple remains steady in the service of the spiritual master, he need no longer fear
falling down into the clutches of maya.
