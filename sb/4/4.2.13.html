<h2>Text</h2>
lupta-kriyayasucaye
manine bhinna-setave
anicchann apy adam balam
sudrayevosatim giram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
lupta-kriyaya--not observing rules and regulations; asucaye--impure; manine--proud; bhinna-setave--
having broken all rules of civility; anicchan--not desiring; api--although; adam--handed over; balam--my
daughter; sudraya--unto a sudra; iva--as; usatim giram--the message of the Vedas.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I had no desire to give my daughter to this person, who has broken all rules of civility. Because of not
observing the required rules and regulations, he is impure, but I was obliged to hand over my daughter to
him just as one teaches the messages of the Vedas to a sudra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A sudra is forbidden to take lessons from the Vedas because a sudra, due to his unclean habits, is not
worthy to hear such instructions. This restriction, that unless one has acquired the brahminical
qualifications one should not read the Vedic literatures, is like the restriction that a law student should
not enter a law college unless he has been graduated from all lower grades. According to the estimation of
Daksa, Siva was unclean in habits and not worthy to have the hand of his daughter, Sati, who was so
enlightened, beautiful and chaste. The word used in this connection is bhinna-setave, which refers to one
who has broken all the regulations for good behavior by not following the Vedic principles. ln other
words, according to Daksa the entire transaction of the marriage of his daughter with Siva was not in
order.
