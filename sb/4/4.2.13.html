lupta-kriyayasucaye
manine bhinna-setave
anicchann apy adam balam
sudrayevosatim giram
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
lupta-kriyaya--not observing rules and regulations; asucaye--impure; manine--proud; bhinna-setave--
having broken all rules of civility; anicchan--not desiring; api--although; adam--handed over; balam--my
daughter; sudraya--unto a sudra; iva--as; usatim giram--the message of the Vedas.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I had no desire to give my daughter to this person, who has broken all rules of civility. Because of not
observing the required rules and regulations, he is impure, but I was obliged to hand over my daughter to
him just as one teaches the messages of the Vedas to a sudra.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A sudra is forbidden to take lessons from the Vedas because a sudra, due to his unclean habits, is not
worthy to hear such instructions. This restriction, that unless one has acquired the brahminical
qualifications one should not read the Vedic literatures, is like the restriction that a law student should
not enter a law college unless he has been graduated from all lower grades. According to the estimation of
Daksa, Siva was unclean in habits and not worthy to have the hand of his daughter, Sati, who was so
enlightened, beautiful and chaste. The word used in this connection is bhinna-setave, which refers to one
who has broken all the regulations for good behavior by not following the Vedic principles. ln other
words, according to Daksa the entire transaction of the marriage of his daughter with Siva was not in
order.

by the Bhutas; vrtah--accompanied by; atati--he wanders; unmatta-vat--like a madman; nagnah--

crazy beings; patih--the leader; pramatha-nathanam--of the lords of the Pramathas; tamah-matra-atmakaatmanam--
of those grossly in the mode of ignorance.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He lives in filthy places like crematoriums, and his companions are the ghosts and demons. Naked like a
madman, sometimes laughing and sometimes crying, he smears crematorium ashes all over his body. He
does not bathe regularly, and he ornaments his body with a garland of skulls and bones. Therefore only in
name is he Siva, or auspicious; actually, he is the most mad and inauspicious creature. Thus he is very
dear to crazy beings in the gross mode of ignorance, and he is their leader.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Those who do not regularly bathe are supposed to be in association with ghosts and crazy creatures.
Lord Siva appeared to be like that, but his name, Siva, is actually fitting, for he is very kind to persons
who are in the darkness of the mode of ignorance, such as unclean drunkards who do not regularly bathe.
Lord Siva is so kind that he gives shelter to such creatures and gradually elevates them to spiritual
consciousness. Although it is very difficult to raise such creatures to spiritual understanding, Lord Siva
takes charge of them, and therefore, as stated in the Vedas, Lord Siva is all-auspicious. Thus by his
association even such fallen souls can be elevated. Sometimes it is seen that great personalities meet with
fallen souls, not for any personal interest but for the benefit of those souls. In the creation of the Lord
there are different kinds of living creatures. Some of them are in the mode of goodness, some are in the
mode of passion, and some are in the mode of ignorance. Lord Visnu takes charge of persons who are
advanced Krsna conscious Vaisnavas, and Lord Brahma takes charge of persons who are very much
attached to material activities, but Lord Siva is so kind that he takes charge of persons who are in gross
ignorance and whose behavior is lower that that of the animals. Therefore Lord Siva is especially called
auspicious.
