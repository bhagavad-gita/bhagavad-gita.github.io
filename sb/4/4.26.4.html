<h2>Translation</h2>
When the living entity wants to enjoy the modes of material nature in their totality, he prefers, out of
many bodily forms, to accept that body which has nine gates, two hands and two legs. Thus he prefers to
become a human being or a demigod.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is a very nice explanation of how the spiritual being, the part and parcel of Krsna, God, accepts a
material body by virtue of his own desires. Accepting two hands, two legs, and so on, the living entity
fully enjoys the modes of material nature. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.27):
iccha-dvesa-samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhutani sammoham
sarge yanti parantapa
"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome
by the dualities of desire and hate."
Originally the living entity is a spiritual being, but when he actually desires to enjoy this material world,
he comes down. From this verse we can understand that the living entity first accepts a body that is
human in form, but gradually, due to his degraded activities, he falls into lower forms of life--into the
animal, plant and aquatic forms. By the gradual process of evolution, the living entity again attains the
body of a human being and is given another chance to get out of the process of transmigration. If he again
misses his chance in the human form to understand his position, he is again placed in the cycle of birth
and death in various types of bodies.
The desire of the living entity to come into the material world is not very difficult to understand.
Although one may be born in a family of Aryans, where there are restrictions against meat-eating,
intoxication, gambling and illicit sex, still one may want to enjoy these forbidden things. There is always
someone who wants to go to a prostitute for illicit sex or to a hotel to eat meat and drink wine. There is
always someone who wants to gamble at nightclubs or enjoy so-called sports. All these propensities are
already within the hearts of the living entities, but some living entities stop to enjoy these abominable
activities and consequently fall down to a degraded platform. The more one desires a degraded life within
his heart, the more he falls down to occupy different forms of abominable existence. This is the process of
transmigration and evolution. A particular type of animal may have a strong tendency to enjoy one kind
of sense enjoyment, but in the human form one can enjoy all the senses. The human form has the facility
to utilize all the senses for gratification. Unless one is properly trained, he becomes a victim of the modes
of material nature, as confirmed by Bhagavad-gita (3.27):
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." As soon as one desires to enjoy his
senses, he puts himself under the control of material energy and automatically, or mechanically, is placed
into the cycle of birth and death in various life-forms.
