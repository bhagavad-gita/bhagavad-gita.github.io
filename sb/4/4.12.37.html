TRANSLATION
Persons who are peaceful, equipoised, cleansed and purified, and who know the art of pleasing all other
living entities, keep friendship only with devotees of the Lord; they alone can very easily achieve the
perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.
PURPORT
The description of this verse fully indicates that only devotees are eligible to enter into the kingdom of
Godhead. The first point stated is that devotees are peaceful, for they have no demands for their personal
sense gratification. They are simply dedicated to the service of the Lord. Karmis cannot be peaceful
because they have immense demands for sense gratification. As for jnanis, they cannot be peaceful
because they are too busy trying to attain liberation or merge into the existence of the Supreme. Similarly,
yogis are also restless to get mystic power. But a devotee is peaceful because he is fully surrendered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and thinks of himself as completely helpless; just as a child feels
complete peace in depending on the parent, so a devotee is completely peaceful, for he depends on the
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
A devotee is equipoised. He sees everyone on the same transcendental platform. A devotee knows that
although a conditioned soul has a particular type of body according to his past fruitive activities, factually
everyone is part of the Supreme Lord. A devotee sees all living entities with spiritual vision and does not
discriminate on the platform of the bodily concept of life. Such qualities develop only in the association of
devotees. Without the association of devotees, one cannot advance in Krsna consciousness. Therefore, we
have established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Factually, whoever lives in this
society automatically develops Krsna consciousness. Devotees are dear to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is only dear to devotees. On this platform only can
one make progress in Krsna consciousness. Persons in Krsna consciousness, or devotees of the Lord, can
please everyone, as is evident in the Krsna consciousness movement. We invite everyone, without
discrimination; we request everyone to sit down and chant the Hare Krsna mantra and take as much
prasada as we can supply, and thus everyone is pleased with us. This is the qualification. Sarvabhutanuranjanah.
As for purification, no one can be more pure than devotees. Anyone who once utters
the name of Visnu immediately becomes purified, inside and outside (yah smaret pundarikaksam). Since a
devotee constantly chants the Hare Krsna mantra, no contamination of the material world can touch him.
He is, therefore, actually purified. Muci haya suci haya yadi krsna bhaje. It is said that even a cobbler or
person born in the family of a cobbler can be elevated to the position of a brahmana (suci) if he takes to
Krsna consciousness. Any person who is purely Krsna conscious and who engages in chanting the Hare
Krsna mantra is the purest in the whole universe.
