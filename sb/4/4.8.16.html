<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, in Your impersonal manifestation of Brahman there are always two opposing elements--
knowledge and ignorance. Your multienergies are continually manifest, but the impersonal Brahman,
which is undivided, original, changeless, unlimited and blissful, is the cause of the material manifestation.
Because You are the same impersonal Brahman, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Brahma-samhita it is said that the unlimited impersonal Brahman is the effulgence of the
transcendental body of Govinda. In that unlimited effulgent aura of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
there are innumerable universes with innumerable planets of different categories. Although the Supreme
Person is the original cause of all causes, His impersonal effulgence, known as Brahman, is the immediate
cause of the material manifestation. Dhruva Maharaja, therefore, offered his respectful obeisances unto the
impersonal feature of the Lord. One who realizes this impersonal feature can enjoy the unchangeable
brahmananda, described here as spiritual bliss.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes that this impersonal feature, or Brahman manifestation,
of the Supreme Lord is meant for persons who are essentially very advanced but still not able to
understand the personal features or variegatedness of the spiritual world. Such devotees are known as
jnana-misra-bhaktas, or devotees whose devotional service is mixed with empiric knowledge. Because the
impersonal Brahman realization is a partial understanding of the Absolute Truth, Dhruva Maharaja offers
his respectful obeisances.
It is said that this impersonal Brahman is the distant realization of the Absolute Truth. Although
apparently Brahman seems to be devoid of energy, factually it has different energies working under the
headings of knowledge and ignorance. On account of these different energies, there is continually a
manifestation of vidya and avidya. Vidya and avidya are very nicely described in Isopanisad. It is said
there that sometimes, due to avidya, or a poor fund of knowledge, one accepts the Absolute Truth as
ultimately impersonal. But in fact the impersonal and personal realizations develop in proportion to the
development of devotional service. The more we develop our devotional service, the more closely we
approach the Absolute Truth, which, in the beginning, when we realize the Absolute Truth from a distant
place, is manifest as impersonal.
People in general, who are under the influence of avidya-sakti, or maya, have neither knowledge nor
devotion. But when a person who is a little advanced and is therefore called a jnani advances even more,
he is in the category of a jnana-misra-bhakta, or a devotee whose love is mixed with empiric knowledge.
When he is still further advanced, he can realize that the Absolute Truth is a person with multienergies.
An advanced devotee can understand the Lord and His creative energy. As soon as one accepts the
creative energy of the Absolute Truth, the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are also
understood. Devotees who are still further advanced, in full knowledge, can understand the
transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Only on that platform can one fully enjoy transcendental bliss. An
example is given in this connection by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura of a person proceeding towards a
destination. As he approaches, he sees the destination from a distant place, just as we see a city from a
distance. At that time he simply understands that the city is situated at a distance. When, however, he
comes still nearer, he sees the domes and flags. But as soon as he enters the city, he sees various paths,
gardens, lakes, and marketplaces with shops, and persons buying. He sees varieties of cinema houses, and
he sees dancing and jubilation. When a person actually enters the city and personally sees the activities of
the city, he becomes satisfied.
