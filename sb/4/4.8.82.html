<h2>Text</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca
ma bhaista balam tapaso duratyayan
nivartayisye pratiyata sva-dhama
yato hi vah prana-nirodha asid
auttanapadir mayi sangatatma
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead replied; ma bhaista--do not be afraid; balam--
the boy Dhruva; tapasah--by his severe austerity; duratyayat--strongly determined; nivartayisye--I shall
ask him to stop this; pratiyata--you can return; sva-dhama--your own respective homes; yatah--from
whom; hi--certainly; vah--your; prana-nirodhah--choking the life air; asit--happened; auttanapadih--on
account of the son of King Uttanapada; mayi--unto Me; sangata-atma--fully absorbed in thought of Me.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead replied: My dear demigods, do not be perturbed by this. It is due
to the severe austerity and full determination of the son of King Uttanapada, who is now fully absorbed in
thought of Me. He has obstructed the universal breathing process. You can safely return to your respective
homes. I shall stop this boy in his severe acts of austerities, and you will be saved from this situation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here one word, sangatatma, is misinterpreted by the Mayavadi philosophers, who say that the self of
Dhruva Maharaja became one with the Supreme Self, the Personality of Godhead. The Mayavadi
philosophers want to prove by this word that the Supersoul and the individual soul become united in this
way and that after such unification the individual soul has no separate existence. But here it is clearly said
by the Supreme Lord that Dhruva Maharaja was so absorbed in meditation on the thought of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead that He Himself, the universal consciousness, was attracted to Dhruva. In order to
please the demigods, He wanted to go Himself to Dhruva Maharaja to stop him from this severe austerity.
The Mayavadi philosophers' conclusion that the Supersoul and the individual soul become united is not
supported by this statement. Rather, the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, wanted to stop Dhruva
Maharaja from this severe austerity.
By pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one pleases everyone, just as by watering the root of a
tree one satisfies every branch, twig and leaf of the tree. lf one can attract the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one naturally attracts the whole universe because Krsna is the supreme cause of the universe.
All the demigods were afraid of being totally vanquished by suffocation, but the Personality of Godhead
assured them that Dhruva Maharaja was a great devotee of the Lord and was not about to annihilate
everyone in the universe. A devotee is never envious of other living entities.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Dhruva Maharaja Leaves Home for the Forest."
Chapter Nine
Dhruva Maharaja Returns Home
