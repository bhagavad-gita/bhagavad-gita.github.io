<h2>Text</h2>
atmanam indriyartham ca
param yad ubhayor api
saty asaya upadhau vai
puman pasyati nanyada
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atmanam--the soul; indriya-artham--for sense gratification; ca--and; param--transcendental; yat--that;
ubhayoh--both; api--certainly; sati--being situated; asaye--material desires; upadhau--designation; vai--
certainly; puman--the person; pasyati--sees; na anyada--not otherwise.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the soul exists for sense gratification, he creates different desires, and for that reason he becomes
subjected to designations. But when one is in the transcendental position, he is no longer interested in
anything except fulfilling the desires of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Being covered by material desires, a spirit soul is also considered to be covered by designations
belonging to a particular type of body. Thus he considers himself an animal, man, demigod, bird, beast,
etc. In so many ways he is influenced by false identification caused by false egotism, and being covered by
illusory material desires, he distinguishes between matter and spirit. When one is devoid of such
distinctions, there is no longer a difference between matter and spirit. At that time, the spirit is the only
predominating factor. As long as one is covered by material desires, he thinks himself the master or the
enjoyer. Thus he acts for sense gratification and becomes subjected to material pangs, happiness and
distress. But when one is freed from such a concept of life, he is no longer subjected to designations, and
he envisions everything as spiritual in connection with the Supreme Lord. This is explained by Srila Rupa
Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.255):
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayunjatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktam vairagyam ucyate
The liberated person has no attachment for anything material or for sense gratification. He understands
that everything is connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that everything should be
engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore he does not give up anything. There is no question of
renouncing anything because the paramahamsa knows how to engage everything in the service of the
Lord. Originally everything is spiritual; nothing is material. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.274)
also it is explained that a maha-bhagavata, a highly advanced devotee, has no material vision:
sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara murti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphurti
Although he sees trees, mountains, and other living entities moving here and there, he sees all as the
creation of the Supreme Lord and, with reference to the context, sees only the creator and not the created.
In other words, he no longer distinguishes between the created and the creator. He sees only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in everything. He sees Krsna in everything and everything in Krsna. This is
oneness.
