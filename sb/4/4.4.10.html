<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The followers of Lord Siva, the ghosts, were ready to injure or kill Daksa, but Sati stopped them by her
order. She was very angry and sorrowful, and in that mood she began to condemn the process of
sacrificial fruitive activities and persons who are very proud of such unnecessary and troublesome
sacrifices. She especially condemned her father, speaking against him in the presence of all.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The process of offering sacrifices is especially meant to satisfy Visnu, who is called Yajnesa because He is
the enjoyer of the fruits of all sacrifice. Bhagavad-gita (5.29) also confirms this fact. The Lord says,
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam. He is the actual beneficiary of all sacrifices. Not knowing this fact, less
intelligent men offer sacrifices for some material benefit. To derive personal material benefits for sense
gratification is the reason persons like Daksa and his followers perform sacrifices. Such sacrifices are
condemned here as a labor of love without actual profit. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam. One
may prosecute the Vedic injunctions of offering sacrifices and other fruitive activities, but if by such
activities one does not develop attraction for Visnu, they are useless labors. One who has developed love
for Visnu must develop love and respect for Visnu's devotees. Lord Siva is considered the foremost
personality amongst the Vaisnavas. Vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh. Thus when Sati saw that her father was
performing great sacrifices but had no respect for the greatest devotee, Lord Siva, she was very angry. This
is fitting; when Visnu or a Vaisnava is insulted, one should be angry. Lord Caitanya, who always preached
nonviolence, meekness and humility, also became angry when Nityananda was offended by Jagai and
Madhai, and He wanted to kill them. When Visnu or a Vaisnava is blasphemed or dishonored, one should
be very angry. Narottama dasa Thakura said, krodha bhakta-dvesi jane. We have anger, and that anger can
be a great quality when directed against a person who is envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
or His devotee. One should not be tolerant when a person is offensive towards Visnu or a Vaisnava. The
anger of Sati towards her father was not objectionable, for although he was her father, he was trying to
insult the greatest Vaisnava. Thus Sati's anger against her father was quite applaudable.
