<h2>Text</h2>
arthe hy avidyamane 'pi
samsrtir na nivartate
manasa linga-rupena
svapne vicarato yatha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
arthe--factual cause; hi--certainly; avidyamane--not existing; api--although; samsrtih--material existence;
na--not; nivartate--ceases; manasa--by the mind; linga-rupena--by subtle form; svapne--in a dream;
vicaratah--acting; yatha--as.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes we suffer because we see a tiger in a dream or a snake in a vision, but actually there is
neither a tiger nor a snake. Thus we create some situation in a subtle form and suffer the consequences.
These sufferings cannot be mitigated unless we are awakened from our dream.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Vedas, the living entity is always separate from two kinds of material bodies--the subtle
and the gross. All our sufferings are due to these material bodies. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita
(2.14):
matra-sparsas tu kaunteya
sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah
agamapayino 'nityas
tams titiksasva bharata
"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in
due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from
sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed." Lord
Krsna thus informed Arjuna that all the distresses brought about by the body come and go. One has to
learn how to tolerate them. Material existence is the cause of all our sufferings, for we do not suffer once
we are out of the material condition. The Vedas therefore enjoin that one should factually understand that
he is not material but is actually Brahman (aham brahmasmi). This understanding cannot be fully realized
unless one is engaged in Brahman activities, namely devotional service. To get free from the material
conditions, one has to take to Krsna consciousness. That is the only remedy.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The real interest of the living entity is to get out of the nescience that causes him to endure repeated
birth and death. The only remedy is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His
representative. Unless one renders devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Vasudeva, one cannot possibly become completely detached from this material world, nor can he possibly
manifest real knowledge.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the way to become detached from the artificial material condition. The only remedy is to take to
Krsna consciousness and constantly engage in the devotional service of Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Everyone is trying to be happy, and the process adopted to achieve that
happiness is called self-interest. Unfortunately, the conditioned soul hovering within this material world
does not know that his ultimate goal of self-interest is Vasudeva. Samsrti, or material existence, begins
with the illusioned bodily conception of life, and on the basis of this conception there ensues a series of
unwanted things (anarthas). These unwanted things are actually mental desires for various types of sense
gratification. In this way one accepts different types of bodies within this material world. One first has to
control the mind so that the desires of the mind can be purified. This process is described in the Naradapancaratra
as sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tatparatvena nirmalam. Unless one purifies his mind, there is no
question of getting free from the material condition. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.7.6):
anarthopasamam saksad
bhakti-yogam adhoksaje
lokasyajanato vidvams
cakre satvata-samhitam
"The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by
the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the
learned Vyasadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth." Anarthas,
unwanted things, come down from one bodily life to another. To get out of this entanglement, one has to
take to the devotional service of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word
guru is significant in this connection. The word guru may be translated as "heavy," or "the supreme." In
other words, the guru is the spiritual master. Srila Rsabhadeva advised His sons, gurur na sa syat. .. na
mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum: "One should not take up the post of spiritual master unless he is able to
lead his disciple from the cycle of birth and death." (Bhag. 5.5.18) Material existence is actually a chain of
action and reaction brought about by different types of fruitive activities. This is the cause of birth and
death. One can stop this process only by engaging oneself in the service of Vasudeva.
Bhakti refers to those activities performed in the service of Lord Vasudeva. Because Lord Vasudeva is the
Supreme, one should engage oneself in His service, not in the service of the demigods. Devotional service
begins from the neophyte stage--the stage of observing the rules and regulations--and extends to the point
of spontaneous loving service to the Lord. The purpose of all stages is to satisfy Lord Vasudeva. When one
is perfectly advanced in the devotional service of Vasudeva, one becomes completely detached from the
service of the body, that is, his designated position in material existence. After becoming so detached, one
becomes actually perfect in knowledge and engages perfectly in the service of Lord Vasudeva. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu says, jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': "Every living entity is by constitutional
position an eternal servant of Krsna." As soon as one engages in the service of Lord Vasudeva, he attains
his normal constitutional position. This position is called the liberated stage. Muktir hitvanyatha-rupam
svarupena vyavasthitih: in the liberated stage, one is situated in his original Krsna conscious position. He
gives up all engagements in the service of matter, engagements concocted under the names of social
service, national service, community service, dog service, automobile service and so many other services
conducted under the illusion of "I" and mine.
As explained in the Second Chapter of the First Canto:
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires
causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." (Bhag. 1.2.7) Thus one must engage in the service
of Vasudeva without material desire, mental speculation or fruitive activity.
