<h2>Translation</h2>
When Queen Arci saw that her husband, who had been so merciful to her and the earth, no longer
showed symptoms of life, she lamented for a little while and then built a fiery pyre on top of a hill and
placed the body of her husband on it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After seeing all the life symptoms in her husband stop, the Queen lamented for a while. The word kincit
means "for a little while." The Queen was completely aware that her husband was not dead, although the
symptoms of life--action, intelligence and sense perception--had ceased. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.13):
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
When a living entity transfers from one body to another, a process generally known as death, a sane
man does not lament, for he knows that the living entity is not dead but is simply transferred from one
body to another. The Queen should have been afraid of being alone in the forest with the body of her
husband, but since she was a great wife of a great personality, she lamented for a while but immediately
understood that she had many duties to perform. Thus instead of wasting her time in lamentation, she
immediately prepared a fiery pyre on top of a hill and then placed the body of her husband on it to be
burned.
Maharaja Prthu is described here as dayita, for not only was he the king of the earth, but he treated the
earth as his protected child. Similarly, he protected his wife also. It was the duty of the king to give
protection to everyone, especially to the earth or land which he ruled, as well as the citizens and his
family members. Since Prthu Maharaja was a perfect king, he gave protection to everyone, and therefore
he is described here as dayita.
