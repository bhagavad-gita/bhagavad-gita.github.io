<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity is exactly like a dog, who, overcome with hunger, goes from door to door for some
food. According to his destiny, he sometimes receives punishment and is driven out and at other times
receives a little food to eat. Similarly, the living entity, being influenced by so many desires, wanders in
different species of life according to destiny. Sometimes he is high, and sometimes he is low. Sometimes
he goes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to hell, sometimes to the middle planets, and so on.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entity's position is herein likened to a dog's. By chance a dog may have a very rich owner, and
by chance he may become a street dog. As the dog of a rich man, he will live very opulently. Sometimes in
Western countries we hear of a master leaving millions of dollars to a dog in his will. Of course, there are
many dogs loitering in the street without food. Therefore, to liken the conditional existence of the living
entity to that of a dog is very appropriate. An intelligent human being, however, can understand that if he
has to live the life of a dog, he had best become Krsna's dog. In the material world a dog is sometimes
elevated and is sometimes on the street, but in the spiritual world, Krsna's dog is perpetually, eternally
happy. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung: vaisnava thakura tomara kukura baliya janaha
more. In this way Bhaktivinoda Thakura offers to become a Vaisnava's dog. A dog always keeps himself at
his master's door and does not allow any person unfavorable to the master to enter. Similarly, one should
engage in the service of a Vaisnava and try to please him in every respect. Unless one does so, he does not
make spiritual advancement. Apart from spiritual advancement, in the material world if one does not
develop his qualities in goodness, he cannot be promoted to the higher planetary system. As confirmed by
Bhagavad-gita (14.18):
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode
of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."
There are many varieties of life in the different planetary systems, and these come about due to the
living entity's developing his qualities in goodness, passion and ignorance. If one is in goodness, he is
promoted to the higher systems; if in passion, he remains in the middle systems; and if in ignorance, he is
pushed down to the lower species of life.
