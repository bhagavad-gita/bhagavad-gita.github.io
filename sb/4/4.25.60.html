<h2>Text</h2>
na tvam vidarbha-duhita
nayam virah suhrt tava
na patis tvam puranjanya
ruddho nava-mukhe yaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; tvam--you; vidarbha-duhita--daughter of Vidarbha; na--not; ayam--this; virah--hero; su-hrt--
well-wishing husband; tava--your; na--not; patih--husband; tvam--you; puranjanyah--of Puranjani;
ruddhah--captured; nava-mukhe--in the body having nine gates; yaya--by the material energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Actually, you are not the daughter of Vidarbha, nor is this man, Malayadhvaja, your well-wishing
husband. Nor were you the actual husband of Puranjani. You were simply captivated in this body of nine
gates.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world many living entities come into contact with one another and, increasing their
attachment to a particular type of body, become related as father, husband, mother, wife, etc. Actually
every living entity is a separate individual being, and it is because of his contact with matter that he comes
together with other bodies and becomes falsely related. False bodies create various associations in the
name of family, community, society and nationality. Actually every living entity is part and parcel of the
Supreme personality of Godhead, but the living entities are overly engrossed in the material body. The
Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears and gives instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita and
Vedic literatures. The Supreme Lord gives these instructions because He is the eternal friend of the living
entities. His instructions are important because by them the living entity can obtain liberation from bodily
engagement. As water passes down a river, many straws and grasses are carried from the shore. These
straws and grasses come together in the river's current, but when the waves toss this way and that, they
are separated and carried somewhere else. Similarly, the innumerable living entities within this material
world are being carried by the waves of material nature. Sometimes the waves bring them together, and
they form friendships and relate to one another on a bodily basis of family, community or nationality.
Eventually they are thrown out of association by the waves of material nature. This process has been
going on since the creation of material nature. In this regard, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings:
miche mayara vase, yaccha bhese',
khaccha habudubu, bhai
jiva krsna-dasa, ei visvasa,
karle ta' ara duhkha nai
"My dear living entities, you are being carried away by the waves of material nature. Sometimes you are
on the surface, sometimes you are being drowned. In this way your eternal life is being spoiled. If you
simply catch hold of Krsna and take shelter of His lotus feet, you will once again get free from all the
miserable material conditions."
In this verse the words suhrt ("well-wisher") and tava ("your") are very significant. One's so-called
husband, relative, son, father or whatever cannot actually be a well-wisher. The only actual well-wisher is
Krsna Himself, as Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita (5.29): suhrdam sarva-bhutanam. Society, friendship,
love and well-wishers are all simply results of being packed in different bodies. One should know this well
and try to get out of this bodily encagement into which one is thrown birth after birth. One should take
shelter of the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna, and return home, back to Godhead.
