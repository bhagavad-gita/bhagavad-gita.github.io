<h2>Text</h2>
devya ucuh
aho iyam vadhur dhanya
ya caivam bhu-bhujam patim
sarvatmana patim bheje
yajnesam srir vadhur iva
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devyah ucuh--the wives of the demigods said; aho--alas; iyam--this; vadhuh--the wife; dhanya--most
glorious; ya--who; ca--also; evam--as; bhu--of the world; bhujam--of all the kings; patim--the king; sarvaatmana--
with full understanding; patim--unto the husband; bheje--worshiped; yajna-isam--unto Lord
Visnu; srih--the goddess of fortune; vadhuh--wife; iva--like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The wives of the demigods said: All glories to Queen Arci! We can see that this queen of the great King
Prthu, the emperor of all the kings of the world, has served her husband with mind, speech and body
exactly as the goddess of fortune serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yajnesa, or Visnu.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words yajnesam srir vadhur iva indicate that Queen Arci served her husband just as the
goddess of fortune serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead Visnu. We can observe that even in the
history of this world, when Lord Krsna, the supreme Visnu, was ruling over Dvaraka, Queen Rukmini,
who was the chief of all Krsna's queens, used to serve Lord Krsna personally in spite of having many
hundreds of maidservants to assist her. Similarly, the goddess of fortune in the Vaikuntha planets also
serves Narayana personally, although there are many thousands of devotees prepared to serve the Lord.
This practice is also followed by the wives of the demigods, and in days past the wives of men also
followed this same principle. In Vedic civilization the husband and wife were not separated by such manmade
laws as divorce. We should understand the necessity for maintaining family life in human society
and should thus abolish this artificial law known as divorce. The husband and wife should live in Krsna
consciousness and follow in the footsteps of Laksmi-Narayana or Krsna-Rukmini. In this way peace and
harmony can be possible within this world.
