<h2>Text</h2>
duhkhesv ekatarenapi
daiva-bhutatma-hetusu
jivasya na vyavacchedah

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
duhkhesu--in the matter of distresses; ekatarena--from one kind; api--even; daiva--providence; bhuta--
other living entities; atma--the body and mind; hetusu--on account of; jivasya--of the living entity; na--
never; vyavacchedah--stopping; syat--is possible; cet--although; tat-tat--of those miseries; pratikriya--
counteraction.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entities are trying to counteract different miserable conditions pertaining to providence, other
living entities or the body and mind. Still, they must remain conditioned by the laws of nature, despite all
attempts to counter these laws.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Just as a dog wanders here and there for a piece of bread or punishment, the living entity perpetually
wanders about trying to be happy and planning in so many ways to counteract material misery. This is
called the struggle for existence. We can actually see in our daily lives how we are forced to make plans to
drive away miserable conditions. To get rid of one miserable condition, we have to put ourselves in
another kind of miserable condition. A poor man suffers for want of money, but if he wants to become
rich, he has to struggle in so many ways. Actually that is not a valid counteracting process but a snare of
the illusory energy. If one does not endeavor to counteract his situation but is satisfied with his position,
knowing that he has obtained his position through past activities, he can instead engage his energy to
develop Krsna consciousness. This is recommended in all Vedic literature.
tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido
na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah
tal labhyate duhkhavad anyatah sukham
kalena sarvatra gabhira-ramhasa
"Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that
purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down
to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be
obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do
not desire them." (Bhag. 1.5.18) One should simply try to develop his Krsna consciousness and not waste
his time trying to improve his material condition. Actually the material condition cannot be improved.
The process of improvement means accepting another miserable condition. However, if we endeavor to
improve our Krsna consciousness, the distresses of material life will disappear without extraneous
endeavor. Krsna therefore promises, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti,
declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." (Bg. 9.31) One who takes to the path of devotional
service will never be vanquished, despite all miseries of the body and mind and despite all misery brought
about by other living entities and providence, miseries which are beyond our control.
