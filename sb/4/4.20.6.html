<h2>Text</h2>
pujitah pujayam asa
tatra tatra maha-yasah
pauran janapadams tams tan
pritah priya-vara-pradah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pujitah--being worshiped; pujayam asa--offered worship; tatra tatra--here and there; maha-yasah--with a
background of great activities; pauran--the noble men of the city; jana-padan--common citizens; tan tan--
in that way; pritah--being satisfied; priya-vara-pradah--was ready to offer them all benediction.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Both the important citizens and the common citizens welcomed the King very heartily, and he also
bestowed upon them their desired blessings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A responsible king was always approachable by his citizens. Generally the citizens, great and common,
all had an aspiration to see the king and take benediction from him. The king knew this, and therefore
whenever he met the citizens he immediately fulfilled their desires or mitigated their grievances. In such
dealings, a responsible monarchy is better than a so-called democratic government in which no one is
responsible to mitigate the grievances of the citizens, who are unable to personally meet the supreme
executive head. In a responsible monarchy the citizens had no grievances against the government, and
even if they did, they could approach the king directly for immediate satisfaction.
