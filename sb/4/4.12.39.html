<h2>Text</h2>
sa bala eva puruso
matamaham anuvratah
adharmamsodbhavam mrtyum
tenabhavad adharmikah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--that; balah--child; eva--certainly; purusah--male; mata-maham--maternal grandfather; anuvratah--a
follower of; adharma--of irreligion; amsa--from a portion; udbhavam--who appeared; mrtyum--death;
tena--by this; abhavat--he became; adharmikah--irreligious.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
That boy was born partially in the dynasty of irreligion. His grandfather was death personified, and the
boy grew up as his follower; he became a greatly irreligious person.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The child's mother, Sunitha, was the daughter of death personified. Generally the daughter receives the
qualifications of her father, and the son acquires those of the mother. So, according to the axiomatic truth
that things equal to the same thing are equal to one another, the child born of King Anga became the
follower of his maternal grandfather. According to smrti-sastra, a child generally follows the principles of
his maternal uncle's house. Naranam matula-karma means that a child generally follows the qualities of
his maternal family. If the maternal family is very corrupt or sinful, the child, even though born of a good
father, becomes a victim of the maternal family. According to Vedic civilization, therefore, before the
marriage takes place an account is taken of both the boy's and girl's families. If according to astrological
calculation the combination is perfect, then marriage takes place. Sometimes, however, there is a mistake,
and family life becomes frustrating.
It appears that King Anga did not get a very good wife in Sunitha because she was the daughter of death
personified. Sometimes the Lord arranges an unfortunate wife for His devotee so that gradually, due to
family circumstances, the devotee becomes detached from his wife and home and makes progress in
devotional life. It appears that by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Anga,
although a pious devotee, got an unfortunate wife like Sunitha and later on a bad child like Vena. But the
result was that he got complete freedom from the entanglement of family life and left home to go back to
Godhead.
