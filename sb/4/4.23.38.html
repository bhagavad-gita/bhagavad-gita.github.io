<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
kam nu tvad-anyam ramaye
hy arati-jnam akovidam
asamparayabhimukham
asvastana-vidam pasum
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kam--unto whom; nu--then; tvat--than you; anyam--other; ramaye--I shall allow to enjoy; hi--certainly;
arati-jnam--without knowledge of sex enjoyment; akovidam--therefore almost foolish; asamparaya--
without knowledge of the next life; abhimukham--looking forward; asvastana-vidam--one who does not
know what is happening next; pasum--like animals.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Mow can I expect to unite with others, who are neither conversant about sex nor capable of knowing
how to enjoy life while living or after death? Such foolish persons are like animals because they do not
know the process of sense enjoyment in this life and after death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since there are 8,400,000 species of life, there are also many different living conditions. In the lower
grades of life (in plant and tree life) there is no system for sexual intercourse. In the upper grades (in the
life of birds and bees) there is sex, but the insects and animals do not know how to actually enjoy sex life.
In the human form of life, however, there is full knowledge of how to enjoy sex. Indeed, there are many
so-called philosophers who give directions on how to enjoy sex life. There is even a science called kamasastra,
which is the science of sex. In human life there are also such divisions as brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa. There is no sex life except in the grhastha, or householder, asrama. The
brahmacari is not allowed any sex, a vanaprastha voluntarily refrains from sex, and the sannyasi is
completely renounced. The karmis do not practice brahmacarya, vanaprastha or sannyasa life, for they are
very much interested in grhastha life. In other words, a human being is very much materially inclined.
Indeed, all living entities are materially inclined. They prefer grhastha life because there is a concession
for sex. The karmis think the other statuses of life are worse than animal life, for animals also have sex,
whereas the brahmacari, vanaprastha and sannyasi completely give up sex. The karmis, therefore, abhor
these orders of spiritual life.
