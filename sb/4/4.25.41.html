In this way King Malayadhvaja attained perfect knowledge because in his pure state he was directly
instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By means of such enlightening transcendental
knowledge, he could understand everything from all angles of vision.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words saksad bhagavatoktena guruna harina are very significant. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead speaks directly to the individual soul when the devotee has completely purified
himself by rendering devotional service to the Lord. Lord Krsna confirms this also in Bhagavad-gita
(10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me."
The Lord is the Supersoul seated in everyone's heart, and He acts as the caitya-guru, the spiritual master
within. However, He gives direct instructions only to the advanced, pure devotees. In the beginning, when
a devotee is serious and sincere, the Lord gives him directions from within to approach a bona fide
spiritual master. When one is trained by the spiritual master according to the regulative principles of
devotional service and is situated on the platform of spontaneous attachment for the Lord (raga-bhakti),
the Lord also gives instructions from within. Tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatam priti-purvakam. This
distinct advantage is obtained by a liberated soul. Having attained this stage, King Malayadhvaja was
directly in touch with the Supreme Lord and was receiving instructions from Him directly.
