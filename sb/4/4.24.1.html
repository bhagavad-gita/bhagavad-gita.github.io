<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King, after bewildering her husband in different ways and
bringing him under her control, the wife of King Puranjana gave him all satisfaction and enjoyed sex life
with him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After hunting in the forest, King Puranjana returned home, and after refreshing himself by taking a bath
and eating nice food, he searched for his wife. When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed,
as if neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved. He then became attracted
to her and began to enjoy her company. A living entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful
activities. These sinful activities may be compared to King Puranjana's hunting in the forest.
A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as yajna, vrata and dana--that is,
the performance of sacrifices, the taking of a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity. In
this way one may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time awaken his original
Krsna consciousness. By coming home, taking his bath, eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and
searching out his wife, King Puranjana came to his good consciousness in his family life. In other words, a
systematic family life as enjoined in the Vedas is better than an irresponsible sinful life. If a husband and
wife combine together in Krsna consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice. However, if a
husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in life, the implications of
materialistic life will again resume. Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore recommended, anasaktasya visayan
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255). Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together
for the advancement of spiritual life. The husband should engage in devotional service, and the wife
should be faithful and religious according to the Vedic injunctions. Such a combination is very good.
However, if the husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position becomes very
dangerous. Women in general are very much sexually inclined. Indeed, it is said that a woman's sex desire
is nine times stronger than a man's. It is therefore a man's duty to keep a woman under his control by
satisfying her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in religious activities. Of
course, a woman should have a few children and in this way not be disturbing to the man. Unfortunately,
if the man becomes attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes
abominable.
The great politician Canakya Pandita has said: bharya rupavati satruh--a beautiful wife is an enemy. Of
course every woman in the eyes of her husband is very beautiful. Others may see her as not very beautiful,
but the husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful. If the husband sees
the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is too much attracted to her. This attraction is the
attraction of sex. The whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature rajo-guna and tamoguna,
passion and ignorance. Generally women are very much passionate and are less intelligent;
therefore somehow or other a man should not be under the control of their passion and ignorance. By
performing bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, a man can be raised to the platform of goodness. If a
husband situated in the mode of goodness can control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the
woman is benefited. Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman becomes
obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness. Such a life becomes very welcome. The
intelligence of the man and woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progressive
march toward spiritual realization. Otherwise, the husband, coming under the control of the wife,
sacrifices his quality of goodness and becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance. In
this way the whole situation becomes polluted.
The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid of responsibility, but if in the
household life the husband becomes subordinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again
becomes prominent. In this way a man's material bondage becomes enhanced. Because of this, according
to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recommended to abandon his family life for the stages of
vanaprastha and sannyasa.
