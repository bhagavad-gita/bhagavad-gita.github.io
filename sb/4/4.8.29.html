<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya answered: Dhruva Maharaja's heart, which was pierced by the arrows of the harsh words of his
stepmother, was greatly aggrieved, and thus when he fixed upon his goal of life he did not forget her
misbehavior. He did not demand actual liberation from this material world, but at the end of his
devotional service, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared before him, he was simply
ashamed of the material demands he had in his mind.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This important verse has been discussed by many stalwart commentators. Why was Dhruva Maharaja
not very pleased, even after achieving the goal of life he desired? A pure devotee is always free from any
kind of material desires. In the material world, one's material desires are all most demonic; one thinks of
others as one's enemies, one thinks of revenge against one's enemies, one aspires to become the topmost
leader or topmost person in this material world, and thus one competes with all others. This has been
described in the Bhagavad-gita, Sixteenth Chapter, as asuric. A pure devotee has no demand from the
Lord. His only concern is to serve the Lord sincerely and seriously, and he is not at all concerned about
what will happen in the future. In the Mukunda-mala-stotra, King Kulasekhara, author of the book, states
in his prayer: "My dear Lord, I don't want any position of sense gratification within this material world. I
simply want to engage in Your service perpetually." Similarly, Lord Caitanya, in His Siksastaka, also
prayed, "My Lord, I do not want any amount of material wealth, I do not want any number of materialistic
followers, nor do I want any attractive wife to enjoy. The only thing I want is that I may engage life after
life in Your service." Lord Caitanya did not pray even for mukti, or liberation.
In this verse Maitreya replied to Vidura that Dhruva Maharaja, influenced by a revengeful attitude
towards his insulting stepmother, did not think of mukti, nor did he know what mukti was. Therefore he
failed to aim for mukti as his goal in life. But a pure devotee also does not want liberation. He is a soul
completely surrendered to the Supreme Lord, and he does not demand anything from the Lord. This
position was realized by Dhruva Maharaja when he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present
personally before him because he was elevated to the vasudeva platform. The vasudeva platform refers to
the stage at which material contamination is conspicuous by absence only, or in other words where there
is no question of the material modes of nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--and one can therefore
see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because on the vasudeva platform one can see God face to face,
the Lord is also called Vasudeva.
Dhruva Maharaja's demand was for a position so exalted that it was never enjoyed even by Lord Brahma,
his great-grandfather. Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so affectionate and kind towards His
devotee, especially to a devotee like Dhruva Maharaja, who went to render devotional service in the forest
alone at the age of only five years, that although the motive might be impure, the Lord does not consider
the motive; He is concerned with the service. But if a devotee has a particular motive, the Lord directly or
indirectly knows it, and therefore He does not leave the devotee's material desires unfulfilled. These are
some of the special favors by the Lord to a devotee.
Dhruva Maharaja was offered Dhruvaloka, a planet that was never resided upon by any conditioned
soul. Even Brahma, although the topmost living creature within this universe, was not allowed to enter
the Dhruvaloka. Whenever there is a crisis within this universe, the demigods go to see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and they stand on the beach of the Milk Ocean. So the
fulfillment of Dhruva Maharaja's demand--a position more exalted than that of even his great-grandfather,
Brahma--was offered to him.
Here in this verse the Lord is described as mukti-pati, which means "one under whose lotus feet there
are all kinds of mukti." There are five kinds of mukti--sayujya, sarupya, salokya, samipya and sarsti. Out
of these five muktis, which can be achieved by any person engaged in devotional service to the Lord, the
one which is known as sayujya is generally demanded by Mayavadi philosophers; they demand to become
one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lord. In the opinion of many scholars, this sayujyamukti,
although counted among the five kinds of mukti, is not actually mukti because from sayujya-mukti
one may again fall down to this material world. This information we have from Srimad-Bhagavatam
(10.2.32), wherein it is said, patanty adhah, which means "they again fall down." The monist philosopher,
after executing severe austerity, merges into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, but the living entity
always wants reciprocation in loving affairs. Therefore, although the monist philosopher is elevated to the
status of being one with the effulgence of the Lord, because there is no facility for associating with the
Lord and rendering service unto Him, he again falls into this material world, and his service propensity is
satisfied by materialistic welfare activities like humanitarianism, altruism and philanthropy. There are
many instances of such falldowns, even for great sannyasis in the Mayavada school.
Therefore Vaisnava philosophers do not accept sayujya-mukti to be within the category of mukti.
According to them, mukti means transferal to the loving service of the Lord from one's position of serving
maya. Lord Caitanya also says in this connection that the constitutional position of a living entity is to
render service to the Lord. That is real mukti. When one is situated in his original position, giving up
artificial positions, he is called mukta, or liberated. In the Bhagavad-gita this is confirmed: anyone who
engages in rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord is considered to be mukta, or brahmabhuta.
It is said in Bhagavad-gita that a devotee is considered to be on the brahma-bhuta platform when
he has no material contamination. In the Padma Purana this is also confirmed: mukti means engagement
in the service of the Lord.
The great sage Maitreya explained that Dhruva Maharaja did not desire in the beginning to engage in the
service of the Lord, but he wanted an exalted position better than his great-grandfather's. This is more or
less not service to the Lord but service to the senses. Even if one gets the position of Brahma, the most
exalted position in this material world, he is a conditioned soul. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati says that if
one is elevated to real, pure devotional service, he considers even great demigods like Brahma and Indra
to be on an equal level with an insignificant insect. The reason is that an insignificant insect has a desire
for sense gratification and even a great personality like Lord Brahma also wants to dominate this material
nature.
Sense gratification means domination over material nature. The whole competition between conditioned
souls is based upon domination of this material nature. Modern scientists are proud of their knowledge
because they are discovering new methods to dominate the laws of material nature. They think that this is
the advancement of human civilization--the more they can dominate the material laws, the more advanced
they think they are. Dhruva Maharaja's propensity in the beginning was like that. He wanted to dominate
this material world in a greater position than Lord Brahma. Therefore elsewhere it is described that after
the appearance of the Lord, when Dhruva Maharaja thought and compared his determination to his final
reward, he realized that he had wanted a few particles of broken glass but instead had received many
diamonds. As soon as he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, he immediately became
conscious of the unimportance of his demand from the Lord to have an exalted position better than Lord
Brahma's.
When Dhruva Maharaja became situated on the vasudeva platform due to seeing the Lord face to face,
all his material contamination was cleared. Thus he became ashamed of what his demands were and what
he had achieved. He was very much ashamed to think that although he had gone to Madhuvana, giving up
the kingdom of his father, and he had gotten a spiritual master like Narada Muni, he was still thinking of
revenge against his stepmother and wanted to occupy an exalted post within this material world. These
were the causes for his moroseness even alter he received all the desired benedictions from the Lord.
When Dhruva Maharaja factually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there was no question of a
revengeful attitude towards his stepmother nor any aspiration to lord it over the material world, but the
Supreme Personality is so kind that He knew that Dhruva Maharaja wanted these. Speaking before Dhruva
Maharaja, He used the word vedaham because when Dhruva Maharaja demanded material benefits, the
Lord was present within his heart and so knew everything. The Lord always knows everything a man is
thinking. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita also: vedaham samatitani.
The Lord fulfilled all Dhruva Maharaja's desires. His revengeful attitude towards his stepmother and
stepbrother was satisfied, his desire for a more exalted position than that of his great-grandfather was also
fulfilled, and at the same time, his eternal position in Dhruvaloka was fixed. Although Dhruva Maharaja's
achievement of an eternal planet was not conceived of by him, Krsna thought, "What will Dhruva do with
an exalted position within this material world?" Therefore He gave Dhruva the opportunity to rule this
material world for thirty-six thousand years with unchangeable senses and the chance to perform many
great sacrifices and thus become the most reputed king within this material world. And, after finishing
with all this material enjoyment, Dhruva would be promoted to the spiritual world, which includes the
Dhruvaloka.
