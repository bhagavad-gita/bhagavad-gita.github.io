diksita brahma-satrena
sarva-bhutatma-medhasa
praticyam disi velayam
siddho 'bhud yatra jajalih
SYNONYMS
diksitah--being determined; brahma-satrena--by understanding of the Supreme Spirit; sarva--all; bhuta--
living entities; atma-medhasa--considering like one's self; praticyam--in the western; disi--direction;
velayam--on the seashore; siddhah--perfect; abhut--became; yatra--where; jajalih--the great sage Jajali.
TRANSLATION
The Pracetas went to the seashore in the west where the great liberated sage Jajali was residing. After
perfecting the spiritual knowledge by which one becomes equal toward all living entities, the Pracetas
became perfect in Krsna consciousness.
PURPORT
The word brahma-satra means "cultivation of spiritual knowledge." Actually, both the Vedas and severe
austerity are known as brahma. Vedas tattvam tapo brahma. Brahma also means "the Absolute Truth."
One has to cultivate knowledge of the Absolute Truth by pursuing studies in the Vedas and undergoing
severe austerities and penances. The Pracetas properly executed this function and consequently became
equal to all other living entities. As Bhagavad-gita (18.54) confirms:
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully
joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that
state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."
When one actually becomes spiritually advanced, he does not see the difference between one living
entity and another. This platform is attained by determination. When perfect knowledge is expanded, one
ceases to see the outward covering of the living entity. He sees, rather, the spirit soul within the body.
Thus he does not make distinctions between a human being and an animal, a learned brahmana and a
candala.
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." (Bg. 5.18)
A learned person sees everyone equally on a spiritual basis, and a learned person, a devotee, wants to see
everyone developed in Krsna consciousness. The place where the Pracetas were residing was perfect for
executing spiritual activities, for it is indicated that the great sage Jajali attained mukti (liberation) there.
One desiring perfection or liberation should associate with a person who is already liberated. This is
called sadhu-sanga, associating with a perfect devotee.
