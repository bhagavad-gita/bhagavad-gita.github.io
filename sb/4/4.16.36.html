<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, I am also the creation of one of Your energies, composed of the three modes of material
nature. Consequently I am bewildered by Your activities. Even the activities of Your devotees cannot be
understood, and what to speak of Your pastimes. Thus everything appears to us to be contradictory and
wonderful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms and incarnations are always
uncommon and wonderful. It is not possible for a tiny human being to estimate the purpose and plans of
such activities; therefore Srila Jiva Gosvami has said that unless the Lord's activities are accepted as
inconceivable, they cannot be explained. The Lord is eternally existing as Krsna, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, in Goloka Vrndavana. He has also simultaneously expanded Himself in innumerable forms,
beginning with Lord Rama, Lord Nrsimha, Lord Varaha and all the incarnations coming directly from
Sankarsana. Sankarsana is the expansion of Baladeva, and Baladeva is the first manifestation of Krsna.
Therefore all these incarnations are known as kala.
The word isvaranam refers to all the Personalities of Godhead. As stated in Brahma-samhita (5.39):
ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is confirmed that all the incarnations
are partial expansions, or kala, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, Krsna is the original
Supreme personality of Godhead. One should not take the plural number of the word isvaranam to mean
that there are many Godheads. The fact is that God is one, but He exists eternally and expands Himself in
innumerable forms and acts in various ways. Sometimes the common man is bewildered by all this and
considers such activities contradictory, but they are not contradictory. There is a great plan behind all the
Lord's activities.
For our understanding it is sometimes said that the Lord is situated in the heart of the thief as well as in
the heart of the householder, but the Supersoul in the heart of the thief dictates, "Go and steal things from
that particular house," and at the same time the Lord tells the householder, "Now be careful of thieves
and burglars." These instructions to different persons appear contradictory, yet we should know that the
Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has some plan, and we should not consider such
activities contradictory. The best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead
wholeheartedly, and, being protected by Him, remain peaceful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Maharaja Prthu Becomes Angry at the Earth."
Chapter Eighteen
Prthu Maharaja Milks the Earth Planet
