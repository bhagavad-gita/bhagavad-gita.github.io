<h2>Text</h2>
svam lokam na vidus te vai
yatra devo janardanah
ahur dhumra-dhiyo vedam
sakarmakam atad-vidah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
svam--own; lokam--abode; na--never; viduh--know; te--such persons; vai--certainly; yatra--where;
devah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; janardanah--Krsna, or Visnu; ahuh--speak; dhumra-dhiyah--
the less intelligent class of men; vedam--the four Vedas; sa-karmakam--full of ritualistic ceremonies; a-tatvidah--
persons who are not in knowledge.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are less intelligent accept the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies as all in all. They do not know that
the purpose of the Vedas is to understand one's own home, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead
lives. Not being interested in their real home, they are illusioned and search after other homes.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally people are not aware of their interest in life--to return home, back to Godhead. People do not
know about their real home in the spiritual world. In the spiritual world there are many Vaikuntha
planets, and the topmost planet is Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana. Despite the so-called advancement of
civilization, there is no information of the Vaikunthalokas, the spiritual planets. At the present moment
so-called advanced civilized men are trying to go to other planets, but they do not know that even if they
go to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, they have to come back again to this planet. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein
repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth
again."
If one goes to the highest planetary system within this universe he still has to return after the effects of
pious activities are finished. Space vehicles may go very high in the sky, but as soon as their fuel is
finished, they have to return to this earthly planet. All these activities are performed in illusion. The real
attempt should now be to return home, back to Godhead. The process is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita.
Yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam: those who engage in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead return home, back to Godhead. Human life is very valuable, and one should not waste it in vain
exploration of other planets. One should be intelligent enough to return to Godhead. One should be
interested in information about the spiritual Vaikuntha planets, and in particular the planet known as
Goloka Vrndavana, and should learn the art of going there by the simple method of devotional service,
beginning with hearing (sravanam kirtanam visnoh). This is also confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(12.3.51):
kaler dosa-nidhe rajann
asti hy eko mahan gunah
kirtanad eva krsnasya
mukta-sangah param vrajet
One can go to the supreme planet (param vrajet) simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra. This is
especially meant for the people of this age (kaler dosa-nidhe). It is the special advantage of this age that
simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra one can become purified of all material contamination
and return home, back to Godhead. There is no doubt about this.
