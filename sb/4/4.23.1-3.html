<h2>Translation</h2>
At the last stage of his life, when Maharaja Prthu saw himself getting old, that great soul, who was king
of the world, divided whatever opulence he had accumulated amongst all kinds of living entities, moving
and nonmoving. He arranged pensions for everyone according to religious principles, and after executing
the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in complete coordination with Him, he dedicated his
sons unto the earth, which was considered to be his daughter. Then Maharaja Prthu left the presence of
his citizens, who were almost lamenting and crying from feeling separation from the King, and went to
the forest alone with his wife to perform austerities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Prthu was one of the saktyavesa incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as
such he appeared on the surface of the earth to execute the orders of the Supreme. As stated in Bhagavadgita,
the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all planets, and He is always anxious to see that in each and
every planet the living entities are happily living and executing their duties. As soon as there is some
discrepancy in the execution of duties, the Lord appears on earth, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata.
Since there were so many discrepancies during the reign of King Vena, the Lord sent His most
confidential devotee Maharaja Prthu to settle things. Therefore, after executing the orders of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and settling the affairs of the world, Maharaja Prthu was ready to retire. He had
been exemplary in his governmental administration, and now he was to become exemplary in his
retirement. He divided all his property amongst his sons and appointed them to rule the world, and then
he went to the forest with his wife. It is significant in this connection that it is said that Maharaja Prthu
retired alone and at the same time took his wife with him. According to Vedic principles, when retiring
from family life, one can take his wife with him, for the husband and wife are considered to be one unit.
Thus they can both combinedly perform austerities for liberation. This is the path that Maharaja Prthu,
who was an exemplary character, followed, and this is also the way of Vedic civilization. One should not
simply remain at home until the time of death, but should separate from family life at a timely moment
and prepare himself to go back to Godhead. As a saktyavesa incarnation of God who had actually come
from Vaikuntha as a representative of Krsna, Maharaja Prthu was certain to go back to Godhead.
Nonetheless, in order to set the example in all ways, he also underwent severe austerities in the tapo-vana.
It appears that in those days there were many tapo-vanas, or forests especially meant for retirement and
the practice of austerities. Indeed, it was compulsory for everyone to go to the tapo-vana to fully accept
the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for it is very difficult to retire from family life and at
the same time remain at home.
