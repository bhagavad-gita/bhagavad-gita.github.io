<h2>Text</h2>
nisidhyamanah sa sadasya-mukhyair
dakso giritraya visrjya sapam
tasmad viniskramya vivrddha-manyur
jagama kauravya nijam niketanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nisidhyamanah--being requested not to; sah--he (Daksa); sadasya-mukhyaih--by the members of the
sacrifice; daksah--Daksa; giritraya--to Siva; visrjya--giving; sapam--a curse; tasmat--from that place;
viniskramya--going out; vivrddha-manyuh--being exceedingly angry; jagama--went; kauravya--O Vidura;
nijam--to his own; niketanam--home.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, in spite of the requests of all the members of the sacrificial
assembly, Daksa, in great anger, cursed Lord Siva and then left the assembly and went back to his home.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Anger is so detrimental that even a great personality like Daksa, out of anger, left the arena where
Brahma was presiding and all the great sages and pious and saintly persons were assembled. All of them
requested him not to leave, but, infuriated, he left, thinking that the auspicious place was not fit for him.
Puffed up by his exalted position, he thought that no one was greater than he in argument. It appears that
all the members of the assembly, including Lord Brahma, requested him not to be angry and leave their
company, but in spite of all these requests, he left. That is the effect of cruel anger. In Bhagavad-gita,
therefore, it is advised that one who desires to make tangible advancement in spiritual consciousness must
avoid three things--lust, anger and the mode of passion. Actually we can see that lust, anger and passion
make a man crazy, even though he be as great as Daksa. The very name Daksa suggests that he was expert
in all material activities, but still, because of his aversion towards such a saintly personality as Siva, he was
attacked by these three enemies--anger, lust and passion. Lord Caitanya, therefore, advised that one be
very careful not to offend Vaisnavas. He compared offenses toward a Vaisnava to a mad elephant. As a
mad elephant can do anything horrible, so when a person offends a Vaisnava he can perform any
abominable action.
