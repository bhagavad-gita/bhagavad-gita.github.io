<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
iti bruvanam nrpatim
gayaka muni-coditah
tustuvus tusta-manasas
tad-vag-amrta-sevaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--the great sage Maitreya said; iti--thus; bruvanam--speaking; nrpatim--the King;
gayakah--the reciters; muni--by the sages; coditah--having been instructed; tustuvuh--praised, satisfied;
tusta--being pleased; manasah--their minds; tat--his; vak--words; amrta--nectarean; sevaya--by hearing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: While King Prthu thus spoke, the humility of his nectarean speeches
pleased the reciters very much. Then again they continued to praise the King highly with exalted prayers,
as they had been instructed by the great sages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the word muni-coditah indicates instructions received from great sages and saintly persons.
Although Maharaja Prthu was simply enthroned on the royal seat and was not at that time exhibiting his
godly powers, the reciters like the suta, the magadha and the vandi understood that King Prthu was an
incarnation of God. They could understand this by the instructions given by the great sages and learned
brahmanas. We have to understand the incarnations of God by the instructions of authorized persons. We
cannot manufacture a God by our own concoctions. As stated by Narottama dasa Thakura, sadhu-sastraguru:
one has to test all spiritual matters according to the instructions of saintly persons, scriptures and
the spiritual master. The spiritual master is one who follows the instructions of his predecessors, namely
the sadhus, or saintly persons. A bona fide spiritual master does not mention anything not mentioned in
the authorized scriptures. Ordinary people have to follow the instructions of sadhu, sastra and guru.
Those statements made in the sastras and those made by the bona fide sadhu or guru cannot differ from
one another.
Reciters like the suta and the magadha were confidentially aware that King Prthu was an incarnation of
the Personality of Godhead. Although the King denied such praise because he was not at that time
exhibiting his godly qualities, the reciters did not stop praising him. Rather, they were very pleased with
the King, who, although actually an incarnation of God, was so humble and delightful in his dealings with
devotees. In this connection we may note that previously (4.15.21) it was mentioned that King Prthu was
smiling and was in a pleasant mood while speaking to the reciters. Thus we have to learn from the Lord or
His incarnation how to become gentle and humble. The King's behavior was very pleasing to the reciters,
and consequently the reciters continued their praise and even foretold the King's future activities, as they
had been instructed by the sadhus and sages.
