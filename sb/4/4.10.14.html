haha-karas tadaivasit
siddhanam divi pasyatam
hato 'yam manavah suryo
magnah punya-janarnave
SYNONYMS
haha-karah--tumult of disappointment; tada--at that time; eva--certainly; asit--became manifest;
siddhanam--of all the residents of Siddhaloka; divi--in the sky; pasyatam--who were observing the fight;
hatah--killed; ayam--this; manavah--grandson of Manu; suryah--sun; magnah--set; punya-jana--of the
Yaksas; arnave--in the ocean.
TRANSLATION
All the Siddhas from the higher planetary systems were observing the fight from the sky, and when they
saw that Dhruva Maharaja had been covered by the incessant arrows of the enemy, they roared
tumultuously, "The grandson of Manu, Dhruva, is now lost!" They cried that Dhruva Maharaja was just
like the sun and that now he had set within the ocean of the Yaksas.
PURPORT
In this verse the word manava is very significant. Generally this word is used to mean "human being."
Dhruva Maharaja is also described here as manava. Not only is Dhruva Maharaja a descendant of Manu,
but all human society descends from Manu. According to Vedic civilization, Manu is the lawgiver. Even
today Hindus in India follow the laws given by Manu. Everyone, therefore, in human society is a manava,
or descendant from Manu, but Dhruva Maharaja is a distinguished manava because he is a great devotee.
The denizens of the planet Siddhaloka, where the residents can fly in the sky without airplanes, were
anxious over Dhruva Maharaja's welfare in the battlefield. Srila Rupa Gosvami says, therefore, that not
only is a devotee well protected by the Supreme Lord, but all the demigods, and even ordinary men, are
anxious for his security and safety. The comparison given here that Dhruva Maharaja appeared to merge
in the ocean of the Yaksas is also significant. When the sun sets on the horizon, it appears that the sun
drowns in the ocean, but factually the sun has no difficulty. Similarly, although Dhruva appeared to
drown in the ocean of the Yaksas, he had no difficulty. As the sun rises again in due course at the end of
night, so Dhruva Maharaja, although he might have been in difficulty (because, after all, it was a fight, and
in any fighting activities there are reverses), that did not mean that he was defeated.
