samprasanne bhagavati
purusah prakrtair gunaih
vimukto jiva-nirmukto

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
samprasanne--upon satisfaction; bhagavati--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; purusah--a person;
prakrtaih--from the material; gunaih--modes of nature; vimuktah--being liberated; jiva-nirmuktah--freed
from the subtle body also; brahma--unlimited; nirvanam--spiritual bliss; rcchati--achieves.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who actually satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead during one's lifetime becomes liberated
from the gross and subtle material conditions. Thus being freed from all material modes of nature, he
achieves unlimited spiritual bliss.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verse it has been explained that one should treat all living entities with tolerance, mercy,
friendship and equality. By such behavior one satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and upon His
satisfaction the devotee immediately becomes free from all material conditions. The Lord also confirms
this in the Bhagavad-gita: "Anyone who sincerely and seriously engages in My service immediately
becomes situated in the transcendental stage wherein he can enjoy unlimited spiritual bliss." Everyone in
this material world is struggling hard in order to achieve blissful life. Unfortunately, people do not know
how to achieve it. Atheists do not believe in God, and certainly they do not please Him. Here it is clearly
said that upon pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead one immediately attains to the spiritual
platform and enjoys unlimited blissful life. To become free from material existence means to become free
from the influence of material nature.
The word samprasanne, which is used in this verse, means "being satisfied." A person should act in such
a way that the Lord is satisfied by the activity; it is not that he himself is to be satisfied. Of course, when
the Lord is satisfied, the devotee automatically becomes satisfied. This is the secret of the process of
bhakti-yoga. Outside of bhakti-yoga, everyone is trying to satisfy himself. No one is trying to satisfy the
Lord. Karmis grossly try to satisfy their senses, but even those who are elevated to the platform of
knowledge also try to satisfy themselves, in a subtle form. Karmis try to satisfy themselves by sense
gratification, and jnanis try to satisfy themselves by subtle activities or mental speculation and thinking
themselves to be God. Yogis also try to satisfy themselves, by thinking that they can achieve different
mystic perfections. But only devotees try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees'
process of self-realization is completely different from the processes of the karmis, jnanis and yogis.
Everyone else is trying to satisfy himself, whereas the devotee tries only to satisfy the Lord. The
devotional process is completely different from the others; by working to please the Lord by engaging his
senses in the Lord's loving service, the devotee is immediately situated on the transcendental platform,
and he enjoys unlimited blissful life.
