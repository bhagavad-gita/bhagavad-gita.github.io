<h2>Translation</h2>
In the Vedas there are directions for two kinds of activities--activities for those who are attached to
material enjoyment and activities for those who are materially detached. In consideration of these two
kinds of activities, there are two kinds of people, who have different symptoms. If one wants to see two
kinds of activities in one person, that is contradictory. But both kinds of activities may be neglected by a
person who is transcendentally situated.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic activities are so designed that the conditioned soul who has come to enjoy the material world
may do so under direction so that at the end he becomes detached from such material enjoyment and is
eligible to enter into the transcendental position. The four different social orders--brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa--gradually train a person to come to the platform of transcendental life. The
activities and dress of a grhastha, or householder, are different from those of a sannyasi, one in the
renounced order of life. lt is impossible for one person to adopt both orders. A sannyasi cannot act like a
householder, nor can a householder act like a sannyasi, but above these two kinds of persons, one who
engages in material activities and one who has renounced material activities, there is the person who is
transcendental to both. Lord Siva is in the transcendental position because, as stated before, he is always
absorbed in the thought of Lord Vasudeva within himself. Therefore neither the activities of the grhastha
nor those of the sannyasi in the renounced order can be applicable for him. He is in the paramahamsa
stage, the highest perfectional stage of life. The transcendental position of Lord Siva is also explained in
Bhagavad-gita (2.52-53). It is stated there that when one fully engages in the transcendental service of the
Lord by performing activities without fruitive results, one is elevated to the transcendental position. At
that time he has no obligation to follow the Vedic injunctions or the different rules and regulations of the
Vedas. When one is above the directions of the Vedic ritualistic injunctions for attaining different
allurements and is fully absorbed in transcendental thought, which means thought of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in devotional service, one is in the position called buddhi-yoga, or samadhi,
ecstasy. For a person who has attained this stage, neither the Vedic activities for realizing material
enjoyment nor those for renunciation are applicable.
