so 'pi sankalpajam visnoh
pada-sevopasaditam
prapya sankalpa-nirvanam
natiprito 'bhyagat puram
SYNONYMS
sah--he (Dhruva Maharaja); api--although; sankalpa-jam--the desired result; visnoh--of Lord Visnu;
pada-seva--by serving the lotus feet; upasaditam--obtained; prapya--having achieved; sankalpa--of his
determination; nirvanam--the satisfaction; na--not; atipritah--very much pleased; abhyagat--he returned;
puram--to his home.
TRANSLATION
Despite having achieved the desired result of his determination by worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord,
Dhruva Maharaja was not very pleased. Thus he returned to his home.
PURPORT
By worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord in devotional service as instructed by Narada Muni, Dhruva
Maharaja achieved the desired result. His desire was to get a very exalted position, excelling that of his
father, grandfather and great-grandfather, and although it was a somewhat childish determination because
Dhruva Maharaja was nothing but a small child, Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is so
kind and merciful that He fulfilled Dhruva's desire. Dhruva Maharaja wanted a residence more exalted
than any ever occupied by anyone else in his family. Therefore he was offered the planet in which the
Lord personally resides, and his determination was completely satisfied. Still, when Dhruva Maharaja
returned home he was not very much pleased, for although in pure devotional service there is no demand
from the Lord, because of his childish nature he had demanded something. Thus although the Lord also
fulfilled his desire, he was not very pleased. Rather, he was ashamed that he had demanded something
from the Lord, for he should not have done this.
