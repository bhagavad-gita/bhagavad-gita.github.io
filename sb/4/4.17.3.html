<h2>Translation</h2>
To benefit all human society, not only in this life but in the next, the great seers and sages have
prescribed various methods conducive to the prosperity of the people in general.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vedic civilization takes advantage of the perfect knowledge presented in the Vedas and presented by
great sages and brahmanas for the benefit of human society. Vedic injunctions are known as sruti, and the
additional supplementary presentations of these principles, as given by the great sages, are known as
smrti. They follow the principles of Vedic instruction. Human society should take advantage of the
instructions from both sruti and smrti. If one wants to advance in spiritual life, he must take these
instructions and follow the principles. In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila Rupa Gosvami says that if one
poses himself as advanced in spiritual life but does not refer to the srutis and smrtis he is simply a
disturbance in society. One should follow the principles laid down in srutis and smrtis not only in one's
spiritual life but in material life as well. As far as human society is concerned, it should follow the Manusmrti
as well, for these laws are given by Manu, the father of mankind.
In the Manu-smrti it is stated that a woman should not be given independence, but should be given
protection by her father, husband and elderly sons. In all circumstances a woman should remain
dependent upon some guardian. Presently women are given full independence like men, but actually we
can see that such independent women are no happier than those women who are placed under guardians.
If people follow the injunctions given by the great sages, srutis and smrtis, they can actually be happy in
both this life and the next. Unfortunately rascals are manufacturing so many ways and means to be happy.
Everyone is inventing so many methods. Consequently human society has lost the standard ways of life,
both materially and spiritually, and as a result people are bewildered, and there is no peace or happiness
in the world. Although they are trying to solve the problems of human society in the United Nations, they
are still baffled. Because they do not follow the liberated instructions of the Vedas, they are unhappy.
Two significant words used in this verse are asmin and amusmin. Asmin means "in this life," and
amusmin means "in the next life." Unfortunately in this age, even exalted professors and learned men
believe that there is no next life and that everything is finished in this life. Since they are rascals and fools,
what advice can they give? Still they are passing as learned scholars and professors. In this verse the word
amusmin is very explicit. It is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will have a
profitable next life. Just as a boy is educated in order to become happy later, one should be educated in
this life in order to attain an eternal and prosperous life after death. It is therefore essential that people
follow what is given in the srutis and smrtis to make sure that the human mission is successful.
