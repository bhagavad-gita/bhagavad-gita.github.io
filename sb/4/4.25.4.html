<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni asked King Pracinabarhisat: My dear King, what do you desire to achieve by performing
these fruitive activities? The chief aim of life is to get rid of all miseries and enjoy happiness, but these two
things cannot be realized by fruitive activity.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this material world there is a great illusion which covers real intelligence. A man in the mode of
passion wants to work very hard to derive some benefit, but he does not know that time will never allow
him to enjoy anything permanently. Compared with the work one expends, the gain is not so profitable.
Even if it is profitable, it is not without its distresses. If a man is not born rich and he wants to purchase a
house, cars and other material things, he has to work hard day and night for many years in order to
possess them. Thus happiness is not attained without undergoing some distress.
Actually, pure happiness cannot be had within this material world. If we wish to enjoy something, we
must suffer for something else. On the whole, suffering is the nature of this material world, and whatever
enjoyment we are trying to achieve is simply illusion. After all, we have to suffer the miseries of birth, old
age, disease and death. We may discover many fine medicines, but it is not possible to stop the sufferings
of disease or death. Actually, medicine is not the counteracting agent for either disease or death. On the
whole there is no happiness in this material world, but an illusioned person works very hard for so-called
happiness. Indeed, this process of working hard is actually taken for happiness. This is called illusion.
Therefore Narada Muni asked King Pracinabarhisat what he desired to attain by performing so many
costly sacrifices. Even if one attains a heavenly planet, he cannot avoid the distresses of birth, old age,
disease and death. Someone may argue that even devotees have to undergo many distresses in executing
austerities and penances connected with devotional service. Of course, for the neophytes the routine of
devotional service may be very painful, but at least they have the hope that they will ultimately be able to
avoid all kinds of distresses and achieve the highest perfectional stage of happiness. For the common
karmis, there is no such hope because even if they are promoted to the higher planetary systems, they are
not guaranteed freedom from the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Even Lord Brahma, who is
situated in the highest planetary system (Brahmaloka), has to die. Lord Brahma's birth and death may be
different from an ordinary man's, but within this material world he cannot avoid the distresses of birth,
old age, disease and death. If one is at all serious about attaining liberation from these miseries, he must
take to devotional service. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
Thus after attaining full Krsna consciousness, the devotee does not return to this material world after
death. He goes back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfect stage of happiness, unblemished by any
trace of distress.
