<h2>Text</h2>
tayopabhujyamanam vai
yavanah sarvato-disam
dvarbhih pravisya subhrsam
prardayan sakalam purim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
taya--by Kalakanya; upabhujyamanam--being taken possession of; vai--certainly; yavanah--the Yavanas;
sarvatah-disam--from all sides; dvarbhih--through the gates; pravisya--having entered; su-bhrsam--greatly;
prardayan--giving trouble; sakalam--all over; purim--the city.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Kalakanya, daughter of Time, attacked the body, the dangerous soldiers of the King of the
Yavanas entered the city through different gates. They then began to give severe trouble to all the citizens.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The body has nine gates--the two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, rectum and genitals. When one is
harassed by the invalidity of old age, various diseases manifest at the gates of the body. For example, the
eyes become so dim that one requires spectacles, and the ears become too weak to hear directly, and
therefore one requires hearing aids. The nostrils are blocked by mucus, and one has to always sniff a
medicinal bottle containing ammonia. Similarly, the mouth, too weak to chew, requires false teeth. The
rectum also gives one trouble, and the evacuation process becomes difficult. Sometimes one has to take
enemas and sometimes use a surgical nozzle to accelerate the passing of urine. In this way the city of
Puranjana was attacked at various gates by the soldiers. Thus in old age all the gates of the body are
blocked by so many diseases, and one has to take help from so many medicines and surgical appliances.
