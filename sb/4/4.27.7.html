brhad-balam mano vidyad
ubhayendriya-nayakam
pancalah panca visaya
yan-madhye nava-kham puram
SYNONYMS
brhat-balam--very powerful; manah--the mind; vidyat--one should know; ubhaya-indriya--of both
groups of senses; nayakam--the leader; pancalah--the kingdom named Pancala; panca--five; visayah--sense
objects; yat--of which; madhye--in the midst; nava-kham--having nine apertures; puram--the city.
TRANSLATION
The eleventh attendant, who is the commander of the others, is known as the mind. He is the leader of
the senses both in the acquisition of knowledge and in the performance of work. The Pancala kingdom is
that atmosphere in which the five sense objects are enjoyed. Within that Pancala kingdom is the city of
the body, which has nine gates.
PURPORT
The mind is the center of all activities and is described here as brhad-bala, very powerful. To get out of
the clutches of maya, material existence, one has to control his mind. According to training, the mind is
the friend and the enemy of the living entity. If one gets a good manager, his estate is very nicely
managed, but if the manager is a thief, his estate is spoiled. Similarly, in his material, conditional
existence, the living entity gives power of attorney to his mind. As such, he is liable to be misdirected by
his mind into enjoying sense objects. Srila Ambarisa Maharaja therefore first engaged his mind upon the
lotus feet of the Lord. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. When the mind is engaged in meditation on
the lotus feet of the Lord, the senses are controlled. This system of control is called yama, and this means
"subduing the senses." One who can subdue the senses is called a gosvami, but one who cannot control
the mind is called go-dasa. The mind directs the activities of the senses, which are expressed through
different outlets, as described in the next verse.
