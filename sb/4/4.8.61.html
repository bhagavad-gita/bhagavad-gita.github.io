bhakti-yogena bhuyasa
tam nirantara-bhavena

<br>

bhakti-yogena--by the process of devotional service; bhuyasa--with great seriousness; tam--unto Him (the

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
If one is very serious about liberation, he must stick to the process of transcendental loving service,
engaging twenty-four hours a day in the highest stage of ecstasy, and he must certainly be aloof from all
activities of sense gratification.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are different stages of perfection according to different persons' objectives. Generally people are
karmis, for they engage in activities of sense gratification. Above the karmis are the jnanis, who are trying
to become liberated from material entanglement. Yogis are still more advanced because they meditate on
the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And above all these are the devotees, who simply
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord; they are situated seriously on the topmost
platform of ecstasy.
Here Dhruva Maharaja is advised that if he has no desire for sense gratification, then he should directly
engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The path of apavarga, or liberation, begins
from the stage called moksa. ln this verse the word vimuktaye, "for liberation," is especially mentioned. If
one wants to he happy within this material world, he may aspire to go to the different material planetary
systems where there is a higher standard of sense gratification, but real moksa, or liberation, is performed
without any such desire. This is explained in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by the term anyabhilasitasunyam,
"without desire for material sense gratification." For persons who are still inclined to enjoy
material life in different stages or on different planets, the stage of liberation in bhakti-yoga is not
recommended. Only persons who are completely free from the contamination of sense gratification can
execute bhakti-yoga, or the process of devotional service, very purely. The activities on the path of
apavarga up to the stages of dharma, artha and kama are meant for sense gratification, but when one
comes to the stage of moksa, the impersonalist liberation, the practitioner wants to merge into the
existence of the Supreme. But that is also sense gratification. When one goes above the stage of liberation,
however, he at once becomes one of the associates of the Lord to render transcendental loving service.
That is technically called vimukti. For this specific vimukti liberation, Narada Muni recommends that one
directly engage himself in devotional service.
