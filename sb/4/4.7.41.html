ekam hy eva hares tatra

and liberation; akhyam--by the name; yah--who; icchet--may desire; sreyah--the goal of life; atmanah--of

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Any person who desires the fruits of the four principles religiosity, economic development, sense
gratification and, at the end, liberation, should engage himself in the devotional service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, for worship of His lotus feet yields the fulfillment of all of these.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that only with the sanction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can the
demigods offer benedictions. Therefore, whenever any sacrifice is offered to a demigod, the Supreme Lord
in the form of narayana-sila, or salagrama-sila, is put forward to observe the sacrifice. Actually, the
demigods cannot give any benediction without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. Narada Muni, therefore,
advised that even for religiosity, economic development, sense gratification or liberation, one should
approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, offer prayers and ask for the fulfillment of one's desire at
the lotus feet of the Lord. That is real intelligence. An intelligent person never goes to demigods to pray
for anything. He goes directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all benediction.
As Lord Sri Krsna has said in Bhagavad-gita, performance of ritualistic ceremonies is not actually
religion. The real path of religion is to surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord. For one who is actually
surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord, there is no question of any separate endeavor for economic
development. A devotee engaged in service to the Lord is not disappointed in the satisfaction of his
senses. If he wants to satisfy his senses, Krsna fulfills that desire. As far as liberation is concerned, any
devotee fully engaged in the service of the Lord is already liberated; therefore there is no separate
necessity for his liberation.
Narada Muni therefore advised Dhruva Maharaja to take shelter of Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, and engage
himself in the way that his mother had advised, for that would help him fulfill his desire. In this verse
Narada Muni has especially stressed the devotional service of the Lord as the only way. In other words,
even if one is full of material desires, he can continue his devotional service to the Lord, and all his desires
will be fulfilled.
