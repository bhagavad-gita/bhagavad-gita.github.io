TRANSLATION
The fire-god said: My dear Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because by Your favor I am
as luminous as blazing fire and I accept the offerings mixed with butter and offered in sacrifice. The five
kinds of offerings according to the Yajur Veda are all Your different energies, and You are worshiped by
five kinds of Vedic hymns. Sacrifice means Your Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that yajna should be performed for Lord Visnu. Lord Visnu has one
thousand popular, transcendental names, out of which one name is Yajna. lt is clearly said that everything
should be done for the satisfaction of Yajna, or Visnu. All other actions a person may take are only causes
for his bondage. Everyone has to perform yajna according to the Vedic hymns. As stated in the Upanisads,
fire, the altar, the auspicious full moon, the period of four months called caturmasya, the sacrificial
animal, and the beverage called soma are necessary requisites, as are the specific hymns mentioned in the
Vedas and composed of four letters. One hymn is as follows: asravayeti catur-aksaram astu srausad iti
catur-aksaram yajeti dvabhyam ye yajamahah. These mantras, chanted according to the sruti and smrti
literatures, are only to please Lord Visnu. For the deliverance of those who are materially conditioned and
attached to material enjoyment, performing yajna and following the rules and regulations of the four
divisions of society and of spiritual life are recommended. It is said in the Visnu Purana that by offering
sacrifice to Visnu one can gradually be liberated. The whole target of life, therefore, is to please Lord
Visnu. That is yajna. Any person who is in Krsna consciousness has dedicated his life for the satisfaction
of Krsna, the origin of all Visnu forms, and by offering worship and prasada daily, he becomes the best
performer of yajna. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is clearly stated that in this age of Kali the only successful
performance of yajna, or sacrifice, is yajnaih sankirtana-prayaih: the best type of sacrifice is simply to
chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
This yajna is offered before the form of Lord Caitanya, as other yajnas are offered before the form of Lord
Visnu. These recommendations are found in the Eleventh Canto of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Moreover,
this yajna performance confirms that Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Visnu Himself. As Lord Visnu
appeared at the Daksa yajna long, long ago, Lord Caitanya has appeared in this age to accept our
sankirtana-yajna.
