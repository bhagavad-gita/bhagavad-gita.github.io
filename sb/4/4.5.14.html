yad dvy-aksaram nama gireritam nrnam
sakrt prasangad agham asu hanti tat

bhavan aho dvesti sivam sivetarah

by the tongue; nrnam--persons; sakrt--once; prasangat--from the heart; agham--sinful activities; asu--

TRANSLATION
Sati continued: My dear father, you are committing the greatest offense by envying Lord Siva, whose
very name, consisting of two syllables, si and va, purifies one of all sinful activities. His order is never
neglected. Lord Siva is always pure, and no one but you envies him.
PURPORT
Since Lord Siva is the greatest soul among the living entities within this material world, his name, Siva,
is very auspicious for persons who identify the body with the soul. If such persons take shelter of Lord
Siva, gradually they will understand that they are not the material body but are spirit soul. Siva means
mangala, or auspicious. Within the body the soul is auspicious. Aham brahmasmi: "I am Brahman." This
realization is auspicious. As long as one does not realize his identity as the soul, whatever he does is
inauspicious. Siva means "auspicious," and devotees of Lord Siva gradually come to the platform of
spiritual identification, but that is not all. Auspicious life begins from the point of spiritual identification.
But there are still more duties--one has to understand one's relationship with the Supreme Soul. If one is
actually a devotee of Lord Siva, he comes to the platform of spiritual realization, but if he is not intelligent
enough, then he stops at that point, only realizing that he is spirit soul (aham brahmasmi). If he is
intelligent enough, however, he should continue to act in the way of Lord Siva, for Lord Siva is always
absorbed in the thought of Vasudeva. As previously explained, sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam:
Lord Siva is always in meditation on the lotus feet of Vasudeva, Sri Krsna. Thus the auspicious position of
Lord Siva is realized if one takes to the worship of Visnu, because Lord Siva says in the Siva purana that
the topmost worship is worship of Lord Visnu. Lord Siva is worshiped because he is the greatest devotee
of Lord Visnu. One should not, however, make the mistake of considering Lord Siva and Lord Visnu to be
on the same level. That is also an atheistic idea. It is also enjoined in the Vaisnaviya Purana that Visnu, or
Narayana, is the exalted Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one should be compared to Him as
equal, even Lord Siva or Lord Brahma, not to speak of other demigods.
