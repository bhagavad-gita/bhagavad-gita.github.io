<h2>Translation</h2>
The most powerful Lord Brahma, the father of all progenitors; Lord Siva; Manu, Daksa and the other
rulers of humankind; the four saintly first-class brahmacaris headed by Sanaka and Sanatana; the great
sages Marici, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhrgu and Vasistha; and my humble self [Narada] are
all stalwart brahmanas who can speak authoritatively on Vedic literature. We are very powerful because of
austerities, meditation and education. Nonetheless, even after inquiring about the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, whom we always see, we do not know perfectly about Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the foolish Darwinian theory of the anthropologists, it is said that forty thousand years ago
Homo sapiens had not appeared on this planet because the process of evolution had not reached that
point. However, the Vedic histories--the puranas and Mahabharata--relate human histories that extend
millions and millions of years into the past. In the beginning of creation there was a very intelligent
personality, Lord Brahma, and from him emanated all the Manus, and the brahmacaris like Sanaka and
Sanatana, as well as Lord Siva, the great sages and Narada. All these personalities underwent great
austerities and penances and thus became authorities in Vedic knowledge. Perfect knowledge for human
beings, as well as all living entities, is contained in the Vedas. All the above-mentioned great personalities
are not only powerful--being cognizant of past, present and future--but are also devotees. Still, in spite of
their great education in knowledge, and despite their meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord
Visnu, they cannot actually understand the perfection of the living entity's relationship with Lord Visnu.
This means that these personalities are still limited as far as their knowledge of the unlimited is
concerned. The conclusion is that simply by advancing one's knowledge, one cannot be accepted as an
expert in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead can
be understood not by advanced knowledge, but by pure devotional service, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(18.55). Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: unless one takes to pure, transcendental
devotional service, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth. Everyone has
some imperfect ideas about the Lord. So-called scientists and philosophical speculators are unable to
understand the Supreme Lord by virtue of their knowledge. Knowledge is not perfect unless one comes to
the platform of devotional service. This is confirmed by the Vedic version:
athapi te deva padambuja-dvayaprasada-
lesanugrhita eva hi
janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno
na canya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan
(Bhag. 10.14.29)
The speculators, the jnanis, go on speculating about the Supreme Personality of Godhead for many,
many hundreds of thousands of years, but unless one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
one cannot understand His supreme glories. All the great sages mentioned in this verse have their planets
near Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahma resides along with four great sages--Sanaka, Sanatana,
Sanandana and Sanat-kumara. These sages reside in different stars known as the southern stars, which
circle the polestar. The polestar, called Dhruvaloka, is the pivot of this universe, and all planets move
around this polestar. All the stars are planets, as far as we can see, within this one universe. According to
Western theory, all the stars are different suns, but according to Vedic information, there is only one sun
within this universe. All the so-called stars are but different planets. Besides this universe, there are many
millions of other universes, and each of them contains similar innumerable stars and planets.
