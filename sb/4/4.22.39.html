<h2>Translation</h2>
The devotees, who are always engaged in the service of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, can very
easily overcome hard-knotted desires for fruitive activities. Because this is very difficult, the nondevotees--
the jnanis and yogis--although trying to stop the waves of sense gratification, cannot do so. Therefore you
are advised to engage in the devotional service of Krsna, the son of Vasudeva.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three kinds of transcendentalists trying to overcome the influence of the modes of material
nature--the jnanis, yogis and bhaktas. All of them attempt to overcome the influence of the senses, which
is compared to the incessant waves of a river. The waves of a river flow incessantly, and it is very difficult
to stop them. Similarly, the waves of desire for material enjoyment are so strong that they cannot be
stopped by any process other than bhakti-yoga. The bhaktas, by their transcendental devotional service
unto the lotus feet of the Lord, become so overwhelmed with transcendental bliss that automatically their
desires for material enjoyment stop. The jnanis and yogis, who are not attached to the lotus feet of the
Lord, simply struggle against the waves of desire. They are described in this verse as rikta-matayah, which
means "devoid of devotional service." In other words, the jnanis and yogis, although trying to be free from
the desires of material activities, actually become more and more entangled in false philosophical
speculation or strenuous attempts to stop the activities of the senses. As stated previously:
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
(Bhag. 1.2.7)
Here also the same point is stressed. Bhaja vasudevam indicates that one who is engaged in the loving
service of Krsna, the son of Vasudeva, can very easily stop the waves of desires. As long as one continues
to try to artificially stop the waves of desires, he will certainly be defeated. That is indicated in this verse.
Desires for fruitive activities are strongly rooted, but the trees of desire can be uprooted completely by
devotional service because devotional service employs superior desire. One can give up inferior desires
when engaged in superior desires. To try to stop desires is impossible. One has to desire the Supreme in
order not to be entangled in inferior desires. Jnanis maintain a desire to become one with the Supreme,
but such desire is also considered to be kama, lust. Similarly, the yogis desire mystic power, and that is
also kama. And the bhaktas, not being desirous of any sort of material enjoyment, become purified. There
is no artificial attempt to stop desire. Desire becomes a source of spiritual enjoyment under the protection
of the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated herein by the Kumaras that the lotus feet of Lord Krsna
are the ultimate reservoir of all pleasure. One should therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord
instead of trying unsuccessfully to stop desires for material enjoyment. As long as one is unable to stop
the desire for material enjoyment, there is no possibility of becoming liberated from the entanglement of
material existence. It may be argued that the waves of a river are incessantly flowing and that they cannot
be stopped, but the waves of the river flow toward the sea. When the tide comes over the river, it
overwhelms the flowing of the river, and the river itself becomes overflooded, and the waves from the sea
become more prominent than the waves from the river. Similarly, a devotee with intelligence plans so
many things for the service of the Lord in Krsna consciousness that stagnant material desires become
overflooded by the desire to serve the Lord. As confirmed by Yamunacarya, since he has been engaged in
the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is always a current of newer and newer desires flowing to
serve the Lord, so much so that the stagnant desire of sex life becomes very insignificant. Yamunacarya
even says that he spits on such desires. Bhagavad-gita (2.59) also confirms: param drstva nivartate. The
conclusion is that by developing a loving desire for the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, we subdue all
material desires for sense gratification.
