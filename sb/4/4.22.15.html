<h2>Translation</h2>
When all the sons of Pracinabarhi left home to execute austerities, they met Lord Siva, who, out of great
mercy, instructed them about the Absolute Truth. All the sons of Pracinabarhi meditated upon the
instructions, chanting and worshiping them with great care and attention.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is clear that to perform austerities or penances, or, for that matter, any form of devotional service, one
has to be guided by a spiritual master. Here it is clearly stated that the ten sons of Maharaja Pracinabarhi
were favored by the appearance of Lord Siva, who, out of great kindness, gave them instructions regarding
the execution of austerities. Lord Siva actually became the spiritual master of the ten sons, and in turn his
disciples took his words so seriously that simply by meditating upon his instructions (dhyayantah) they
became perfect. This is the secret of success. After being initiated and receiving the orders of the spiritual
master, the disciple should unhesitatingly think about the instructions or orders of the spiritual master
and should not allow himself to be disturbed by anything else. This is also the verdict of Srila Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura, who, while explaining a verse of Bhagavad-gita (vyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kurunandana,
Bg. 2.41), points out that the order of the spiritual master is the life substance of the disciple.
The disciple should not consider whether he is going back home, back to Godhead; his first business
should be to execute the order of his spiritual master. Thus a disciple should always meditate on the order
of the spiritual master, and that is perfectional meditation. Not only should he meditate upon that order,
but he should find out the means by which he can perfectly worship and execute it.
