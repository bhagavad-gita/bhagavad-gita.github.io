<h2>Text</h2>
tasya me tad-anusthanad
yan ahur brahma-vadinah
lokah syuh kama-sandoha
yasya tusyati dista-drk
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--his; me--mine; tat--that; anusthanat--by executing; yan--that which; ahuh--is spoken; brahmavadinah--
by the experts in Vedic knowledge; lokah--planets; syuh--become; kama-sandohah--fulfilling
one's desirable objectives; yasya--whose; tusyati--becomes satisfied; dista-drk--the seer of all destiny.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Prthu said: I think that upon the execution of my duties as king, I shall be able to achieve the
desirable objectives described by experts in Vedic knowledge. This destination is certainly achieved by the
pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the seer of all destiny.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Prthu gives special stress to the word brahma-vadinah ("by the experts in the Vedic
knowledge"). Brahma refers to the Vedas, which are also known as sabda-brahma, or transcendental
sound. Transcendental sound is not ordinary language, although it appears to be written in ordinary
language. Evidence from the Vedic literature should be accepted as final authority. In the Vedic literature
there is much information, and of course there is information about the execution of a king's duty. A
responsible king who executes his appointed duty by giving proper protection to all living entities on his
planet is promoted to the heavenly planetary system. This is also dependent upon the pleasure of the
Supreme Lord. It is not that if one executes his duty properly he is automatically promoted, for promotion
depends upon the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It must ultimately be concluded
that one can achieve the desired result of his activities upon satisfying the Supreme Lord. This is also
confirmed in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of Srimad-Bhagavatam:
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
The perfection of one's execution of his appointed duties is the ultimate satisfaction of the Supreme
Lord. The word kama-sandohah means "achievement of the desired result." Everyone desires to achieve
the ultimate goal of life, but in modern civilization the great scientists think that man's life has no plan.
This gross ignorance is very dangerous and makes civilization very risky. People do not know the laws of
nature, which are the rulings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are atheists of the first
order, they have no faith in the existence of God and His rulings and therefore do not know how nature is
working. This gross ignorance of the mass of people, including even the so-called scientists and
philosophers, makes life a risky situation in which human beings do not know whether they are making
progress in life. According to Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.30), they are simply progressing to the darkest
region of material existence. Adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram. The Krsna consciousness movement has
therefore been started to give philosophers, scientists, and people in general the proper knowledge about
the destiny of life. Everyone should take advantage of this movement and learn the real goal of life.
