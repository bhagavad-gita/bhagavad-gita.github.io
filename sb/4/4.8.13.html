<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, O Supreme Unborn, I know that the different varieties of living entities, such as animals,
trees, birds, reptiles, demigods and human beings, are spread throughout the universe, which is caused by
the total material energy, and I know that they are sometimes manifest and sometimes unmanifest; but I
have never experienced the supreme form I behold as I see You now. Now all kinds of methods of
theorizing have come to an end.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He has spread Himself throughout the universe, but although
everything is resting upon Him, He is aloof. The same concept is expressed here by Dhruva Maharaja. He
states that before seeing the transcendental form of the Lord, he had experienced only the varieties of
material forms, which are counted at one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, it is impossible to
understand the ultimate form of the Lord. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (18.55). Bhaktya
mam abhijanati: factual understanding of the Absolute Truth, who is the Supreme Person, cannot be
obtained by any process other than devotional service.
Dhruva Maharaja here compares his previous state of understanding with the perfection of
understanding in the presence of the Supreme Lord. The position of a living entity is to render service;
unless he comes to the stage of appreciating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he engages in the
service of the various forms of trees, reptiles, animals, Men, demigods, etc. One can experience that one
man engages in the service of a dog, another serves plants and creepers, another the demigods, and
another humanity, or his boss in the office--but no one is engaged in the service of Krsna. Aside from
common men, even men who are elevated in terms of spiritual understanding are at the utmost engaged
in the service of the virat-rupa, or, unable to understand the ultimate form of the Lord, they worship
voidism by meditation. Dhruva Maharaja, however, had been blessed by the Supreme Lord. When the
Lord touched His conchshell to Dhruva's forehead, real knowledge was revealed from within, and Dhruva
could understand the Lord's transcendental form. Dhruva Maharaja here admits that not only was he
ignorant, but by years he was only a child. It would not have been possible for an ignorant child to
appreciate the supreme form of the Lord had he not been blessed by the Lord, who had touched His
conchshell to Dhruva's forehead.
