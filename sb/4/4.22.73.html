<h2>Text</h2>
te vayam noditah sarve
praja-sarge prajesvarah
anena dhvasta-tamasah
sisrksmo vividhah prajah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
te--by him; vayam--all of us; noditah--ordered; sarve--all; praja-sarge--at the time of creating population;
praja-isvarah--the controllers of all living entities; anena--by this; dhvasta-tamasah--being freed from all
kinds of ignorance; sisrksmah--we created; vividhah--various kinds of; prajah--living entities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When all the Prajapatis were ordered to create by Lord Brahma, we chanted these prayers in praise of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and became completely free from all ignorance. Thus we were able
to create different types of living entities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse we can understand that the various types of living entities were created simultaneously at
the very beginning of the creation. The nonsensical Darwinian theory of evolution is not applicable here.
It is not that intelligent human beings did not exist millions of years ago. On the contrary, it is understood
that the most intelligent creature, Lord Brahma, was first created. Then Lord Brahma created other saintly
sages like Marici, Bhrgu, Atreya, Vasistha and Lord Siva. They in their turn created different types of
bodies according to karma. In Srimad-Bhagavatam Lord Kapiladeva told His mother that the living entity
gets a particular type of body in accordance with his work and that this body is decided upon by higher
authorities. The higher authorities, as appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are Lord
Brahma and all other Prajapatis and Manus. Thus from the beginning of creation it can be seen that the
first creature is the most intelligent. It is not that so-called modern intelligence has developed by the
gradual process of evolution. As stated in Brahma-vaivarta purana, there is a gradual evolutionary process,
but it is not the body that is evolving. All the bodily forms are already there. It is the spiritual entity, or
spiritual spark within the body, that is being promoted by the laws of nature under the supervision of
superior authority. We can understand from this verse that from the very beginning of creation different
varieties of living entities were existing. It is not that some of them have become extinct. Everything is
there; it is due to our lack of knowledge that we cannot see things in their proper perspective.
In this verse the word dhvasta-tamasah is very important, for without being free of ignorance one
cannot control the creation of different types of living entities. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.31.1),
daiva-netrena--bodies are awarded under the supervision of superior powers. How can these superior
powers control the evolutionary process of the living entity if they are not free from all imperfection? The
followers of the Vedic instructions cannot accept the Darwinian theory of evolution, for it is marred by
imperfect knowledge.
