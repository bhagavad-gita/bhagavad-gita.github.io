<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
akutim rucaye pradad
api bhratrmatim nrpah
putrika-dharmam asritya
satarupanumoditah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
akutim--Akuti; rucaye--unto the great sage Ruci; pradat--handed over; api--although; bhratr-matim--
daughter having a brother; nrpah--the King; putrika--get the resultant son; dharmam--religious rites;
asritya--taking shelter; satarupa--by the wife of Svayambhuva Manu; anumoditah--being sanctioned.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Akuti had two brothers, but in spite of her brothers, King Svayambhuva Manu handed her over to
Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son born of her be returned to Manu as his son. This he did in
consultation with his wife, Satarupa.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes a sonless person offers his daughter to a husband on the condition that his grandson be
returned to him to be adopted as his son and inherit his property. This is called putrika-dharma, which
means that by execution of religious rituals one gets a son, although one is sonless by one's own wife. But
here we see extraordinary behavior in Manu, for in spite of his having two sons, he handed over his first
daughter to Prajapati Ruci on the condition that the son born of his daughter be returned to him as his
son. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments in this connection that King Manu knew that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead would take birth in the womb of Akuti; therefore, in spite of having two
sons, he wanted the particular son born of Akuti because he was ambitious to have the Supreme
Personality of Godhead appear as his son and grandson. Manu is the lawgiver of mankind, and since he
personally executed the putrika-dharma, we may accept that such a system may be adopted by mankind
also. Thus, even though one has a son, if one wants to have a particular son from one's daughter, one may
give one's daughter in charity on that condition. That is the opinion of Srila Jiva Gosvami.
