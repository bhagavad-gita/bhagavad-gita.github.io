<h2>Text</h2>
sreyasam iha sarvesam
jnanam nihsreyasam param
sukham tarati dusparam
jnana-naur vyasanarnavam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sreyasam--of all benedictions; iha--in this world; sarvesam--of every person; jnanam--knowledge;
nihsreyasam--the supreme benefit; param--transcendental; sukham--happiness; tarati--crosses over;
dusparam--insurmountable; jnana--knowledge; nauh--boat; vyasana--danger; arnavam--the ocean.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this material world there are different types of achievement, but of all of them the achievement of
knowledge is considered to be the highest because one can cross the ocean of nescience only on the boat
of knowledge. Otherwise the ocean is impassable.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually everyone is suffering within this material world due to ignorance. Every day we see that a
person without knowledge commits some criminal act and is later arrested and punished, despite the fact
that he actually may not have been conscious of his sinful activity. Such ignorance prevails throughout
the world. People do not consider how they are risking their lives in an attempt to have illicit sex life, kill
animals to satisfy their tongue, enjoy intoxication and gamble. It is very regrettable that the leaders of the
world do not know of the effects of these sinful activities. They are instead taking things very easily and
are succeeding in making the ocean of nescience wider and wider.
Opposed to such ignorance, full knowledge is the greatest achievement within this material world. We
can practically see that one who has sufficient knowledge is saved from many dangerous pitfalls in life. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.19), bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate: "When one actually
becomes wise, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Vasudevah sarvam iti sa
mahatma sudurlabhah: "Such a great soul is very rarely to be found."
This Krsna consciousness movement is determined to open wide the eyes of the so-called leaders, who
are full of ignorance, and thus save them from the many pitfalls and dangerous conditions of life. The
greatest danger is the danger of getting a body lower than that of a human being. It was with great
difficulty that we attained this human form of life just to take advantage of this body and reestablish our
relationship with the Supreme personality of Godhead, Govinda. Lord Siva advises, however, that those
who take advantage of his prayers will very soon become devotees of Lord Vasudeva and thus will be able
to cross the ocean of nescience and make life perfect.
