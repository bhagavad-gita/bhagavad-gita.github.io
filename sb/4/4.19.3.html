<h2>Text</h2>
sudhiyah sadhavo loke
naradeva narottamah
nabhidruhyanti bhutebhyo
yarhi natma kalevaram
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
su-dhiyah--the most intelligent persons; sadhavah--who are inclined to perform welfare activities; loke--
in this world; nara-deva--O King; nara-uttamah--the best of human beings; na abhidruhyanti--never
become malicious; bhutebhyah--toward other living beings; yarhi--because; na--never; atma--the self or
soul; kalevaram--this body.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, one who is advanced in intelligence and eager to perform welfare activities for others is
considered best amongst human beings. An advanced human being is never malicious to others. Those
with advanced intelligence are always conscious that this material body is different from the soul.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In daily life we find that when a madman commits murder, he is excused even by a high-court judge.
The idea is that a living entity is always pure because he is part and parcel of the Supreme personality of
Godhead. When he falls into the clutches of material energy, he becomes a victim of the three modes of
material nature. Indeed, whatever he does, he does under the influence of material nature. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (5.14):
na kartrtvam na karmani
lokasya srjati prabhuh
na karma-phala-samyogam
svabhavas tu pravartate
"The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce
people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature."
Actually the living entity, or soul, does not do anything; everything is done under the influence of the
modes of material nature. When a man is diseased, the symptoms of the disease become a source of all
kinds of pain. Those who are advanced in transcendental consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, are
never envious, neither of the soul nor of the activities of the soul under the influence of material nature.
Advanced transcendentalists are called sudhiyah. Sudhi means "intelligence," sudhi means "highly
advanced," and sudhi means "devotee." One who is both devoted and highly advanced in intelligence
does not take action against the soul or the body. If there is any discrepancy, he forgives. It is said that
forgiveness is a quality of those who are advancing in spiritual knowledge.
