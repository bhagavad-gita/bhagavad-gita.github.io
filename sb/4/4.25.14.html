gandharvyas tadrsir asya
maithunyas ca sitasitah
parivrttya vilumpanti
sarva-kama-vinirmitam
SYNONYMS
gandharvyah--Gandharvis; tadrsih--similarly; asya--of Candavega; maithunyah--companions for sexual
intercourse; ca--also; sita--white; asitah--black; parivrttya--by surrounding; vilumpanti--they plundered;
sarva-kama--all kinds of desirable objects; vinirmitam--manufactured.
TRANSLATION
Along with Candavega were as many female Gandharvis as there were soldiers, and all of them
repetitively plundered all the paraphernalia for sense enjoyment.
PURPORT
The days have been compared to the soldiers of Candavega. Night is generally a time for sex enjoyment.
Days are considered to be white, and nights are considered to be black, or, from another point of view,
there are two kinds of nights--black nights and white nights. All these days and nights combine to pass
away our span of life and everything we manufacture for sense gratification. Material activity means
manufacturing things for sense gratification. Scientists are conducting research to find out how we can
satisfy our senses more and more elaborately. In this Kali-yuga, the demoniac mentality is employed in
manufacturing various machines to facilitate the process of sense gratification. There are so many
machines for ordinary household activities. There are machines for washing dishes, cleansing the floor,
shaving, clipping hair--today everything is done by machine. All these facilities for sense gratification are
described in this verse as sarva-kama-vinirmitam. The time factor, however, is so strong that not only is
our span of life being expended, but all the machines and facilities for sense gratification are deteriorating.
Therefore in this verse the word vilumpanti ("plundering") is used. Everything is being plundered from
the very beginning of our lives.
This plundering of our possessions and life-span begins with the day of our birth. One day will come
when death will finish everything, and the living entity will have to enter another body to begin another
chapter of life and again begin the cycle of material sense gratification. Prahlada Maharaja describes this
process as punah punas carvita-carvananam (Bhag. 7.5.30). Materialistic life means chewing the chewed
again and again. The central point of material life is sense gratification. In different types of bodies, the
living entity enjoys various senses, and through creating various types of facilities, he chews the chewed.
Whether we squeeze sugar out of the sugarcane with our teeth or a machine, the result is the same--
sugarcane juice. We may discover many ways to squeeze the juice out of the sugarcane, but the result is
the same.
