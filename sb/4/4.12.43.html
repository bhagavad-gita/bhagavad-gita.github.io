TRANSLATION
Dhruva Maharaja attained an exalted position at the age of only five or six years, after undergoing
austerity for six months. Alas, a great ksatriya cannot achieve such a position even after undergoing
austerities for many, many years.
PURPORT
Dhruva Maharaja is described herein as ksatra-bandhuh, which indicates that he was not fully trained as
a ksatriya because he was only five years old; he was not a mature ksatriya. A ksatriya or brahmana has to
take training. A boy born in the family of a brahmana is not immediately a brahmana; he has to take up
the training and the purificatory process.
The great sage Narada Muni was very proud of having a devotee-disciple like Dhruva Maharaja. He had
many other disciples, but he was very pleased with Dhruva Maharaja because in one lifetime, by dint of
his severe penances and austerities, he had achieved Vaikuntha, which was never achieved by any other
king's son or rajarsi throughout the whole universe. There is the instance of the great King Bharata, who
was also a great devotee, but he attained Vaikunthaloka in three lives. In the first life, although he
executed austerities in the forest, he became a victim of too much affection for a small deer, and in his
next life he had to take birth as a deer. Although he had a deer's body, he remembered his spiritual
position, but he still had to wait until the next life for perfection. In the next life he took birth as Jada
Bharata. Of course, in that life he was completely freed from all material entanglement, and he attained
perfection and was elevated to Vaikunthaloka. The lesson from the life of Dhruva Maharaja is that if one
likes, one can attain Vaikunthaloka in one life, without waiting for many other lives. My Guru Maharaja,
Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada, used to say that every one of his disciples
could attain Vaikunthaloka in this life, without waiting for another life to execute devotional service. One
simply has to become as serious and sincere as Dhruva Maharaja; then it is quite possible to attain
Vaikunthaloka and go back home, back to Godhead, in one life.
