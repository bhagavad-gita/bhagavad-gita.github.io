TRANSLATION
Thereafter Sati left her husband, Lord Siva, who had given her half his body due to affection. Breathing
very heavily because of anger and bereavement, she went to the house of her father. This less intelligent
act was due to her being a weak woman.
PURPORT
According to the Vedic conception of family life, the husband gives half his body to his wife, and the
wife gives half of her body to her husband. In other words, a husband without a wife or a wife without a
husband is incomplete. Vedic marital relationship existed between Lord Siva and Sati, but sometimes, due
to weakness, a woman becomes very much attracted by the members of her father's house, and this
happened to Sati. In this verse it is specifically mentioned that she wanted to leave such a great husband
as Siva because of her womanly weakness. In other words, womanly weakness exists even in the
relationship between husband and wife. Generally, separation between husband and wife is due to
womanly behavior; divorce takes place due to womanly weakness. The best course for a woman is to
abide by the orders of her husband. That makes family life very peaceful. Sometimes there may be
misunderstandings between husband and wife, as found even in such an elevated family relationship as
that of Sati and Lord Siva, but a wife should not leave her husband's protection because of such a
misunderstanding. If she does so, it is understood to be due to her womanly weakness.
