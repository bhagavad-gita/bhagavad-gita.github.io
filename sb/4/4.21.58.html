<h2>Text</h2>
varsati sma yatha-kamam
parjanya iva tarpayan
samudra iva durbodhah
sattvenacala-rad iva
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
varsati--pouring; sma--used to; yatha-kamam--as much as one can desire; parjanyah--water; iva--like;
tarpayan--pleasing; samudrah--the sea; iva--likened; durbodhah--not understandable; sattvena--by
existential position; acala--the hills; rat iva--like the king of.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as rainfall satisfies everyone's desires, Maharaja Prthu used to satisfy everyone. He was like the sea
in that no one could understand his depths, and he was like Meru, the king of hills, in the fixity of his
purpose.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Prthu used to distribute his mercy to suffering humanity, and it was like rainfall after
excessive heat. The ocean is wide and expansive, and it is very difficult to measure its length and breadth;
similarly, Prthu Maharaja was so deep and grave that no one could fathom his purposes. The hill known
as Meru is fixed in the universe as a universal pivot, and no one can move it an inch from its position;
similarly, no one could ever dissuade Maharaja Prthu when he was determined.
