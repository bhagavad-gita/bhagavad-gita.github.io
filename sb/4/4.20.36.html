<h2>Text</h2>
aho mamami vitaranty anugraham
harim gurum yajna-bhujam adhisvaram
sva-dharma-yogena yajanti mamaka
nirantaram ksoni-tale drdha-vratah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--O all of you; mama--unto me; ami--all of them; vitaranti--distributing; anugraham--mercy; harim--
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; gurum--the supreme spiritual master; yajna-bhujam--all the
demigods eligible to accept yajna offerings; adhisvaram--the supreme master; sva-dharma--occupational
duties; yogena--by dint of; yajanti--worship; mamakah--having a relationship with me; nirantaram--
incessantly; ksoni-tale--on the surface of the globe; drdha-vratah--with firm determination.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master and enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices, and He is
the supreme spiritual master as well. All of you citizens on the surface of the globe who have a
relationship with me and are worshiping Him by dint of your occupational duties are bestowing your
mercy upon me. Therefore, O my citizens, I thank you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Prthu's advice to his citizens to take to devotional service is now concluded in two ways. He
has repeatedly advised persons who are neophytes to engage themselves in devotional service according to
the capacities of the different orders of social and spiritual life, but here he specifically thanks those
already engaged in such devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is actually the
enjoyer of all sacrificial ceremonies and who is also the supreme teacher as antaryami, or Paramatma.
There is specific mention of the word gurum, which indicates the Supreme Personality as caitya-guru. The
Supreme Godhead in His Paramatma feature is present in everyone's heart, and He is always trying to
induce the individual soul to surrender unto Him and to engage in devotional service; therefore He is the
original spiritual master. He manifests Himself as spiritual master both internally and externally to help
the conditioned soul both ways. Therefore He has been mentioned herein as gurum. It appears, however,
that in the time of Maharaja Prthu all the people on the surface of the globe were his subjects. Most of
them--in fact, almost all of them--were engaged in devotional service. Therefore he thanked them in a
humble way for engaging in devotional service and thus bestowing their mercy upon him. In other words,
in a state where the citizens and the head of state are engaged in devotional service unto the Supreme
personality of Godhead, they help one another and are mutually benefited.
