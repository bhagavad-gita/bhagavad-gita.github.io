<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
ayam tu deva-yajana
indropendradibhir bhavah
saha bhagam na labhatam
devair deva-ganadhamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ayam--that; tu--but; deva-yajane--in the sacrifice of the demigods; indra-upendra-adibhih--with Indra,
Upendra and the others; bhavah--Siva; saha--along with; bhagam--a portion; na--not; labhatam--should
obtain; devaih--with the demigods; deva-gana-adhamah--the lowest of all the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods are eligible to share in the oblations of sacrifice, but Lord Siva, who is the lowest of all the
demigods, should not have a share.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because of this curse, Siva was deprived of his share in the oblations of Vedic sacrifices. It was due to
the curse of Daksa, Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti comments in this connection, that Lord Siva was saved from
the calamity of taking part with other demigods, who were all materialistic. Lord Siva is the greatest
devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it is not fitting for him to eat or sit with materialistic
persons like the demigods. Thus the curse of Daksa was indirectly a blessing, for Siva would not have to
eat or sit with other demigods, who were too materialistic. There is a practical example set for us by
Gaurakisora dasa Babaji Maharaja, who used to sit on the side of a latrine to chant Hare Krsna. Many
materialistic persons used to come and bother him and disturb his daily routine of chanting, so to avoid
their company he used to sit by the side of a latrine, where materialistic persons would not go because of
the filth and the obnoxious smell. However, Gaurakisora dasa Babaji Maharaja was so great that he was
accepted as the spiritual master of such a great personality as His Divine Grace Om Visnupada Sri Srimad
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja. The conclusion is that Lord Siva behaved in his own way to
avoid materialistic persons who might disturb him in his prosecution of devotional service.
