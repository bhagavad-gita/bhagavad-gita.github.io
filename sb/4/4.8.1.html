<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya told Vidura: When the demigods were thus reassured by the Personality of
Godhead, they were freed from all fears, and after offering their obeisances, they returned to their
heavenly planets. Then the Lord, who is nondifferent from the Sahasrasirsa incarnation, got on the back
of Garuda, who carried Him to the Madhuvana Forest to see His servant Dhruva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word sahasrasirsa refers to the Personality of Godhead known as Garbhodakasayi Visnu. Although
the Lord appeared as Ksirodakasayi Visnu, He has been described here as Sahasrasirsa Visnu because He is
nondifferent from Garbhodakasayi Visnu. According to Srila Sanatana Gosvami in his Bhagavatamrta, the
Sahasrasirsa Personality of Godhead who appeared at that time was the incarnation known as
Prsnigarbha. He created the planet known as Dhruvaloka for the habitation of Dhruva Maharaja.
