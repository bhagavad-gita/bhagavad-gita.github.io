<h2>Translation</h2>
Prthu Maharaja continued: How can such persons, who have rendered unlimited service by explaining
the path of self-realization in relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whose explanations are
given for our enlightenment with complete conviction and Vedic evidence, be repaid except by folded
palms containing water for their satisfaction? Such great personalities can be satisfied only by their own
activities, which are distributed amongst human society out of their unlimited mercy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Great personalities of the material world are very eager to render welfare service to human society, but
actually no one can render better service than one who distributes the knowledge of spiritual realization
in relation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All living entities are within the clutches of the
illusory energy. Forgetting their real identity, they hover in material existence, transmigrating from one
body to another in search of a peaceful life. Since these living entities have very little knowledge of selfrealization,
they are not getting any relief, although they are very anxious to attain peace of mind and
some substantial happiness. Saintly persons like the Kumaras, Narada, Prahlada, Janaka, Sukadeva
Gosvami and Kapiladeva, as well as the followers of such authorities as the Vaisnava acaryas and their
servants, can render a valuable service to humanity by disseminating knowledge of the relationship
between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity. Such knowledge is the perfect
benediction for humanity.
Knowledge of Krsna is such a great gift that it is impossible to repay the benefactor. Therefore Prthu
Maharaja requested the Kumaras to be satisfied by their own benevolent activities in delivering souls from
the clutches of maya. The King saw that there was no other way to satisfy them for their exalted activities.
The word vinoda-patram can be divided into two words, vina and uda-patram, or can be understood as
one word, vinoda-patram, which means "joker." A joker's activities simply arouse laughter, and a person
who tries to repay the spiritual master or teacher of the transcendental message of Krsna becomes a
laughingstock just like a joker because it is not possible to repay such a debt. The best friend and
benefactor of all people is one who awakens humanity to its original Krsna consciousness.
