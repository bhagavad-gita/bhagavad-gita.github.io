<h2>Translation</h2>
Once, while wandering in this way, he saw on the southern side of the Himalayas, in a place named
Bharata-varsa [India], a city that had nine gates all about and was characterized by all auspicious facilities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The tract of land south of the Himalaya Mountains is the land of India, which was known as Bharatavarsa.
When a living entity takes birth in Bharata-varsa he is considered to be most fortunate. Indeed,
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has stated:
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
(Cc. Adi 9.41)
Thus whoever takes birth in the land of Bharata-varsa attains all the facilities of life. He may take
advantage of all these facilities for both material and spiritual advancement and thus make his life
successful. After attaining the goal of life, one may distribute his knowledge and experience all over the
world for humanitarian purposes. In other words, one who takes birth in the land of Bharata-varsa by
virtue of his past pious activities gets full facility to develop the human form of life. In India, the climatic
condition is such that one can live very peacefully without being disturbed by material conditions. Indeed,
during the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira or Lord Ramacandra, people were free from all anxieties. There
was not even extreme cold or extreme heat. The three kinds of miserable conditions--adhyatmika,
adhibhautika and adhidaivika (miseries inflicted by the body and mind itself, those inflicted by other
living entities, and natural disturbances)--were all absent during the reign of Lord Ramacandra or
Maharaja Yudhisthira. But at present, compared to other countries on earth, India is artificially disturbed.
Despite these material disturbances, however, the country's culture is such that one can easily attain the
goal of life--namely salvation, or liberation from material bondage. Thus in order to take birth in India
one must have performed many pious activities in a past life.
In this verse the word laksita-laksanam indicates that the human body attained in Bharata-varsa is very
auspicious. Vedic culture is full of knowledge, and a person born in India can fully take advantage of
Vedic cultural knowledge and the cultural system known as varnasrama-dharma. Even at the present
time, as we travel all over the world, we see that in some countries human beings have many material
facilities but no facilities for spiritual advancement. We find everywhere the defects of one-sided facilities
and a lack of full facilities. A blind man can walk but not see, and a lame man cannot walk but can see.
Andha-pangu-nyaya. The blind man may take the lame man over his shoulder, and as he walks the lame
man may give him directions. Thus combined they may work, but individually neither the blind man nor
the lame man can walk successfully. Similarly, this human form of life is meant for the advancement of
spiritual life and for keeping the material necessities in order. Especially in the Western countries there
are ample facilities for material comforts, but no one has any idea of spiritual advancement. Many are
hankering after spiritual advancement, but many cheaters come, take advantage of their money, bluff
them and go away. Fortunately the Krsna consciousness movement is there to give all facilities for both
material and spiritual advancement. In this way people in the Western countries may take advantage of
this movement. In India any man in the villages, unaffected by the industrial cities of India, can still live
in any condition and make spiritual advancement. The body has been called the city of nine gates, and
these nine gates include two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, a genital and a rectum. When the
nine gates are clean and working properly, it is to be understood that the body is healthy. In India these
nine gates are kept clean by the villagers who rise early in the morning, bathe in the well or rivers, go to
the temples to attend mangala-arati, chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and take prasada. In this way one
can take advantage of all the facilities of human life. We are gradually introducing this system in different
centers in our Society in the Western countries. One who takes advantage of it becomes more and more
enlightened in spiritual life. At the present moment, India may be compared to the lame man and the
Western countries to the blind man. For the past two thousand years India has been subjugated by the
rule of foreigners, and the legs of progress have been broken. In the Western countries the eyes of the
people have become blind due to the dazzling glitter of material opulence. The blind man of the Western
countries and the lame man of India should combine together in this Krsna consciousness movement.
Then the lame man of India can walk with the help of the Westerner, and the blind Westerner can see
with the help of the lame man. In short, the material advancement of the Western countries and the
spiritual assets of India should combine for the elevation of all human society.
