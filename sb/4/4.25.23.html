<h2>Text</h2>
pasuvad yavanair esa
niyamanah svakam ksayam
anvadravann anupathah
socanto bhrsam aturah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pasu-vat--like an animal; yavanaih--by the Yavanas; esah--Puranjana; niyamanah--being arrested and
taken away; svakam--to their own; ksayam--abode; anvadravan--followed; anupathah--his attendants;
socantah--lamenting; bhrsam--greatly; aturah--being distressed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Yavanas were taking King Puranjana away to their place, binding him like an animal, the
King's followers became greatly aggrieved. While they lamented, they were forced to go along with him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Yamaraja and his assistants take a living entity away to the place of judgment, the life, life air and
desires, being followers of the living entity, also go with him. This is confirmed in the Vedas. When the
living entity is taken away or arrested by Yamaraja (tam utkramantam), the life air also goes with him
(prano 'nutkramati), and when the life air is gone (pranam anutkramantam), all the senses (sarve pranah)
also go along (anutkramanti). When the living entity and the life air are gone, the lump of matter
produced of five elements--earth, water, air, fire and ether--is rejected and left behind. The living entity
then goes to the court of judgment, and Yamaraja decides what kind of body he is going to get next. This
process is unknown to modern scientists. Every living entity is responsible for his activities in this life,
and after death he is taken to the court of Yamaraja, where it is decided what kind of body he will take
next. Although the gross material body is left, the living entity and his desires, as well as the resultant
reactions of his past activities, go on. It is Yamaraja who decides what kind of body one gets next in
accordance with one's past actions.
