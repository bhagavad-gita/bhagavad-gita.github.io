<h2>Text</h2>
antahpura-striyo 'prcchad
vimana iva vedisat
api vah kusalam ramah
sesvarinam yatha pura
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
antah-pura--household; striyah--women; aprcchat--he asked; vimanah--being very much anxious; iva--
like; vedisat--O King Pracinabarhi; api--whether; vah--your; kusalam--good fortune; ramah--O you
beautiful women; sa-isvarinam--with your mistress; yatha--as; pura--before.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
At that time King Puranjana was a little anxious, and he inquired from the household women: My dear
beautiful women, are you and your mistress all very happy like before, or not?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word vedisat indicates King Pracinabarhi. When a man becomes refreshed by
association with devotees and awakes to Krsna consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind--
namely thinking, feeling and willing--and decides whether he should return to his material activities or
stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word kusalam refers to that which is auspicious. One can make
his home perfectly auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Visnu. When one is engaged
in activities other than visnu-bhakti, or in other words when one is engaged in material activities, he is
always filled with anxieties. A sane man should consult his mind, its thinking, feeling and willing
processes, and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of Krsna, feels how to
serve Him and wills to execute the order of Krsna, it should be known that he has taken good instruction
from his intelligence, which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless
inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how he could return to his steady
good consciousness. The mind may suggest that by visaya-bhoga, or sense enjoyment, one can become
happy, but when one becomes advanced in Krsna consciousness, he does not derive happiness from
material activities. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (2.59):
visaya vinivartante
niraharasya dehinah
rasa-varjam raso 'py asya
param drstva nivartate
"The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains.
But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness." One cannot
be unattached to the sense objects unless he finds better engagement in devotional service. param drstva
nivartate. One can cease from material activities only when one actually engages in devotional service.
