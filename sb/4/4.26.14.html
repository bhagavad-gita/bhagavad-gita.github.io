<h2>Translation</h2>
The city called Gramaka, which is approached through the lower gate of Asuri [the genital], is meant for
sex, which is very pleasing to common men who are simply fools and rascals. The faculty of procreation is
called Durmada, and the rectum is called Nirrti.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the world becomes degraded, civilization becomes demoniac, and for the common man the
rectum and the genital are taken very seriously as the centers of all activity. Even in such a sacred place as
Vrndavana, India, unintelligent men pass off this rectal and genital business as spiritual activity. Such
people are called sahajiya. According to their philosophy, through sexual indulgence one can elevate
oneself to the spiritual platform. From these verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, we understand that
the desires for sexual satisfaction are meant for the arvak, the lowest among men. To rectify these rascals
and fools is very difficult. After all, the sex desires of the common man are condemned in these verses.
The word durmada means "wrongly directed," and nirrti means "sinful activity." Although this clearly
indicates that sex indulgence is abominable and misdirected even from the ordinary point of view, the
sahajiyas nonetheless pass themselves off as devotees conducting spiritual activities. For this reason,
Vrndavana is no longer visited by intelligent men. Sometimes we are often asked why we have made our
center in Vrndavana. From the external point of view, it can be concluded that Vrndavana has become
degenerate due to these sahajiya activities, yet from the spiritual point of view, Vrndavana is the only
place where all these sinful persons can be rectified by means of taking birth in the forms of dogs, hogs
and monkeys. By living in Vrndavana as a dog, hog or monkey, the living entity can be elevated to the
spiritual platform in the next life.
