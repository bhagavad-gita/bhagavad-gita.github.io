<h2>Translation</h2>
By regularly discharging devotional service, Prthu Maharaja became transcendental in mind and could
therefore constantly think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Because of this, he became completely detached
and attained perfect knowledge by which he could transcend all doubt. Thus he was freed from the
clutches of false ego and the material conception of life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Narada-pancaratra, devotional service to the Lord is likened unto a queen. When a queen gives an
audience, many maidservants follow her. The maidservants of devotional service are material opulence,
liberation and mystic powers. The karmis are very much attached to material enjoyment, the jnanis are
very anxious to become freed from material clutches, and the yogis are very fond of attaining the eight
kinds of mystic perfection. From the Narada-pancaratra we understand that if one attains the stage of pure
devotional service, he also attains all the opulences derived from fruitive activities, empiric philosophical
speculation and mystic yogic practice. Srila Bilvamangala Thakura therefore prayed in his Krsnakarnamrta:
"My dear Lord, if I have unflinching devotion to You, You become manifest before me
personally, and the results of fruitive activity and empiric philosophical speculation--namely religion,
economic development, sense gratification and liberation--become like personal attendants and remain
standing before me as if awaiting my order." The idea here is that the jnanis, by culture of brahma-vidya,
spiritual knowledge, struggle very hard to get out of the clutches of material nature, but a devotee, by dint
of his advancement in devotional service, automatically becomes detached from his material body. When
the devotee's spiritual body begins to manifest, he actually enters into his activities in transcendental life.
At present we have contacted a material body, material mind and material intelligence, but when we
become free from these material conditions, our spiritual body, spiritual mind and spiritual intelligence
become manifest. In that transcendental state, a devotee attains all the benefits of karma, jnana and yoga.
Although he never engages in fruitive activities or empiric speculation to attain mystic powers,
automatically mystic powers appear in his service. A devotee does not want any kind of material opulence,
but such opulence appears before him automatically. He does not have to endeavor for it. Because of his
devotional service, he automatically becomes brahma-bhuta. As stated before, this is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who is engaged in full devotional service, unfailing in all circumstances, at once transcends the
modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."
Because of his regular discharge of devotional service, a devotee attains the transcendental stage of life.
Since his mind is transcendentally situated, he cannot think of anything but the lotus feet of the Lord.
This is the meaning of the word samsmarana-anupurtya. By constantly thinking of the lotus feet of the
Lord, the devotee immediately becomes situated in suddha-sattva. Suddha-sattva refers to that platform
which is above the modes of material nature, including the mode of goodness. In the material world, the
mode of goodness is considered to be representative of the highest perfection, but one has to transcend
this mode and come to the stage of suddha-sattva, or pure goodness, where the three qualities of material
nature cannot act.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the following example: If one has strong digestive power,
after eating he automatically lights a fire within his stomach to digest everything and does not need to
take medicine to aid his digestion. Similarly, the fire of devotional service is so strong that a devotee does
not need to act separately to attain perfect knowledge or detachment from material attractions. A jnani
may become detached from material attractions by prolonged discussions on subjects of knowledge and
may in this way finally come to the brahma-bhuta stage, but a devotee does not have to undergo so much
trouble. By virtue of his devotional service, he attains the brahma-bhuta stage without a doubt. The yogis
and jnanis are always doubtful about their constitutional position; therefore they mistakenly think of
becoming one with the Supreme. However, a devotee's relationship with the Supreme becomes manifest
beyond all doubt, and he immediately understands that his position is that of eternal servant of the Lord.
Jnanis and yogis without devotion may think themselves liberated, but actually their intelligence is not as
pure as that of a devotee. In other words, the jnanis and yogis cannot become factually liberated unless
they become elevated to the position of devotees.
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
(Bhag. 10.2.32)
The jnani and yogis may rise to the highest position, Brahman realization, but because of their lack of
devotion unto the lotus feet of the Lord, they again fall down into material nature. Therefore jnana and
yoga should not be accepted as the real processes for liberation. By discharging devotional service,
Maharaja Prthu automatically transcended all these positions. Since Maharaja Prthu was a saktyavesa
incarnation of the Supreme Lord, he did not have to act in any way to attain liberation. He came from the
Vaikuntha world, or spiritual sky, in order to execute the will of the Supreme Lord on earth.
Consequently he was to return home, back to Godhead, without having to execute jnana, yoga or karma.
Although Prthu Maharaja was eternally a pure devotee of the Lord, he nonetheless adopted the process of
devotional service in order to teach the people in general the proper process for executing the duties of
life and ultimately returning home, back to Godhead.
