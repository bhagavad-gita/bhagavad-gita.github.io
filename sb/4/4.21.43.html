<h2>Text</h2>
nispaditas ca kartsnyena
bhagavadbhir ghrnalubhih
sadhucchistam hi me sarvam
atmana saha kim dade
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nispaditah ca--also the order is properly carried out; kartsnyena--in full; bhagavadbhih--by the
representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ghrnalubhih--by the most compassionate; sadhuucchistam--
remnants of the foodstuffs of saintly persons; hi--certainly; me--mine; sarvam--everything;
atmana--heart and soul; saha--with; kim--what; dade--shall give.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear brahmana, you have carried out the order thoroughly because you are also as compassionate as
the Lord. It is my duty, therefore, to offer you something, but all I possess are but remnants of food taken
by great saintly persons. What shall I give?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word sadhucchistam is significant in this verse. Prthu Maharaja got his kingdom from great saintly
persons like Bhrgu and others just as one gets remnants of food. After the death of King Vena, the whole
world was bereft of a popular ruler. There were so many catastrophes occurring that the great saintly
persons, headed by Bhrgu, created the body of King Prthu out of the body of his dead father, King Vena.
Since King Prthu was thus offered the kingdom by the virtue of the mercy of great saintly persons, he did
not want to divide his kingdom among saints like the Kumaras. When a father is eating food, he may, out
of compassion, offer the remnants of his food to his son. Although such food may be already chewed by
the father, it cannot be offered to the father again. Prthu Maharaja's position was something like this;
whatever he possessed had already been chewed, and therefore he could not offer it to the Kumaras.
Indirectly, however, he offered everything he possessed to the Kumaras, and consequently they utilized
his possessions in whatever way they liked. The next verse clarifies this matter.
