sa esa lokan aticanda-vego
vikarsasi tvam khalu kala-yanah
bhutani bhutair anumeya-tattvo
ghanavalir vayur ivavisahyah
SYNONYMS
sah--that; esah--this; lokan--all the planetary systems; ati--very much; canda-vegah--the great force;
vikarsasi--destroys; tvam--Your Lordship; khalu--however; kala-yanah--in due course of time; bhutani--all
living entities; bhutaih--by other living entities; anumeya-tattvah--the Absolute Truth can be guessed;
ghana-avalih--the clouds; vayuh--air; iva--like; avisahyah--unbearable.
TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, Your absolute authority cannot be directly experienced, but one can guess by seeing the
activities of the world that everything is being destroyed in due course of time. The force of time is very
strong, and everything is being destroyed by something else--just as one animal is being eaten by another
animal. Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.
PURPORT
The process of destruction is going on according to the law of nature. Nothing within this material
world can be permanent, although scientists, philosophers, workers and everyone else are trying to make
things permanent. One foolish scientist recently declared that eventually life will be made permanent
through science. Some so-called scientists are also trying to manufacture living entities within the
laboratory. Thus in one way or another everyone is busy denying the existence of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and rejecting the supreme authority of the Lord. However, the Lord is so powerful that He
destroys everything in the form of death. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (10.34), mrtyuh sarva-haras
caham: "I am all-devouring death." The Lord is just like death to the atheists, for He takes away
everything they accumulate in the material world. Hiranyakasipu, the father of Prahlada, always denied
the existence of the Lord, and he tried to kill his five-year-old boy due to the boy's unflinching faith in
God. However, in due course of time the Lord appeared as Nrsimhadeva and killed Hiranyakasipu in the
presence of his son. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.13.47), this killing process is natural. Jivo jivasya
jivanam: "one animal is food for another animal." A frog is eaten by a snake, a snake is eaten by a
mongoose, and the mongoose is eaten by another animal. In this way the process of destruction goes on
by the supreme will of the Lord. Although we do not see the hand of the Supreme Lord directly, we can
feel the presence of that hand through the Lord's process of destruction. We can see the clouds scattered
by the wind, although we cannot see how this is being done because it is not possible to see the wind.
Similarly, although we do not directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can see that He
controls the process of destruction. The destructive process is going on fiercely under the control of the
Lord, but the atheists cannot see it.
