<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Before taking his seat, however, Daksa was very much offended to see Lord Siva sitting and not showing
him any respect. At that time, Daksa became greatly angry, and, his eyes glowing, he began to speak very
strongly against Lord Siva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva, being the son-in-law of Daksa, was expected to show his father-in-law respect by standing
with the others, but because Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are the principal demigods, their positions are
greater than Daksa's. Daksa, however, could not tolerate this, and he took it as an insult by his son-in-law.
Previously, also, he was not very much satisfied with Lord Siva, for Siva looked very poor and was
niggardly in dress.
