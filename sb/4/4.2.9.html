<h2>Text</h2>
sruyatam brahmarsayo me
saha-devah sahagnayah
sadhunam bruvato vrttam
najnanan na ca matsarat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sruyatam--hear; brahma-rsayah--O sages among the brahmanas; me--unto me; saha-devah--O demigods;
saha-agnayah--O fire-gods; sadhunam--of the gentle; bruvatah--speaking; vrttam--the manners; na--not;
ajnanat--from ignorance; na ca--and not; matsarat--from envy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All sages, brahmanas and fire-gods present, please hear me with attention, for I speak about the manners
of gentle persons. I do not speak out of ignorance or envy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In speaking against Lord Siva, Daksa tried to pacify the assembly by presenting in a very tactful way that
he was going to speak about the manners of gentle persons, although naturally this might affect some
unmannerly upstarts and the assembly might be unhappy because they did not want even unmannerly
persons to be offended. In other words, he was in complete knowledge that he was speaking against Lord
Siva in spite of Siva's spotless character. As far as envy is concerned, from the very beginning he was
envious of Lord Siva; therefore he could not distinguish his own particular envy. Although he spoke like a
man in ignorance, he wanted to cover his statements by saying that he was not speaking for impudent and
envious reasons.
