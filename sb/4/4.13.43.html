<h2>Text</h2>
viniscityaivam rsayo
vipannasya mahipateh
mamanthur urum tarasa
tatrasid bahuko narah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
viniscitya--deciding; evam--thus; rsayah--the great sages; vipannasya--dead; mahi-pateh--of the King;
mamanthuh--churned; urum--the thighs; tarasa--with specific power; tatra--thereupon; asit--was born;
bahukah--of the name Bahuka (dwarf); narah--a person.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After making a decision, the saintly persons and sages churned the thighs of the dead body of King Vena
with great force and according to a specific method. As a result of this churning, a dwarf-like person was
born from King Vena's body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That a person was born by the churning of the thighs of King Vena proves that the spirit soul is
individual and separate from the body. The great sages and saintly persons could beget another person
from the body of the dead King Vena, but it was not possible for them to bring King Vena back to life.
King Vena was gone, and certainly he had taken another body. The saintly persons and sages were only
concerned with the body of Vena because it was a result of the seminal succession in the family of
Maharaja Dhruva. Consequently, the ingredients by which another body could be produced were there in
the body of King Vena. By a certain process, when the thighs of the dead body were churned, another
body came out. Although dead, the body of King Vena was preserved by drugs, and mantras chanted by
King Vena's mother. In this way the ingredients for the production of another body were there. When the
body of the person named Bahuka came out of the dead body of King Vena, it was really not very
astonishing. It was simply a question of knowing how to do it. From the semen of one body, another body
is produced, and the life symptoms are visible due to the soul's taking shelter of this body. One should not
think that it was impossible for another body to come out of the dead body of Maharaja Vena. This was
performed by the skillful action of the sages.
