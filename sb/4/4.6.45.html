<h2>Translation</h2>
The brahmanas said: Dear Lord, You are sacrifice personified. You are the offering of clarified butter,
You are the fire, You are the chanting of Vedic hymns by which the sacrifice is conducted, You are the
fuel, You are the flame, You are the kusa grass, and You are the sacrificial pots. You are the priests who
perform the yajna, You are the demigods headed by Indra, and You are the sacrificial animal. Everything
that is sacrificed is You or Your energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this statement Lord Visnu's all-pervasiveness is partially explained. It is said in the Visnu purana that
as a fire situated in one place emanates its heat and illumination everywhere, so whatever we see within
the material or spiritual worlds is nothing but a manifestation of different energies emanating from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brahmanas' statement is that Lord Visnu is everything--the fire, the
offering, the clarified butter, the utensils, the place of sacrifice and the kusa. He is everything. It is
confirmed herein that the performance of sankirtana-yajna in this age is as good as all other yajnas in all
other ages. If one performs sankirtana-yajna by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare.
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, there is no need to arrange elaborate paraphernalia for
the prescribed sacrificial ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. In the chant of the holy names, Hare and
Krsna, Hare means the energy of Krsna, and Krsna is the visnu-tattva. Combined together they are
everything. In this age, persons are harassed by the influence of Kali-yuga and cannot arrange for all the
requisite paraphernalia for performing sacrifice as recommended in the Vedas. But if one simply chants
Hare Krsna, it is to be understood that he is performing all kinds of yajna because there is nothing within
our vision except Hare (the energy of Krsna) and Krsna. There is no difference between Krsna and His
energies. Thus since everything is a manifestation of His energy, it is to be understood that everything is
Krsna. One simply has to accept everything in Krsna consciousness, and he is a liberated person. One
should not misunderstand that because everything is Krsna, Krsna has no personal identity. Krsna is so
full that in spite of keeping Himself separate from everything by His energy, He is everything. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, Ninth Chapter. He is spread throughout the creation as everything, but still
He is not everything. The philosophy recommended by Lord Caitanya is that He is simultaneously one
and different.
