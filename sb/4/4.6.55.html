<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage Maitreya said: Thus Daksa, the head of all Prajapatis, having been nicely instructed by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, worshiped Lord Visnu. After worshiping Him by performing the
prescribed sacrificial ceremonies, Daksa separately worshiped Lord Brahma and Lord Siva.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Visnu should be offered everything, and His prasada should be distributed to all the demigods.
This practice is still followed in the temple of Jagannatha at Puri. There are many temples of demigods
around the main temple of Jagannatha, and the prasada which is offered first to Jagannatha is distributed
to all the demigods. The deity of Bhagalin is worshiped with the prasada of Visnu, and also, in the famous
Lord Siva temple of Bhuvanesvara, the prasada of Lord Visnu or Lord Jagannatha is offered to the deity of
Lord Siva. This is the Vaisnava principle. The Vaisnava does not deride even ordinary living entities,
including the small ant; everyone is offered proper respect according to his position. The offering,
however, is in relation to the center, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Visnu. The devotee
who is highly elevated sees the relationship to Krsna in everything; he does not see anything as being
independent of Krsna. That is his vision of oneness.
