<h2>Translation</h2>
Prthu Maharaja then offered the total designation of the living entity unto the supreme controller of
illusory energy. Being released from all the designations by which the living entity became entrapped, he
became free by knowledge and renunciation and by the spiritual force of his devotional service. In this
way, being situated in his original constitutional position of Krsna consciousness, he gave up this body as
a prabhu, or controller of the senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Vedas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the source of material energy.
Consequently He is sometimes called maya-maya, or the Supreme person, who can create His pastimes
through His potency known as the material energy. The jiva, or the individual living entity, becomes
entrapped by the material energy by the supreme will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
Bhagavad-gita (18.61) we understand:
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
Isvara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is situated within the heart of all conditioned souls, and by
His supreme will the living entity, or individual soul, gets the facility to lord it over material nature in
various types of bodies, which are known as yantra, or the moving vehicle offered by the total material
energy, maya. Although the individual living entity (jiva) and the Lord are both situated within the
material energy, the Lord is directing the movements of the jiva soul by offering him different types of
bodies through the material energy, and thus the living entity is wandering throughout the universes in
various forms of body and becomes implicated in different situations, partaking of the reactions of fruitive
activities.
When Prthu Maharaja became spiritually powerful by the enhancement of his spiritual knowledge
(jnana) and renunciation of material desires, he became a prabhu, or master of his senses (sometimes
called gosvami or svami). This means that he was no longer controlled by the influence of material
energy. When one is strong enough to give up the influence of material energy, he is called prabhu. In this
verse the word svarupa-sthah is also very significant. The real identity of the individual soul lies in
understanding or attaining the knowledge that he is eternally a servant of Krsna. This understanding is
called svarupopalabdhi. By culturing devotional service, the devotee gradually comes to understand his
actual relationship with the Supreme personality of Godhead. This understanding of one's pure spiritual
position is called svarupopalabdhi, and when one attains that stage he can understand how he is related
with the Supreme personality of Godhead as a servant or friend or as a parent or conjugal lover. This stage
of understanding is called svarupa-sthah. Prthu Maharaja realized this svarupa completely, and it will be
clear in the later verses that he personally left this world, or this body, by riding on a chariot sent from
Vaikuntha.
In this verse the word prabhu is also significant. As stated before, when one is completely self-realized
and acts according to that position, he can be called prabhu. The spiritual master is addressed as
"Prabhupada" because he is a completely self-realized soul. The word pada means "position," and
Prabhupada indicates that he is given the position of prabhu, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for
he acts on behalf of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Unless one is a prabhu, or controller of the
senses, he cannot act as spiritual master, who is authorized by the supreme prabhu, or Lord Krsna. In his
verses praising the spiritual master, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes:
saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair
uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih
"The spiritual master is honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential
servitor of the Lord." Thus Prthu Maharaja can also be called Prabhupada, or, as described herein, prabhu.
Another question may be raised in this connection. Since Prthu Maharaja was a power incarnation of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, saktyavesa-avatara, why did he have to execute the regulative principles
in order to become a prabhu? Because he appeared on this earth as an ideal king and because it is the duty
of the king to instruct the citizens in the execution of devotional service, he followed all the regulative
principles of devotional service in order to teach others. Similarly, Caitanya Mahaprabhu, although Krsna
Himself, taught us how to approach Krsna as a devotee. It is said, apani acari' bhakti sikhainu sabare. Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed others in the process of devotional service by setting the example
Himself through His own personal actions. Similarly, Prthu Maharaja, although a saktyavesa-avatara
incarnation, still behaved exactly as a devotee in order to achieve the position of prabhu. Furthermore,
svarupa-sthah means "complete liberation." As it is said (Bhag. 2.10.6), hitvanyatha-rupam svarupena
vyavasthitih: when a living entity abandons the activities of maya and attains the position from which he
can execute devotional service, his state is called svarupa-sthah, or complete liberation.
