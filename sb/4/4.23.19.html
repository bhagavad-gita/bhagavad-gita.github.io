<h2>Text</h2>
santvayan slaksnaya vaca
hrdayena viduyata
preyasyah sneha-samrambhalingam
atmani nabhyagat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
santvayan--pacifying; slaksnaya--by sweet; vaca--words; hrdayena--with a heart; viduyata--regretting
very much; preyasyah--of his beloved; sneha--from affection; samrambha--of anger; lingam--symptom;
atmani--in her heart; na--did not; abhyagat--arouse.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King, with aggrieved mind, began to speak to his wife with very pleasing words. Although he was
filled with regret and tried to pacify her, he could not see any symptom of anger caused by love within the
heart of his beloved wife.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The King very much regretted having left his Queen and having gone to the forest to execute sinful
activities. When a person regrets his sinful activities, the abandoning of Krsna consciousness and good
intelligence, his path of deliverance from the path of material clutches is opened. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (5.5.5): parabhavas tavad abodha jato yavan na jijnasata atma-tattvam. When a person loses
his Krsna consciousness and loses interest in self-realization, he must engage in sinful activities. All one's
activities in a life devoid of Krsna consciousness simply lead to defeat and misuse of one's life. Naturally
one who comes to Krsna consciousness regrets his previous sinful activities in the human form. Only by
this process can one be delivered from the clutches of nescience or ignorance in materialistic life.
