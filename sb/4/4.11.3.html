<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
na bhavan avadhid yaksan
na yaksa bhrataram tava
kala eva hi bhutanam
prabhur apyaya-bhavayoh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; bhavan--you; avadhit--killed; yaksan--the Yaksas; na--not; yaksah--the Yaksas; bhrataram--
brother; tava--your; kalah--time; eva--certainly; hi--for; bhutanam--of living entities; prabhuh--the
Supreme Lord; apyaya-bhavayoh--of annihilation and generation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Actually, you have not killed the Yaksas, nor have they killed your brother, for the ultimate cause of
generation and annihilation is the eternal time feature of the Supreme Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the master of the treasury addressed him as sinless, Dhruva Maharaja, considering himself
responsible for killing so many Yaksas, might have thought himself otherwise. Kuvera, however, assured
him that factually he had not killed any of the Yaksas; therefore, he was not at all sinful. He did his duty
as a king, as it is ordered by the laws of nature. "Nor should you think that your brother was killed by the
Yaksas," said Kuvera. "He died or was killed in due course of time by the laws of nature. Eternal time, one
of the features of the Lord, is ultimately responsible for annihilation and generation. You are not
responsible for such actions."
