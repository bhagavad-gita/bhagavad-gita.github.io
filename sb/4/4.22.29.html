<h2>Text</h2>
sva-dharma-nisthah sata-janmabhih puman
virincatam eti tatah param hi mam
avyakrtam bhagavato 'tha vaisnavam
padam yathaham vibudhah kalatyaye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sva-dharma-nisthah--one who is situated in his own dharma, or occupation; sata-janmabhih--for one
hundred births; puman--a living entity; virincatam--the post of Lord Brahma; eti--gets; tatah--thereafter;
param--above; hi--certainly; mam--attains me; avyakrtam--without deviation; bhagavatah--unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; atha--therefore; vaisnavam--a pure devotee of the Lord; padam--post;
yatha--as; aham--I; vibudhah--demigods; kala-atyaye--after the annihilation of the material world.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A person who executes his occupational duty properly for one hundred births becomes qualified to
occupy the post of Brahma, and if he becomes more qualified, he can approach Lord Siva. A person who is
directly surrendered to Lord Krsna, or Visnu, in unalloyed devotional service is immediately promoted to
the spiritual planets. Lord Siva and other demigods attain these planets after the destruction of this
material world.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse gives an idea of the highest perfection of the evolutionary process. As described by the
Vaisnava poet Jayadeva Gosvami, pralaya-payodhi jale dhrtavan asi vedam. Let us begin tracing the
evolutionary process from the point of devastation (pralaya), when the whole universe is filled with water.
At that time there are many fishes and other aquatics, and from these aquatics evolve creepers, trees, etc.
From these, insects and reptiles evolve, and from them birds, beasts and then human beings and finally
civilized human beings. Now, the civilized human being is at a junction where he can make further
evolutionary progress in spiritual life. Here it is stated (sva-dharma-nisthah) that when a living entity
comes to a civilized form of life, there must be sva-dharma, social divisions according to one's work and
qualifications. This is indicated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13):
catur-varnyam maya srstam
guna-karma-vibhagasah
"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of
human society were created by Me."
In civilized human society there must be the divisions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra, and
everyone must properly execute his occupational duty in accordance with his division. Here it is
described (svadharma-nisthah) that it does not matter whether one is a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or
sudra. If one sticks to his position and properly executes his particular duty, he is considered a civilized
human being. Otherwise he is no better than an animal. It is also mentioned herein that whoever executes
his occupational duty (sva-dharma) for one hundred births (for instance, if a brahmana continues to act
as a brahmana) becomes eligible for promotion to Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahma lives. There
is also a planet called Sivaloka, or Sadasivaloka, which is situated in a marginal position between the
spiritual and material worlds. If, after being situated in Brahmaloka, one becomes more qualified, he is
promoted to Sadasivaloka. Similarly, when one becomes even more qualified, he can attain the
Vaikunthalokas. The Vaikunthalokas are targets for everyone, even the demigods, and they can be
attained by a devotee who has no desire for material benefit. As indicated in Bhagavad-gita (8.16), one
does not escape material miseries even if he is elevated to Brahmaloka (abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar
avartino 'rjuna). Similarly, one is not very safe even if he is promoted to Sivaloka, because the planet of
Sivaloka is marginal. However, if one attains Vaikunthaloka, he attains the highest perfection of life and
the end of the evolutionary process (mam upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate). In other words, it
is confirmed herein that a person in human society who has developed consciousness must take to Krsna
consciousness in order to be promoted to Vaikunthaloka or Krsnaloka immediately after leaving the body.
Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so 'rjuna (Bg. 4.9). A devotee who is fully in Krsna
consciousness, who is not attracted by any other loka, or planet, including Brahmaloka and Sivaloka, is
immediately transferred to Krsnaloka (mam eti). That is the highest perfection of life and the perfection of
the evolutionary process.
