<h2>Text</h2>
sriyam anucaratim tad-arthinas ca
dvipada-patin vibudhams ca yat sva-purnah
na bhajati nija-bhrtya-varga-tantrah

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sriyam--the goddess of fortune; anucaratim--who follows Him; tat--of her; arthinah--those who aspire to
get the favor; ca--and; dvipada-patin--rulers of the human beings; vibudhan--demigods; ca--also; yat--
because; sva-purnah--self-sufficient; na--never; bhajati--cares for; nija--own; bhrtya-varga--on His
devotees; tantrah--dependent; katham--how; amum--Him; udvisrjet--can give up; puman--a person; krtajnah--
grateful.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, He becomes dependent on His devotees.
He does not care for the goddess of fortune, nor for the kings and demigods who are after the favors of the
goddess of fortune. Where is that person who is actually grateful and will not worship the Personality of
Godhead?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is worshiped by all materialistic men, including big kings, and demigods
in heaven. Laksmi, however, is always after the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though He does
not require her service. Brahma-samhita says that the Lord is worshiped by hundreds and thousands of
goddesses of fortune, but the Supreme Lord does not require service from any of them because if He so
desires He can produce millions of goddesses of fortune through His spiritual energy, the pleasure
potency. This very Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy, becomes dependent on the
devotees. How fortunate, then, is a devotee who is thus favored by the Personality of Godhead. What
ungrateful devotee will not worship the Lord and enter into His devotional service? Actually, a devotee
cannot forget his obligation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead even for a single moment. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that both the Supreme Lord and His devotee are rasa jna, full of
transcendental humor. The mutual attachment between the Supreme Lord and His devotee is never to be
considered material. It always exists as a transcendental fact. There are eight types of transcendental
ecstasy (known as bhava, anubhava, sthayi-bhava and so on), and these are discussed in The Nectar of
Devotion. Those who are unaware of the position of the living entity and the Supreme Person, Krsna,
think that the mutual attachment between the Lord and His devotees is a creation of the material energy.
Factually such attachment is natural both for the Supreme Lord and for the devotee, and it cannot be
accepted as material.
