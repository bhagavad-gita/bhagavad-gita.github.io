<h2>Text</h2>
evam krpanaya buddhya
socantam atad-arhanam
grahitum krta-dhir enam
bhaya-namabhyapadyata
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; krpanaya--by miserly; buddhya--intelligence; socantam--lamenting; a-tat-arhanam--on
which he should not have lamented; grahitum--in order to arrest; krta-dhih--the determined King of the
Yavanas; enam--him; bhaya-nama--whose name was fear; abhyapadyata--came there immediately.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although King Puranjana should not have lamented over the fate of his wife and children, he
nonetheless did so due to his miserly intelligence. In the meantime, Yavana-raja, whose name was fear
itself, immediately drew near to arrest him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Foolish people do not know that every individual soul is responsible for his own actions and reactions
in life. As long as a living entity in the form of a child or boy is innocent, it is the duty of the father and
mother to lead him into a proper understanding of the values of life. When a child is grown, it should be
left up to him to execute the duties of life properly. The parent, after his death, cannot help his child. A
father may leave some estate for his children's immediate help, but he should not be overly absorbed in
thoughts of how his family will survive after his death. This is the disease of the conditioned soul. Not
only does he commit sinful activities for his own sense gratification, but he accumulates great wealth to
leave behind so that his children may also gorgeously arrange for sense gratification.
In any case, everyone is afraid of death, and therefore death is called bhaya, or fear. Although King
Puranjana was engaged in thinking of his wife and children, death did not wait for him. Death does not
wait for any man; it will immediately carry out its duty. Since death must take away the living entity
without hesitation, it is the ultimate God realization of the atheists, who spoil their lives thinking of
country, society and relatives, to the neglect of God consciousness. In this verse the word atad-arhanam is
very significant, for it means that one should not be overly engaged in welfare activities for one's family
members, countrymen, society and community. None of these will help a person to advance spiritually.
Unfortunately, in present-day society so-called educated men have no idea what spiritual progress is.
Although they have the opportunity in the human form of life to make spiritual progress, they remain
misers. They use their lives improperly and simply waste them thinking about the material welfare of their
relatives, countrymen, society and so on. One's actual duty is to learn how to conquer death. Lord Krsna
states the process of conquering death in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
After giving up this body, one who is fully Krsna conscious does not accept another material body but
returns home, back to Godhead. Everyone should try to attain this perfection. Unfortunately, instead of
doing so, people are absorbed in thoughts of society, friendship, love and relatives. This Krsna
consciousness movement, however, is educating people throughout the world and informing them how to
conquer death. Harim vina na srtim taranti. One cannot conquer death without taking shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
