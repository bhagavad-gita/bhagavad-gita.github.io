TRANSLATION
The Gandharvas said: Dear Lord, all the demigods, including Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, Indra and Marici
and the great sages, are all only differentiated parts and parcels of Your body. You are the Supreme
Almighty Great; the whole creation is just like a plaything for You. We always accept You as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and we offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
PURPORT
In the Brahma-samhita it is said that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There may be many
gods, from Brahma, Lord Siva, Indra and Candra down to the rulers of the lower planetary systems, the
presidents, ministers, chairmen and kings. In fact, anyone can think that he is God. That is the false,
puffed-up conviction of material life. Actually Visnu is the Supreme Lord, but there is even one above
Visnu, for Visnu is also the plenary portion of a part of Krsna. In this verse this is referred to by the word
amsamsah, which refers to part and parcel of a part and parcel. There are similar verses in the Caitanyacaritamrta
which indicate that the Supreme Lord's parts and parcels again expand into other parts and
parcels. As described in Srimad-Bhagavatam, there are many manifestations of Visnu and many
manifestations of living entities. Visnu manifestations are called svamsa, partial manifestations, and the
living entities are called vibhinnamsa. The demigods like Brahma and Indra have been promoted to such
exalted positions by pious activities and austerities, but actually Visnu, or Krsna, is the master of
everyone. ln the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya. This means that Krsna
alone is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all others, even the visnu-tattva and certainly the living
entities, are His servitors. Baladeva is the immediate expansion of Krsna. He also engages in the service of
Krsna, and certainly the ordinary living entities are serving. Everyone is created, constitutionally, for
serving Krsna. Here the Gandharvas acknowledge that although the demigods may represent themselves
as the Supreme, actually they are not supreme. Real supremacy belongs to Krsna. Krsnas tu bhagavan
svayam is the statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam: "Krsna is the only Supreme Lord." Worship of Krsna
alone, therefore, includes worship of all the parts and parcels, just as watering the root of a tree also
waters all the branches, twigs, leaves and flowers.
