sri-bhagavan uvaca

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Personality of Godhead said; veda--know; aham--I; te--your; vyavasitam--
determination; hrdi--within the heart; rajanya-balaka--O son of the King; tat--that; prayacchami--I shall
give you; bhadram--all good fortune; te--unto you; durapam--although it is very difficult to obtain; api--in
spite of; su-vrata--one who has taken a pious vow.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead said: My dear Dhruva, son of the King, you have executed pious vows, and
I also know the desire within your heart. Although your desire is very ambitious and very difficult to
fulfill, I shall favor you with its fulfillment. All good fortune unto you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is so merciful to His devotee that He immediately said to Dhruva Maharaja, "Let there be all
good fortune for you." The fact is that Dhruva Maharaja was very much afraid in his mind, for he had
aspired after material benefit in discharging his devotional service and this was hampering him from
reaching the stage of love of God. In the Bhagavad-gita (2.44) it is said, bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam: those
who are addicted to material pleasure cannot be attracted to devotional service. It was true that at heart
Dhruva Maharaja wanted a kingdom that would be far better than Brahmaloka. This was a natural desire
for a ksatriya. He was also only five years old, and in his childish way he desired to have a kingdom far
greater than his father's, grandfather's or great-grandfather's. His father, Uttanapada, was the son of Manu,
and Manu was the son of Lord Brahma. Dhruva wanted to excel all these great family members. The Lord
knew Dhruva Maharaja's childish ambition, but how was it possible to offer Dhruva a position more
exalted than Lord Brahma's?
The Lord assured Dhruva Maharaja that Dhruva would not be bereft of the Lord's love. He encouraged
Dhruva not to be worried that he childishly had material desires and at the same time had the pure
aspiration to be a great devotee. Generally, the Lord does not award a pure devotee material opulence,
even though he may desire it. But Dhruva Maharaja's case was different. The Lord knew that he was such
a great devotee that in spite of having material opulence he would never be deviated from love of God.
This example illustrates that a highly qualified devotee can have the facility of material enjoyment and at
the same time execute love of God. This, however, was a special case for Dhruva Maharaja.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead continued: My dear Dhruva, I shall award you the glowing planet
known as the polestar, which will continue to exist even after the dissolution at the end of the
millennium. No one has ever ruled this planet, which is surrounded by all the solar systems, planets and
stars. All the luminaries in the sky circumambulate this planet, just as bulls tread around a central pole for
the purpose of crushing grains. Keeping the polestar to their right, all the stars inhabited by the great
sages like Dharma, Agni, Kasyapa and Sukra circumambulate this planet, which continues to exist even
after the dissolution of all others.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although the polestar existed before its occupation by Dhruva Maharaja, it had no predominating deity.
Dhruvaloka, our polestar, is the center for all other stars and solar systems, for all of them circle around
Dhruvaloka just as a bull crushes grains by walking around and around a central pole. Dhruva wanted the
best of all planets, and although it was a childish prayer, the Lord satisfied his demand. A small child may
demand something from his father which his father has never given to anyone else, yet out of affection the
father offers it to the child; similarly, this unique planet, Dhruvaloka, was offered to Maharaja Dhruva.
The specific significance of this planet is that until the entire universe is annihilated this planet will
remain, even during the devastation which takes place during the night of Lord Brahma. There are two
kinds of dissolutions, one during the night of Lord Brahma and one at the end of Lord Brahma's life. At
the end of Brahma's life, selected personalities go back home, back to Godhead. Dhruva Maharaja is one
of them. The Lord assured Dhruva that he would exist beyond the partial dissolution of this universe.
Thus at the end of the complete dissolution, Dhruva Maharaja would go directly to Vaikunthaloka, to a
spiritual planet in the spiritual sky. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments in this connection that
Dhruvaloka is one of the lokas like Svetadvipa, Mathura and Dvaraka. They are all eternal places in the
kingdom of Godhead, which is described in the Bhagavad-gita (tad dhama paramam) and in the Vedas
(om tad visnoh paramam padam sada pasyanti surayah). The words parastat kalpa-vasinam,
"transcendental to the planets inhabited after the dissolution," refer to the Vaikuntha planets. In other
words, Dhruva Maharaja's promotion to the Vaikunthalokas was guaranteed by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
