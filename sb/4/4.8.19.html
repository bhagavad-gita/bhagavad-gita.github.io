<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead said: My dear Dhruva, son of the King, you have executed pious vows, and
I also know the desire within your heart. Although your desire is very ambitious and very difficult to
fulfill, I shall favor you with its fulfillment. All good fortune unto you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is so merciful to His devotee that He immediately said to Dhruva Maharaja, "Let there be all
good fortune for you." The fact is that Dhruva Maharaja was very much afraid in his mind, for he had
aspired after material benefit in discharging his devotional service and this was hampering him from
reaching the stage of love of God. In the Bhagavad-gita (2.44) it is said, bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam: those
who are addicted to material pleasure cannot be attracted to devotional service. It was true that at heart
Dhruva Maharaja wanted a kingdom that would be far better than Brahmaloka. This was a natural desire
for a ksatriya. He was also only five years old, and in his childish way he desired to have a kingdom far
greater than his father's, grandfather's or great-grandfather's. His father, Uttanapada, was the son of Manu,
and Manu was the son of Lord Brahma. Dhruva wanted to excel all these great family members. The Lord
knew Dhruva Maharaja's childish ambition, but how was it possible to offer Dhruva a position more
exalted than Lord Brahma's?
The Lord assured Dhruva Maharaja that Dhruva would not be bereft of the Lord's love. He encouraged
Dhruva not to be worried that he childishly had material desires and at the same time had the pure
aspiration to be a great devotee. Generally, the Lord does not award a pure devotee material opulence,
even though he may desire it. But Dhruva Maharaja's case was different. The Lord knew that he was such
a great devotee that in spite of having material opulence he would never be deviated from love of God.
This example illustrates that a highly qualified devotee can have the facility of material enjoyment and at
the same time execute love of God. This, however, was a special case for Dhruva Maharaja.
