<h2>Translation</h2>
By the inclination to serve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, suffering humanity can
immediately cleanse the dirt which has accumulated in their minds during innumerable births. Like the
Ganges water, which emanates from the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, such a process immediately
cleanses the mind, and thus spiritual or Krsna consciousness gradually increases.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In India, one can actually see that a person who takes a bath in the Ganges waters daily is almost free
from all kinds of diseases. A very respectable brahmana in Calcutta never took a doctor's medicine. Even
though he sometimes felt sick, he would not accept medicine from the physician but would simply drink
Ganges water, and he was always cured within a very short time. The glories of Ganges water are known
to Indians and to ourselves also. The River Ganges flows by Calcutta. Sometimes within the water there
are many stools and other dirty things which are washed away from neighboring mills and factories, but
still thousands of men take baths in the Ganges water, and they are very healthy as well as spiritually
inclined. That is the effect of Ganges water. The Ganges is glorified because it emanates from the toes of
the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, if one takes to the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, or takes to
Krsna consciousness, he is immediately cleansed of the many dirty things which have accumulated in his
innumerable births. We have seen that in spite of the very black record of their past lives, persons who
take to Krsna consciousness become perfectly cleansed of all dirty things and make spiritual progress very
swiftly. Therefore Prthu Maharaja advises that without the benediction of the Supreme Lord, one cannot
make advancement--either in so-called morality, economic development or sense gratification. One
should therefore take to the service of the Lord, or Krsna consciousness, and thus very soon become a
perfect man, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (ksipram bhavati dharmatma sasvac chantim nigacchati).
Being a responsible king, Prthu Maharaja recommends that everyone take shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and thus be immediately purified. Lord Sri Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita that
simply by surrendering unto Him one is immediately relieved of all sinful reactions. As Krsna takes away
all the sinful reactions of a person immediately upon his surrender unto Him, similarly the external
manifestation of Krsna, the representative of Krsna who acts as the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, takes all the resultant actions of the sinful life of the disciple immediately after the disciple's
initiation. Thus if the disciple follows the principles instructed by the spiritual master, he remains purified
and is not contaminated by the material infection.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore stated that the spiritual master who plays the part of Krsna's
representative has to consume all the sinful reactions of his disciple. Sometimes a spiritual master takes
the risk of being overwhelmed by the sinful reactions of the disciples and undergoes a sort of tribulation
due to their acceptance. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised that one not accept many disciples.
