<h2>Text</h2>
apalitanadrta ca
bhavadbhir loka-palakaih
cori-bhute 'tha loke 'ham
yajnarthe 'grasam osadhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
apalita--without being taken care of; anadrta--being neglected; ca--also; bhavadbhih--like your good self;
loka-palakaih--by the governors or kings; cori-bhute--being beset by thieves; atha--therefore; loke--this
world; aham--I; yajna-arthe--for the purpose of performing sacrifices; agrasam--have hidden; osadhih--all
the herbs and grains.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, not only are grains and herbs being used by nondevotees, but, as far as I am concerned, I
am not being properly maintained. Indeed, I am being neglected by kings who are not punishing these
rascals who have turned into thieves by using grains for sense gratification. Consequently I have hidden
all these seeds, which were meant for the performance of sacrifice.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That which happened during the time of Prthu Maharaja and his father, King Vena, is also happening at
this present moment. A huge arrangement exists for the production of large-scale industrial and
agricultural products, but all these products are meant for sense gratification. Therefore despite such
productive capacities there is scarcity because the world's population is full of thieves. The word coribhute
indicates that the population has turned to thievery. According to Vedic understanding, men are
transformed into thieves when they plan economic development for sense gratification. It is also
explained in Bhagavad-gita that if one eats food grains without offering them to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Yajna, he is a thief and liable to be punished. According to spiritual communism, all
properties on the surface of the globe belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The population has
a right to use goods only after offering them to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the process of
accepting prasada. Unless one eats prasada, he is certainly a thief. It is the duty of governors and kings to
punish such thieves and maintain the world nicely. If this is not done, grains will no longer be produced,
and people will simply starve. Indeed, not only will people be obliged to eat less, but they will kill one
another and eat each other's flesh. They are already killing animals for flesh, so when there will no longer
be grains, vegetables and fruits, they will kill their own sons and fathers and eat their flesh for sustenance.
