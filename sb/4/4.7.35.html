<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja said: My dear Lord Naradaji, for a person whose heart is disturbed by the material
conditions of happiness and distress, whatever you have so kindly explained for attainment of peace of
mind is certainly a very good instruction. But as far as I am concerned, I am covered by ignorance, and
this kind of philosophy does not touch my heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are various classes of men. One class is called akamis, referring to those who have no material
desire. Desire must exist, either material or spiritual. Material desire arises when one wants to satisfy one's
personal senses. One who is ready to sacrifice anything to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead can
be said to have spiritual desire. Dhruva did not accept the instruction given by the great saint Narada
because he thought himself unfit for such instruction, which prohibited all material desires. It is not a
fact, however, that those who have material desires are prohibited from worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. This is the essential instruction from the life of Dhruva. He frankly admitted that
his heart was full of material desires. He was very much affected by the cruel words of his stepmother,
whereas those who are spiritually advanced do not care about anyone's condemnation or adoration.
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that persons who are actually advanced in spiritual life do not care for the
dual behavior of this material world. But Dhruva Maharaja frankly admitted that he was not beyond the
affliction of material distress and happiness. He was confident that the instruction given by Narada was
valuable, yet he could not accept it. The question raised here is whether or not a person afflicted by
material desires is fit to worship the Supreme personality of Godhead. The answer is that everyone is fit to
worship Him. Even if one has many material desires to fulfill, he should take to Krsna consciousness and
worship the Supreme Lord Krsna, who is so merciful that He fulfills everyone's desires. Through this
narration it will become very clear that no one is barred from worshiping the Supreme personality of
Godhead, even if one has many material desires.
