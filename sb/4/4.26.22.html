<h2>Text</h2>
kala-kanya jara saksal
lokas tam nabhinandati
svasaram jagrhe mrtyuh
ksayaya yavanesvarah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kala-kanya--the daughter of Time; jara--old age; saksat--directly; lokah--all living entities; tam--her; na--
never; abhinandati--welcome; svasaram--as his sister; jagrhe--accepted; mrtyuh--death; ksayaya--for
destruction; yavana-isvarah--the King of the Yavanas.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What was described as Kalakanya should be understood as old age. No one wants to accept old age, but
Yavanesvara [Yavana-raja], who is death, accepts Jara [old age] as his sister.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Encaged within the body, the living being accepts Kalakanya, old age, just before death. Yavanesvara is
the emblem of death, Yamaraja. Before going to the place of Yamaraja, the living entity accepts Jara, old
age, the sister of Yamaraja. One is subjected to the influence of Yavana-raja and his sister due to impious
activity. Those who are in Krsna consciousness and are engaged in devotional service under the
instructions of Narada Muni are not subjected to the influence of Yamaraja and his sister Jara. If one is
Krsna conscious, he conquers death. After leaving the material body, he does not accept another body that
is material but returns home, back to Godhead. This is verified by Bhagavad-gita (4.9).

<h2>Translation</h2>
The followers of Yavanesvara [Yamaraja] are called the soldiers of death, and they are known as the
various types of disturbances that pertain to the body and mind. Prajvara represents the two types of
fever: extreme heat and extreme cold--typhoid and pneumonia. The living entity lying down within the
body is disturbed by many tribulations pertaining to providence, to other living entities and to his own
body and mind. Despite all kinds of tribulations, the living entity, subjected to the necessities of the body,
mind and senses and suffering from various types of disease, is carried away by many plans due to his lust
to enjoy the world. Although transcendental to this material existence, the living entity, out of ignorance,
accepts all these material miseries under the pretext of false egoism ("I" and "mine"). In this way he lives
for a hundred years within this body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Vedas it is stated: asango'yam purusah. The living entity is actually separate from material
existence, for the soul is not material. In Bhagavad-gita it is also said that the living entity is the superior
energy, and the material elements--earth, water, fire, air and so on--are the inferior energy. The material
elements are also described as bhinna, or separated energy. When the internal or superior energy comes in
contact with the external energy, it is subjected to so many tribulations. In Bhagavad-gita (2.14) the Lord
also says, matra-sparsas tu kaunteya sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah: because of the material body, the living
entity is subjected to many tribulations brought about by air, water, fire, extreme heat, extreme cold,
sunshine, excessive eating, unhealthy food, maladjustments of the three elements of the body (kapha,
pitta and vayu), and so on. The intestines, the throat, the brain and the other parts of the body are affected
by all kinds of diseases that are so powerful that they become sources of extreme suffering for the living
entity. The living entity, however, is different from all these material elements. The two types of fever
described in this verse can be explained in contemporary language as pneumonia and typhoid. When
there is an extreme fever in the body, there is typhoid and pneumonia, and they are described as Prajvara.
There are also other miseries created by other living entities. The state exacts taxes, and there are also
many thieves, rogues and cheaters. Miseries brought about by other living entities are called adhibhautika.
There are also miseries in the form of famine, pestilence, scarcity, war, earthquakes and so on. These are
caused by the demigods or other sources beyond our control. Actually there are many enemies of the
living entities, and these are all described to point out how miserable this material existence is.
Knowing the basic misery of material existence, one should be induced to get out of the material
clutches and return home, back to Godhead. Actually the living entity is not at all happy in this material
body. Because of the body, he suffers thirst and hunger and is influenced by the mind, by words, by anger,
by the belly, by the genitals, by the rectum, and so on. Manifold miseries encircle the transcendental
living entity simply because he desires to satisfy his senses in this material world. If he simply withdraws
from activities of sense gratification and applies his senses in the service of the Lord, all the problems of
material existence will immediately diminish, and with the advancement of Krsna consciousness, he will
be freed from all tribulation and, after giving up the body, will return home, back to Godhead.

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; atmanam--the Supreme Soul; avijnaya--forgetting; bhagavantam--the Supreme Personality
of Godhead; param--supreme; gurum--the instructor; purusah--the living entity; tu--then; visajjeta--gives

yatha--according to; karma--work; abhijayate--takes birth.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity by nature has minute independence to choose his own good or bad fortune, but when
he forgets his supreme master, the Personality of Godhead, he gives himself up unto the modes of
material nature. Being influenced by the modes of material nature, he identifies himself with the body
and, for the interest of the body, becomes attached to various activities. Sometimes he is under the
influence of the mode of ignorance, sometimes the mode of passion and sometimes the mode of goodness.
The living entity thus gets different types of bodies under the modes of material nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These different types of bodies are explained in Bhagavad-gita (13.22):
purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhunkte prakrti-jan gunan
karanam guna-sango 'sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
"The living entity in material nature follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is
due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various species.
Because of associating with the modes of nature, the living entity gets a variety of bodies from the
8,400,000 forms. It is clearly explained herein that the living entity has a little independence, indicated by
the word sva-drk, meaning "one who can see his own welfare." The living entity's constitutional position
is very minute, and he can be misled in his choice. He may choose to imitate the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. A servant may desire to start his own business and imitate his master, and when he chooses to
do so, he may leave the protection of his master. Sometimes he is a failure, and sometimes he is
successful. Similarly, the living entity, part and parcel of Krsna, starts his own business to compete with
the Lord. There are many competitors out to attain the Lord's position, but to become like the Lord is not
at all possible. Thus there is a great struggle for existence with the material world as different parties try to
imitate the Lord. Material bondage is caused by deviation from the service of the Lord and attempts to
imitate Him. The Lord is imitated by Mayavadi philosophers who try to become one with the Lord in an
artificial way. When the Mayavadi philosophers think of themselves as liberated, they are under the
delusion of mental concoction. No one can become one with or equal to God. To imagine this is to
continue one's bondage in material existence.
