<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, O Supreme Lord, You are the supreme personified form of all benediction. Therefore, for one
who abides in Your devotional service with no other desire, worshiping Your lotus feet is better than
becoming king and lording it over a kingdom. That is the benediction of worshiping Your lotus feet. To
ignorant devotees like me, You are the causelessly merciful maintainer, just like a cow, who takes care of
the newly born calf by supplying milk and giving it protection from attack.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja was cognizant of the defective nature of his own devotional service. Pure devotional
service is without material form and is not covered by mental speculation or fruitive activities. Pure
devotional service is therefore called ahaituki, unmotivated. Dhruva Maharaja knew that he had come to
worship the Lord in devotional service with a motive--to get the kingdom of his father. Such an
adulterated devotee can never see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He therefore felt very
grateful for the causeless mercy of the Lord. The Lord is so merciful that not only does He fulfill the
desires of a devotee who is driven by ignorance and desires for material benefit, but He also gives such a
devotee all protection, just as a cow gives milk to a newly born calf. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that the
Lord gives intelligence to the constantly engaged devotee so that he may gradually approach the Lord
without difficulty. A devotee must be very sincere in his devotional service; then, although there may be
many things wrong on the devotee's part, Krsna will guide him and gradually elevate him to the highest
position of devotional service.
The Lord is addressed herein by Dhruva Maharaja as purusartha-murti, the ultimate goal of life.
Generally purusartha is taken to mean execution of a type of religious principle or worship of God in
order to get material benediction. Prayers for material benediction are intended for satisfying the senses.
And when one is frustrated and cannot fully satisfy the senses in spite of all endeavor, he desires
liberation, or freedom from material existence. These activities are generally called purusartha. But
actually the ultimate goal is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called pancamapurusartha,
the ultimate goal of life. Lord Caitanya therefore taught us not to ask from the Supreme
Personality any benediction such as material wealth, popularity or a good wife. One should simply pray to
the Lord to be constantly engaged in His transcendental loving service. Dhruva Maharaja, being cognizant
of his desire for material benefit, wanted protection from the Lord so that he might not be misled or
deviated from the path of devotional service by material desires.
