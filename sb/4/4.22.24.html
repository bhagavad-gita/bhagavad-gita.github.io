<h2>Translation</h2>
A candidate for spiritual advancement must be nonviolent, must follow in the footsteps of great acaryas,
must always remember the nectar of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, must follow the
regulative principles without material desire and, while following the regulative principles, should not
blaspheme others. A devotee should lead a very simple life and not be disturbed by the duality of
opposing elements. He should learn to tolerate them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees are actually saintly persons, or sadhus. The first qualification of a sadhu, or devotee, is
ahimsa, or nonviolence. Persons interested in the path of devotional service, or in going back home, back
to Godhead, must first practice ahimsa, or nonviolence. A sadhu is described as titiksavah karunikah
(Bhag. 3.25.21). A devotee should be tolerant and should be very much compassionate toward others. For
example, if he suffers personal injury, he should tolerate it, but if someone else suffers injury, the devotee
need not tolerate it. The whole world is full of violence, and a devotee's first business is to stop this
violence, including the unnecessary slaughter of animals. A devotee is the friend not only of human
society but of all living entities, for he sees all living entities as sons of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. He does not claim himself to be the only son of God and allow all others to be killed, thinking
that they have no soul. This kind of philosophy is never advocated by a pure devotee of the Lord. Suhrdah
sarva-dehinam: a true devotee is the friend of all living entities. Krsna claims in Bhagavad-gita to be the
father of all species of living entities; consequently the devotee of Krsna is always a friend of all. This is
called ahimsa. Such nonviolence can be practiced only when we follow in the footsteps of great acaryas.
Therefore, according to our Vaisnava philosophy, we have to follow the great acaryas of the four
sampradayas, or disciplic successions.
Trying to advance in spiritual life outside the disciplic succession is simply ludicrous. It is said,
therefore, acaryavan puruso veda: one who follows the disciplic succession of acaryas knows things as
they are (Chandogya Upanisad 6.14.2). Tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: in order to understand
the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master (Mundaka Upanisad 1.2.12).
The word smrtya is very important in spiritual life. Smrtya means remembering Krsna always. Life should
be molded in such a way that one cannot remain alone without thinking of Krsna. We should live in
Krsna so that while eating, sleeping, walking and working we remain only in Krsna. Our Krsna
consciousness society recommends that we arrange our living so that we can remember Krsna. In our
ISKCON society the devotees, while engaged in making Spiritual Sky incense, are also hearing about the
glories of Krsna or His devotees. The sastra recommends, smartavyah satatam visnuh: Lord Visnu should
be remembered always, constantly. Vismartavyo na jatucit: Visnu should never be forgotten. That is the
spiritual way of life. Smrtya. This remembrance of the Lord can be continued if we hear about Him
constantly. It is therefore recommended in this verse: mukundacaritagrya-sidhuna. Sidhu means "nectar."
To hear about Krsna from Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita or similar authentic literature is to live in
Krsna consciousness. Such concentration in Krsna consciousness can be achieved by persons who are
strictly following the rules and regulative principles. We have recommended in our Krsna consciousness
movement that a devotee chant sixteen rounds on beads daily and follow the regulative principles. That
will help the devotee be fixed in his spiritual advancement in life.
It is also stated in this verse that one can advance by controlling the senses (yamaih). By controlling the
senses, one can become a svami or gosvami. One who is therefore enjoying this supertitle, svami or
gosvami, must be very strict in controlling his senses. Indeed, he must be master of his senses. This is
possible when one does not desire any material sense gratification. If, by chance, the senses want to work
independently, he must control them. If we simply practice avoiding material sense gratification,
controlling the senses is automatically achieved.
Another important point mentioned in this connection is anindaya--we should not criticize others'
methods of religion. There are different types of religious systems operating under different qualities of
material nature. Those operating in the modes of ignorance and passion cannot be as perfect as that
system in the mode of goodness. In Bhagavad-gita everything has been divided into three qualitative
divisions; therefore religious systems are similarly categorized. When people are mostly under the modes
of passion and ignorance, their system of religion will be of the same quality. A devotee, instead of
criticizing such systems, will encourage the followers to stick to their principles so that gradually they can
come to the platform of religion in goodness. Simply by criticizing them, a devotee's mind will be agitated.
Thus a devotee should tolerate and learn to stop agitation.
Another feature of the devotee is nirihaya, simple living. Niriha means "gentle," "meek" or "simple." A
devotee should not live very gorgeously and imitate a materialistic person. Plain living and high thinking
are recommended for a devotee. He should accept only so much as he needs to keep the material body fit
for the execution of devotional service. He should not eat or sleep more than is required. Simply eating for
living, and not living for eating, and sleeping only six to seven hours a day are principles to be followed
by devotees. As long as the body is there it is subjected to the influence of climatic changes, disease and
natural disturbances, the threefold miseries of material existence. We cannot avoid them. Sometimes we
receive letters from neophyte devotees questioning why they have fallen sick, although pursuing Krsna
consciousness. They should learn from this verse that they have to become tolerant (dvandva-titiksaya).
This is the world of duality. One should not think that because he has fallen sick he has fallen from Krsna
consciousness. Krsna consciousness can continue without impediment from any material opposition.
Lord Sri Krsna therefore advises in Bhagavad-gita (2.14), tams titiksasva bharata: "My dear Arjuna, please
try to tolerate all these disturbances. Be fixed in your Krsna conscious activities."
