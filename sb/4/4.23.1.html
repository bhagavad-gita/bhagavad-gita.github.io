<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued speaking to Vidura: My dear Vidura, in this way Lord Siva instructed
the sons of King Barhisat. The sons of the King also worshiped Lord Siva with great devotion and respect.
Finally, Lord Siva became invisible to the princes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This chapter contains a great lesson concerning the monarchical kingdom in the days of yore. When
King Barhisat was considering retiring from the royal duties, he sent his sons to perform austerities in
order to become perfect kings for the welfare of the citizens. At the same time, King Barhisat was being
instructed by the great sage Narada about the material world and the living entity who wants to enjoy it. It
is therefore very clear how the kings and princes were trained to take charge of a kingdom. Welfare
activities for the benefit of the citizens were aimed at understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The human form of life is especially meant for understanding God, our relationship with Him and our
activities in His service. Because the kings took charge of the spiritual education of the citizens, both the
king and the citizens were happy in Krsna consciousness. In this regard, we should remember that the
monarchical hierarchy of Pracinabarhisat comes from Maharaja Dhruva, a great devotee of the Lord and
the most celebrated disciple of Narada Muni. King Pracinabarhisat was then too much engaged in fruitive
activities due to performing different types of yajnas. One can actually be promoted to higher planetary
systems or to the heavenly kingdoms by performing various yajnas, but there is no question of liberation
or going back home, back to Godhead. When the great sage Narada saw that a descendant of Maharaja
Dhruva was being misled by fruitive activities, Narada took compassion upon him and personally came to
instruct him about the ultimate benediction of life, bhakti-yoga. How Narada Muni indirectly introduced
the bhakti-yoga system to King Pracinabarhisat is very interestingly described in this Twenty-fifth
Chapter.
