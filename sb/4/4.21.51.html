<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Prthu completely dedicated himself to be an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, transcendental to material nature. Consequently all the fruits of his activities were dedicated to
the Lord, and he always thought of himself as the servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
the proprietor of everything.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The life and dedication of Maharaja Prthu in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead serve as a good example of karma-yoga. The term karma-yoga is often used in
Bhagavad-gita-, and herein Maharaja Prthu is giving a practical example of what karma-yoga actually is.
The first requirement for the proper execution of karma-yoga is given herein. phalam brahmani sannyasya
(or vinyasya): one must give the fruits of his activities to the Supreme Brahman, Parabrahman, Krsna. By
doing so, one actually situates himself in the renounced order of life, sannyasa. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(18.2), giving up the fruits of one's activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called sannyasa.
kamyanam karmanam nyasam
sannyasam kavayo viduh
sarva-karma-phala-tyagam
prahus tyagam vicaksanah
"To give up the results of all activities is called renunciation [tyaga] by the wise. And that state is called
the renounced order of life [sannyasa] by great learned men." Although he was living as a householder,
Prthu Maharaja was actually in the renounced order of life, sannyasa. This will be clearer in the following
verses.
The word nirvisangah ("uncontaminated") is very significant because Maharaja Prthu was not attached
to the results of his activities. In this material world a person is always thinking of the proprietorship of
everything he accumulates or works for. When the fruits of one's activities are rendered to the service of
the Lord, one is actually practicing karma-yoga. Anyone can practice karma-yoga, but it is especially easy
for the householder, who can install the Deity of the Lord in the home and worship Him according to the
methods of bhakti-yoga. This method includes nine items: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving,
worshiping the Deity, praying, carrying out orders, serving Krsna as friend and sacrificing everything for
Him.
sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
(Bhag. 7.5.23)
These methods of karma-yoga and bhakti-yoga are being broadcast all over the world by the
International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Anyone can learn these methods simply by following the
examples of the members of the Society.
In one's home or in a temple, the Deity is considered the proprietor of everything, and everyone is
considered the Deity's eternal servant. The Lord is transcendental, for He is not part of this material
creation. The words prakrteh param are used in this verse because everything within this material world is
created by the external, material energy of the Lord, but the Lord Himself is not a creation of this material
energy. The Lord is the supreme superintendent of all material creations, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(9.10):
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, producing all the moving and
unmoving beings, and by its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again."
All material changes and material progress taking place by the wonderful interaction of matter are under
the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Events in the material world are not
taking place blindly. If one always remains a servant of Krsna and engages everything in His service, one
is accepted as jivan-mukta, a liberated soul, even during his lifetime within the material world. Generally
liberation takes place after one gives up this body, but one who lives according to the example of Prthu
Maharaja is liberated even in this lifetime. In Krsna consciousness the results of one's activities depend on
the will of the Supreme Person. Indeed, in all cases the result is not dependent on one's own personal
dexterity but is completely dependent on the will of the Supreme. This is the real significance of phalam
brahmani sannyasya. A soul dedicated to the service of the Lord should never think of himself as the
personal proprietor or the superintendent. A dedicated devotee should prosecute his work according to
the rules and regulations described in devotional service. The results of his activities are completely
dependent on the supreme will of the Lord.
