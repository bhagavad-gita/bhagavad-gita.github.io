<h2>Translation</h2>
King Prthu continued: By the grace of the Supreme Lord I have been appointed the king of this planet,
and I carry the scepter to rule the citizens, protect them from all danger and give them employment
according to their respective positions in the social order established by Vedic injunction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A king is supposed to be appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to look after the interests of
his particular planet. On every planet there is a predominating person, just as we now see that in every
country there is a president. If one is president or king, it should be understood that this opportunity has
been given to him by the Supreme Lord. According to the Vedic system, the king is considered a
representative of Godhead and is offered respects by the citizens as God in the human form of life.
Actually, according to Vedic information, the Supreme Lord maintains all living entities, and especially
human beings, to elevate them to the highest perfection. After many, many births in lower species, when a
living entity evolves to the human form of life and in particular to the civilized human form of life, his
society must be divided into four gradations, as ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam, etc.). The four social orders--the brahmanas, ksatriyas,
vaisyas and sudras--are natural divisions of human society, and as declared by Prthu Maharaja, every man
in his respective social order must have proper employment for his livelihood. It is the duty of the king or
the government to insure that the people observe the social order and that they are also employed in their
respective occupational duties. In modern times, since the protection of the government or the king has
been withdrawn, social order has practically collapsed. No one knows who is a brahmana, who is a
ksatriya, who is a vaisya or who is a sudra, and people claim to belong to a particular social order by
birthright only. It is the duty of the government to reestablish social order in terms of occupational duties
and the modes of material nature, for that will make the entire world population actually civilized. If it
does not observe the institutional functions of the four social orders, human society is no better than
animal society in which there is never tranquillity, peace and prosperity but only chaos and confusion.
Maharaja Prthu, as an ideal king, strictly observed the maintenance of the Vedic social order.
Prajayate iti praja. The word praja refers to one who takes birth. Therefore Prthu Maharaja guaranteed
protection for prajanam--all living entities who took birth in his kingdom. Praja refers not only to human
beings but also to animals, trees and every other living entity. It is the duty of the king to give all living
entities protection and food. The fools and rascals of modern society have no knowledge of the extent of
the responsibility of the government. Animals are also citizens of the land in which they happen to be
born, and they also have the right to continue their existence at the cost of the Supreme Lord. The
disturbance of the animal population by wholesale slaughter produces a catastrophic future reaction for
the butcher, his land and his government.
