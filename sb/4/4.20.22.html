TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead stood with His lotus feet almost touching the ground while He
rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garuda, the enemy of the snakes. Maharaja Prthu,
wiping the tears from his eyes, tried to look upon the Lord, but it appeared that the King was not fully
satisfied by looking at Him. Thus the King offered the following prayers.
PURPORT
The significant point in this verse is that the Lord was standing above the ground, almost touching it.
The residents of the upper planetary systems, beginning from Brahmaloka (the planet where Lord Brahma
lives) down to Svargaloka (the heavenly planet of Indra), are so advanced in spiritual life that when they
come to visit this or similar other lower planetary systems, they keep their weightlessness. This means
that they can stand without touching the ground. Lord Visnu is the Supreme personality of Godhead, but
because He lives in one of the planetary systems within this universe, He sometimes plays as if one of the
demigods of this universe. When He first appeared before Prthu Maharaja, He was not touching the
ground of this earth, but when He was fully satisfied with the behavior and character of Maharaja Prthu,
He immediately acted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana from Vaikuntha. Out of affection
for Prthu Maharaja, He touched the earth, but He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of
Garuda, His carrier, as if to prevent Himself from falling down, since the Lord is not accustomed to stand
on earthly ground. These are all symptoms of His great affection for Prthu Maharaja. perceiving his
fortunate position, Prthu Maharaja could not fully look upon the Lord due to ecstasy, but still, in a
faltering voice, he began to offer prayers.
