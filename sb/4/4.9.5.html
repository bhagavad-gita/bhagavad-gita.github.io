<h2>Translation</h2>
At that time Dhruva Maharaja became perfectly aware of the Vedic conclusion and understood the
Absolute Truth and His relationship with all living entities. In accordance with the line of devotional
service to the Supreme Lord, whose fame is widespread, Dhruva, who in the future would receive a planet
which would never be annihilated, even during the time of dissolution, offered his deliberate and
conclusive prayers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many important items to be considered in this verse. First of all, the relationship between the
Absolute Truth and the relative material and spiritual energies is here understood by a student who has
complete knowledge of the Vedic literature. Dhruva Maharaja never went to any school or academic
teacher to learn the Vedic conclusion, but because of his devotional service to the Lord, as soon as the
Lord appeared and touched his forehead with His conchshell, automatically the entire Vedic conclusion
was revealed to him. That is the process of understanding Vedic literature. One cannot understand it
simply by academic learning. The Vedas indicate that only to one who has unflinching faith in the
Supreme Lord as well as in the spiritual master is the Vedic conclusion revealed.
The example of Dhruva Maharaja is that he engaged himself in devotional service to the Lord according
to the order of his spiritual master, Narada Muni. As a result of his rendering such devotional service with
great determination and austerity, the Personality of Godhead personally manifested Himself before him.
Dhruva was only a child. He wanted to offer nice prayers to the Lord, but because he lacked sufficient
knowledge, he hesitated; but by the mercy of the Lord, as soon as the Lord's conchshell touched his
forehead, he became completely aware of the Vedic conclusion. That conclusion is based on proper
understanding of the difference between jiva and Paramatma, the individual soul and the Supersoul. The
individual soul is forever a servant of the Supersoul, and therefore his relationship with the Supersoul is
to offer service. That is called bhakti-yoga, or bhakti-bhava. Dhruva Maharaja offered his prayers to the
Lord not in the way of the impersonalist philosophers, but as a devotee. Therefore, it is clearly said here,
bhakti-bhava. The only prayers worth offering are those offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
whose reputation is spread far and wide. Dhruva Maharaja wanted to have the kingdom of his father, but
his father refused even to allow him to get on his lap. In order to fulfill his desire, the Lord had already
created a planet known as the polestar, Dhruvaloka, which was never to be annihilated even at the time of
the dissolution of the universe. Dhruva Maharaja attained this perfection not by acting hastily, but by
patiently executing the order of his spiritual master, and therefore he became so successful that he saw the
Lord face to face. Now he was further enabled, by the causeless mercy of the Lord, to offer fitting prayers
to the Lord. To glorify or offer prayers unto the Supreme, one needs the Lord's mercy. One cannot write
to glorify the Lord unless one is endowed with His causeless mercy.
