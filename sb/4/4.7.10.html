<h2>Text</h2>
tatha cikirsamanam tam
sapatnyas tanayam dhruvam
surucih srnvato rajnah
sersyam ahatigarvita
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatha--thus; cikirsamanam--the child Dhruva, who was trying to get up; tam--unto him; sa-patnyah--of
her co-wife (Suniti); tanayam--son; dhruvam--Dhruva; surucih--Queen Suruci; srnvatah--while hearing;
rajnah--of the King; sa-irsyam--with envy; aha--said; atigarvita--being too proud.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While the child, Dhruva Maharaja, was trying to get on the lap of his father, Suruci, his stepmother,
became very envious of the child, and with great pride she began to speak so as to be heard by the King
himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The King, of course, was equally affectionate toward both his sons, Uttama and Dhruva, so he had a
natural inclination to take Dhruva, as well as Uttama, on his lap. But because of his favoritism towards his
queen Suruci, he could not welcome Dhruva Maharaja, despite his feelings. King Uttanapada's feeling was
understood by Suruci, and therefore with great pride she began to speak about the King's affection for her.
This is the nature of woman. If a woman understands that her husband regards her as a favorite and is
especially affectionate to her, she takes undue advantage. These symptoms are visible even in such an
elevated society as the family of Svayambhuva Manu. Therefore it is concluded that the feminine nature of
woman is present everywhere.
