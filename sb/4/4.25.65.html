barhismann etad adhyatmam
paroksyena pradarsitam
yat paroksa-priyo devo
bhagavan visva-bhavanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
barhisman--O King Pracinabarhi; etat--this; adhyatmam--narration of self-realization; paroksyena--
indirectly; pradarsitam--instructed; yat--because; paroksa-priyah--interesting by indirect description;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Pracinabarhi, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, is celebrated to
be known indirectly. Thus I have described the story of Puranjana to you. Actually it is an instruction for
self-realization.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many similar stories in the puranas for self-realization. As stated in the Vedas: paroksa-priya
iva hi devah. There are many stories in the Puranas that are intended to interest ordinary men in
transcendental subjects, but actually these refer to real facts. They are not to be considered stories without
a transcendental purpose. Some of them refer to real historical facts. One should be interested, however,
in the real purport of the story. Indirect instruction is quickly understandable for a common man.
Factually the path of bhakti-yoga is the path of hearing directly about the pastimes of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (sravanam kirtanam visnoh), but those who are not interested in hearing directly
about the activities of the Lord, or who cannot understand them, can very effectively hear such stories and
fables as this one narrated by Narada Muni.
The following is a glossary of some of the important words in this chapter.
Adesa-kari. The actions resulting from sinful activities.
Agastya. The mind.
Amatya. The governor of the senses, the mind.
Arbuda-arbuda. Various types of sravana and kirtana of the Supreme Lord's name, quality, form
and so on.
Ari. Impediments like disease.
Bhoga. Enjoyment. Herein this word refers to real enjoyment in spiritual life.
Bhrtya. The servants of the body, namely the senses.
Dravida-raja. Devotional service or a person eligible to act in devotional service.
Dvara. The doors of the body, such as the eyes and ears.
Grha. Home. For spiritual cultivation one requires an undisturbed place or the good association
of devotees.
Idhmavaha. The devotee who approaches the spiritual master. Idhma refers to wood that is taken
to burn as fuel for a fire. A brahmacari is supposed to take this idhma to ignite the fire used in performing
sacrifices. By spiritual instruction a brahmacari is trained to ignite a fire and offer oblations in the
morning. He is supposed to go to the spiritual master to take lessons on transcendental subject matter,
and the Vedic injunction is that when approaching the spiritual master one must carry with him fuel to
perform yajnas, or sacrifices. The exact Vedic injunction is as follows:
tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet
samit-panih srotriyam brahma-nistham
"To learn transcendental subject matter, one must approach the spiritual master. In doing so, he should
carry fuel to burn in sacrifice. The symptom of such a spiritual master is that he is expert in
understanding the Vedic conclusion, and therefore he constantly engages in the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead." (Mundaka Upanisad 1.2.12) By serving such a bona fide spiritual master,
gradually a conditioned soul becomes detached from material enjoyment and invariably makes progress in
spiritual realization under the direction of the spiritual master. Those who are misled by the illusory
energy are never interested in approaching a spiritual master to make life successful.
Jaya. Intelligence.
Jirna-sarpa. The fatigued air of life.
Kalakanya. The invalidity of old age.
Kama. A high fever.
Kulacala. The place where there is no disturbance.
Kutumbini. Intelligence.
Madireksana. Madireksana refers to one whose eyes are so attractive that one who observes them
becomes maddened by her. In other words, madireksana means a very beautiful young girl. According to
Jiva Gosvami, madireksana means the personified deity of bhakti. If one is attracted by the bhakti cult, he
becomes engaged in the service of the Lord and the spiritual master, and thus his life becomes successful.
Vaidarbhi, the woman, became a follower of her husband. As she left her comfortable home for the service
of her husband, a serious student of spiritual understanding must give up everything for the service of the
spiritual master. As stated by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah: if one
wants actual success in life, he must strictly follow the instructions of the spiritual master. By following
such instructions, one is sure to make rapid progress in spiritual life. This statement by Visvanatha
Cakravarti is in pursuance of the following injunction from the Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.23):
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the
imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed." In the Chandogya Upanisad it is said, acaryavan
puruso veda: "One who approaches a bona fide spiritual master can understand everything about spiritual
realization."
Malayadhvaja. A nice devotee who is like sandalwood.
Pancala. The five sense objects.
Paricchada. The total aggregate of the senses.
Paura-jana. The seven elements that constitute the body.
Pautra. Patience and gravity.
Prajvara. A kind of fever called visnu jvara.
Pratikriya. Counteracting agents such as mantras and medicines.
Pura-palaka. The life air.
Putra. Consciousness.
Sainika. The condition of threefold miseries.
Sapta-suta. The seven sons, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, serving the
lotus feet of the Lord, worshiping the Deity and becoming a servant of the Lord.
Sauhrdya. Endeavor.
Suta. The son of Vaidarbhi, or, in other words, one who is somewhat advanced in fruitive
activities and who comes in contact with a devotee spiritual master. Such a person becomes interested in
the subject matter of devotional service.
Vaidarbhi. The woman who was formerly a man but took birth as a woman in his next life
because of too much attachment to woman. Darbha means kusa grass. In fruitive activities, or karmakandiya
ceremonies, one requires kusa grass. Thus vaidarbhi refers to one who takes birth in a family of
karma-kandiya understanding. However, if by karma-kanda activities one by chance comes in contact
with a devotee, as Vaidarbhi did when she married Malayadhvaja, his life becomes successful. He then
pursues the devotional service of the Lord. The conditioned soul becomes liberated simply by following
the instructions of the bona fide spiritual master.
Vidarbha-rajasimha. The best of persons who are expert in fruitive activities.
Virya. One who has mercy.
Yavana. The servant of Yamaraja.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Puranjana Becomes a Woman in the Next Life."
