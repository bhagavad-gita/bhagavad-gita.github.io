<h2>Text</h2>
tatrabhisiktah prayatas
tam uposya vibhavarim
samahitah paryacarad
rsy-adesena purusam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--thereupon; abhisiktah--after taking a bath; prayatah--with great attention; tam--that; uposya--
fasting; vibhavarim--night; samahitah--perfect attention; paryacarat--worshiped; rsi--by the great sage
Narada; adesena--as advised; purusam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Elsewhere, Dhruva Maharaja, having arrived at Madhuvana, took his bath in the River Yamuna and
observed fasting in the night with great care and attention. After that, as advised by the great sage Narada,
he engaged himself in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The significance of this particular verse is that Dhruva Maharaja acted exactly according to the advice of
his spiritual master, the great sage Narada. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti also advises that if we want to be
successful in our attempt to go back to Godhead, we must very seriously act according to the instruction
of the spiritual master. That is the way of perfection. There need be no anxiety over attaining perfection
because if one follows the instruction given by the spiritual master he is sure to attain perfection. Our
only concern should be how to execute the order of the spiritual master. A spiritual master is expert in
giving special instructions to each of his disciples, and if the disciple executes the order of the spiritual
master, that is the way of his perfection.
