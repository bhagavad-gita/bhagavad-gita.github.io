<h2>Translation</h2>
O my master, Lord Brahma is fully surrendered unto You. In the beginning You gave him knowledge,
and thus he could see and understand the entire universe, just as a person awakens from sleep and
visualizes his immediate duties. You are the only shelter of all persons who desire liberation, and You are
the friend of all who are distressed. How, therefore, can a learned person who has perfect knowledge ever
forget You?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be forgotten even for a moment by His surrendered
devotees. The devotee understands that the Lord's causeless mercy is beyond his estimation; he cannot
know how much he is benefited by the grace of the Lord. The more a devotee engages himself in the
devotional service of the Lord, the more encouragement is supplied by the energy of the Lord. In the
Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that to those who are constantly engaged in devotional service with love and
affection, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives intelligence from within, and thus they may make
further progress. Being so encouraged, the devotee can never forget, at any moment, the Personality of
Godhead. He always feels obliged to Him for having achieved increased power in devotional service by
His grace. Saintly persons like Sanaka, Sanatana and Lord Brahma were able to see the entire universe, by
the mercy of the Lord, through knowledge of the Lord. The example is given that a person may apparently
abstain from sleep all day, but as long as he is not spiritually enlightened he is actually sleeping. He may
sleep at night and perform his duties in the daytime, but as long as he does not come to the platform of
working in spiritual enlightenment he is considered to be always sleeping. A devotee, therefore, never
forgets the benefit derived from the Lord.
The Lord is addressed here as arta-bandhu, which means "friend of the distressed." As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, after many, many births of executing severe austerities in search of knowledge, one comes
to the point of real knowledge and becomes wise when one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Mayavadi philosopher, who does not surrender unto the Supreme Person, is understood to
be lacking in real knowledge. The devotee in perfect knowledge cannot forget his obligation to the Lord at
any moment.
