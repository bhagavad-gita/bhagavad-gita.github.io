<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brahmanas,
advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects
to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone
severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of
ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, samsiddhir hari-tosanam: the real perfection of life is pleasing the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: in understanding the Vedas, one has
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually understood Him surrenders
unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracetas. They underwent severe
austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They
practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One
may engage in any business--material or spiritual--but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People
training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also
to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are Aryans and actual devotees of the Lord. An Aryan is one
who does not boast, but is an actual devotee of the Lord. Aryan means "advanced." Formerly, those who
claimed to be Aryans had to be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in Bhagavad-gita (2.2) Krsna chastised
Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-Aryan.
sri-bhagavan uvaca
kutas tva kasmalam idam
visame samupasthitam
anarya-justam asvargyam
akirti-karam arjuna
"The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you?
They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher
planets, but to infamy." Arjuna, the ksatriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the
Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-Aryan family. Anyone who is
advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his
duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed.
An Aryan performs his duty. It is not that the Aryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The
Aryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracetas
underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and
penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization.
The word nirandhasam means "without food." Eating voraciously and unnecessarily is not the business
of an Aryan. Rather, the eating process should be restricted as far as possible. When Aryans eat, they eat
only prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." Thus there are
restrictions for the advanced Aryans. Although the Lord Himself can eat anything and everything, He
restricts Himself to vegetables, fruits, milk and so on. This verse thus describes the activities of those who
claim to be Aryans.
