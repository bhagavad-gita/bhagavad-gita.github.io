jnanam ajnata-tattvaya
yo dadyat sat-pathe 'mrtam
krpalor dina-nathasya
devas tasyanugrhnate
SYNONYMS
jnanam--knowledge; ajnata-tattvaya--to those who are unaware of the truth; yah--one who; dadyat--
imparts; sat-pathe--on the path of truth; amrtam--immortality; krpaloh--kind; dina-nathasya--protector of
the poor; devah--the demigods; tasya--to him; anugrhnate--give blessings.
TRANSLATION
The narration of Dhruva Maharaja is sublime knowledge for the attainment of immortality. Persons
unaware of the Absolute Truth can be led to the path of truth. Those who out of transcendental kindness
take on the responsibility of becoming master-protectors of the poor living entities automatically gain the
interest and blessings of the demigods.
PURPORT
Jnanam ajnata means knowledge which is unknown almost throughout the entire world. No one knows
actually what is the Absolute Truth. Materialists are very proud of their advancement in education, in
philosophical speculation and in scientific knowledge, but no one actually knows what the Absolute
Truth is. The great sage Maitreya, therefore, recommends that to enlighten people about the Absolute
Truth (tattva), devotees should preach the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam throughout the entire world.
Srila Vyasadeva especially compiled this great literature of scientific knowledge because people are
completely unaware of the Absolute Truth. In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, it is said
that Vyasadeva, the learned sage, compiled this great Bhagavata purana just to stop the ignorance of the
mass of people. Because people do not know the Absolute Truth, this Srimad-Bhagavatam was specifically
compiled by Vyasadeva under the instruction of Narada. Generally, even though people are interested in
understanding the truth, they take to speculation and reach at most the conception of impersonal
Brahman. But very few men actually know the Personality of Godhead.
Recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam is specifically meant to enlighten people about the Absolute Truth, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although there is no fundamental difference between impersonal
Brahman, localized Paramatma and the Supreme Person, factual immortality cannot be obtained unless
and until one attains the stage of associating with the Supreme Person. Devotional service, which leads to
the association of the Supreme Lord, is actual immortality. Pure devotees, out of compassion for the fallen
souls, are krpalu, very kind to people in general; they distribute this Bhagavata knowledge all over the
world. A kindhearted devotee is called dina-natha, protector of the poor, ignorant mass of people. Lord
Krsna is also known as dina-natha or dina-bandhu, the master or actual friend of the poor living entities,
and His pure devotee also takes the same position of dina-natha. The dina-nathas, or devotees of Lord
Krsna, who preach the path of devotional service, become the favorites of the demigods. Generally people
are interested in worshiping the demigods, especially Lord Siva, in order to obtain material benefits, but a
pure devotee, who engages in preaching the principles of devotional service, as prescribed in the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, does not need to separately worship the demigods; the demigods are automatically pleased
with him and offer all the blessings within their capacity. As by watering the root of a tree the leaves and
branches are automatically watered, so, by executing pure devotional service to the Lord, the branches,
twigs and leaves of the Lord, known as demigods, are automatically pleased with the devotee, and they
offer all benedictions.
