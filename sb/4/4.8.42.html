Yamuna; tatam--bank; suci--being purified; punyam--the holy; madhu-vanam--of the name Madhuvana;

<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear boy, I therefore wish all good fortune for you. You should go to the bank of the Yamuna, where
there is a virtuous forest named Madhuvana, and there be purified. Just by going there, one draws nearer
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always lives there.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both Narada Muni and Suniti, the mother of Dhruva Maharaja, advised Dhruva Maharaja to worship the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, Narada Muni is especially giving him directions how this worship
of the Supreme Person can very quickly fructify. He recommends that Dhruva Maharaja go to the bank of
the Yamuna, where there is a forest of the name Madhuvana, and begin his meditation and worship there.
Places of pilgrimage yield a special advantage for a devotee in quickly advancing his spiritual life. Lord
Krsna lives everywhere, but still it is very easy to approach Him in holy places of pilgrimage because these
places are inhabited by great sages. Lord Sri Krsna says that He lives wherever His devotees are chanting
the glories of His transcendental activities. There are many places of pilgrimage in India, and especially
prominent are Badari-narayana, Dvaraka, Ramesvara and Jagannatha puri. These sacred places are called
the four dhamas. Dhama refers to a place where one can immediately contact the Supreme Lord. To go to
Badari-narayana one has to pass through Hardwar on the path to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Similarly, there are other holy places of pilgrimage, such as Prayaga (Allahabad) and Mathura, and the
topmost of them all is Vrndavana. Unless one is very advanced in spiritual life, it is recommended that he
live in such holy places and execute devotional service there. But an advanced devotee like Narada Muni
who is engaged in preaching work can serve the Supreme Lord anywhere. Sometimes he even goes to the
hellish planets. Hellish conditions do not affect Narada Muni because he is engaged in greatly responsible
activities in devotional service. According to the statement of Narada Muni, Madhuvana, which is still
existing in the Vrndavana area, in the district of Mathura, is a most sacred place. Many saintly persons
still live there and engage in the devotional service of the Lord.
There are twelve forests in the area of Vrndavana, and Madhuvana is one of them. Pilgrims from all
parts of India assemble together and visit all twelve of these forests. There are five forests on the eastern
bank of the Yamuna: Bhadravana, Bilvavana, Lauhavana, Bhandiravana and Mahavana. On the western
side of the bank there are seven: Madhuvana, Talavana, Kumudavana, Bahulavana, Kamyavana,
Khadiravana and Vrndavana. ln those twelve forests there are different ghatas, or bathing places. They are
listed as follows: (1) Avimukta, (2) Adhirudha, (3) Guhya-tirtha, (4) Prayaga-tirtha, (5) Kanakhala, (6)
Tinduka-tirtha, (7) Surya-tirtha, (8) Vatasvami, (9) Dhruva-ghata (Dhruva-ghata, where there are many
nice trees of fruits and flowers, is famous because Dhruva Maharaja meditated and underwent severe
penances and austerities there in an elevated spot), (10) Rsi-tirtha, (11) Moksa-tirtha, (12) Budha-tirtha,
(13) Gokarna, (14) Krsnaganga, (15) Vaikuntha, (16) Asi-kunda, (17) Catuh-samudrika-kupa, (18)
Akrura-tirtha (when Krsna and Balarama were going to Mathura in the chariot driven by Akrura, all of
them took baths in this ghata), (19) Yajnika-vipra-sthana, (20) Kubja-kupa, (21) Ranga-sthala, (22)
Mancha-sthala, (23) Mallayuddha-sthana, and (24) Dasasvamedha.
