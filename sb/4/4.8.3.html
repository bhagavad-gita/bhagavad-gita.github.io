<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja saw his Lord just in front of him, he was greatly agitated and offered Him
obeisances and respect. He fell flat before Him like a rod and became absorbed in love of Godhead.
Dhruva Maharaja, in ecstasy, looked upon the Lord as if he were drinking the Lord with his eyes, kissing
the lotus feet of the Lord with his mouth, and embracing the Lord with his arms.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Naturally, when Dhruva Maharaja personally saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face, he
was very much agitated in awe and respect, and it appeared as if he were drinking the entire body of the
Lord with his eyes. The devotee's love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so intense that he wants
to kiss the lotus feet of the Lord constantly, and he wants to touch the tips of the toes of the Lord and
constantly embrace His lotus feet. All these features of Dhruva Maharaja's bodily expression indicate that
upon seeing the Lord face to face he developed the eight kinds of transcendental ecstasy in his body.
