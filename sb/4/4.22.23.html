<h2>Translation</h2>
One has to make progress in spiritual life by not associating with persons who are simply interested in
sense gratification and making money. Not only such persons, but one who associates with such persons
should be avoided. One should mold his life in such a way that he cannot live in peace without drinking
the nectar of the glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. One can be thus elevated by
being disgusted with the taste for sense enjoyment.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world everyone is interested in money and sense gratification. The only objective is to
earn as much money as possible and utilize it for satisfaction of the senses. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami thus
described the activities of the materialistic persons:
nidraya hriyate naktam
vyavayena ca va vayah
diva carthehaya rajan
kutumba-bharanena va
(Bhag. 2.1.3)
This is a typical example of materialistic persons. At night they waste their time by sleeping more than
six hours or by wasting time in sex indulgence. This is their occupation at night, and in the morning they
go to their office or business place just to earn money. As soon as there is some money, they become busy
in purchasing things for their children and others. Such persons are never interested in understanding the
values of life--what is God, what is the individual soul, what is its relationship with God, etc. Things are
degraded to such an extent that those who are supposed to be religious are also at the present moment
interested only in sense gratification. The number of materialistic persons in this age of Kali has increased
more than in any other age; therefore persons who are interested in going back home, back to Godhead,
should not only engage in the service of realized souls but should give up the company of materialistic
persons, whose only aim is to earn money and employ it in sense gratification. They should also not
accept the objectives of materialistic persons, namely money and sense gratification. Therefore it is stated:
bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag. 11.2.42). To advance in devotional service one should
be uninterested in the materialistic way of life. That which is the subject matter of satisfaction for the
devotees is of no interest to the nondevotees.
Simple negation, or giving up the company of materialistic persons, will not do. We must have
engagements. Sometimes it is found that a person interested in spiritual advancement gives up the
company of material society and goes to a secluded place as recommended for the yogis especially, but
that will also not help a person in spiritual advancement, for in many instances such yogis also fall down.
As far as jnanis are concerned, generally they fall down without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.
The impersonalists or the voidists can simply avoid the positive material association; they cannot remain
fixed in transcendence without being engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is
to hear about the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is recommended in this verse: vina
harer guna-piyusa-panat. One must drink the nectar of the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and this means that one must be always engaged in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord. It is the
prime method for advancing in spiritual life. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu also recommends this in the
Caitanya-caritamrta. If one wants to make advancement in spiritual life, by great fortune he may meet a
bona fide spiritual master and from him learn about Krsna. By serving both the spiritual master and Krsna
he gets the seed of devotional service (bhakti-lata-bija), and if he sows the seed within his heart and
waters it by hearing and chanting, it grows into a luxuriant bhakti-lata, or bhakti creeper. The creeper is
so strong that it penetrates the covering of the universe and reaches the spiritual world and continues to
grow on and on until it reaches and takes shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, just as an ordinary creeper also
grows on and on until it takes a solid shelter on a roof; then it very steadily grows and produces the
required fruit. The real cause of the growing of such fruit, which is here called the nectar of hearing the
glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to water the creeper of devotional service by hearing
and chanting. The purport is that one cannot live outside the society of devotees; one must live in the
association of devotees, where there is constant chanting and hearing of the glories of the Lord. The Krsna
consciousness movement is started for this purpose, so that hundreds of ISKCON centers may give people
a chance to hear and chant, to accept the spiritual master and to disassociate themselves from persons
who are materially interested, for in this way one can make solid advancement in going back home, back
to Godhead.
