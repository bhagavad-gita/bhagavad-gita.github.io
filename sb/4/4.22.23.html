<h2>Text</h2>
tatra gandharvam akarnya
divya-marga-manoharam
visismyu raja-putras te
mrdanga-panavady anu
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--there; gandharvam--musical sounds; akarnya--hearing; divya--heavenly; marga--symmetrical;
manah-haram--beautiful; visismyuh--they became amazed; raja-putrah--all the sons of King Barhisat; te--
all of them; mrdanga--drums; panava--kettledrums; adi--all together; anu--always.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sons of the King became very much amazed when they heard vibrations from various drums and
kettledrums along with other orderly musical sounds pleasing to the ear.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In addition to the various flowers and living entities about the lake, there were also many musical
vibrations. The void of the impersonalists, which has no variegatedness, is not at all pleasing compared
with such a scene. Actually one has to attain the perfection of sac-cid-ananda, eternity, bliss and
knowledge. Because the impersonalists deny these varieties of creation, they cannot actually enjoy
transcendental bliss. The place where the Pracetas arrived was the abode of Lord Siva. Impersonalists are
generally worshipers of Lord Siva, but Lord Siva is never without variety in his abode. Thus wherever one
goes, whether to the planet of Lord Siva, Lord Visnu or Lord Brahma, there is variety to be enjoyed by
persons full in knowledge and bliss.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Pracetas were fortunate to see Lord Siva, the chief of the demigods, emerging from the water with
his associates. His bodily luster was just like molten gold, his throat was bluish, and he had three eyes,
which looked very mercifully upon his devotees. He was accompanied by many musicians, who were
glorifying him. As soon as the Pracetas saw Lord Siva, they immediately offered their obeisances in great
amazement and fell down at the lotus feet of the lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word vibudhanugaih indicates that Lord Siva is always accompanied by the denizens of the higher
planets known as Gandharvas and Kinnaras. They are very expert in musical science, and Lord Siva is
worshiped by them constantly. In pictures, Lord Siva is generally painted white, but here we find that the
color of his skin is not exactly white but like molten gold, or a glowing yellowish color. Because Lord Siva
is always very, very merciful, his name is Asutosa. Amongst all the demigods, Lord Siva can be pacified
even by the lowest class of men, who need only offer him obeisances and leaves of a bael tree. Thus his
name is Asutosa, which means that he is pleased very quickly.
Generally those who are very fond of material prosperity approach Lord Siva for such benediction. The
lord, being very merciful, quickly awards all the blessings the devotee asks of him. The demons take
advantage of this leniency and sometimes take benedictions from Lord Siva which can be very dangerous
to others. For instance, Vrkasura took a benediction from Lord Siva by which he could kill everyone he
touched on the head. Although Lord Siva sometimes very liberally gives such benedictions to his
devotees, the difficulty is that the demons, being very cunning, sometimes want to experiment improperly
with such benedictions. For instance, after receiving his benediction, Vrkasura tried to touch the head of
Lord Siva. Devotees of Lord Visnu, however, have no desire for such benedictions, and Lord Visnu does
not give His devotees benedictions which would cause disturbance to the whole world.
