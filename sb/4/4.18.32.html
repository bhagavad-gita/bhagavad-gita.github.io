<h2>Translation</h2>
"Let there be only ninety-nine sacrificial performances for Maharaja Prthu," Lord Brahma concluded.
Lord Brahma then turned towards Maharaja Prthu and informed him that since he was thoroughly aware
of the path of liberation, what was the use in performing more sacrifices?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma came down to pacify King Prthu regarding his continual performance of one hundred
sacrifices. King Prthu was determined to perform one hundred sacrifices, and King Indra took this very
seriously because Indra himself was known as the performer of one hundred sacrifices. Just as it is the
nature of all living entities within this material world to become envious of their competitors, King Indra,
although King of heaven, was also envious of King Prthu and therefore wanted to stop him from
performing one hundred sacrifices. Actually there was great competition, and King Indra, to satisfy his
senses, began to invent so many irreligious systems to obstruct King Prthu. To stop these irreligious
inventions, Lord Brahma personally appeared in the sacrificial arena. As far as Maharaja Prthu was
concerned, he was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore it was not necessary
for him to perform the prescribed Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Such ceremonies are known as karma, and
there is no need for a devotee in the transcendental position to execute them. As the ideal king, however,
it was King Prthu's duty to perform sacrifices. A compromise was therefore to be worked out. By the
blessings of Lord Brahma, King Prthu would become more famous than King Indra. Thus Prthu's
determination to perform one hundred sacrifices was indirectly fulfilled by the blessings of Lord Brahma.
