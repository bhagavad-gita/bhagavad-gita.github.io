<h2>Text</h2>
yasya prasanno bhagavan
gunair maitry-adibhir harih
tasmai namanti bhutani
nimnam apa iva svayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasya--anyone with whom; prasannah--is pleased; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; gunaih--by
qualities; maitri-adibhih--by friendship, etc.; harih--Lord Hari; tasmai--unto him; namanti--offer respect;
bhutani--all living entities; nimnam--to low ground; apah--water; iva--just as; svayam--automatically.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Unto one who has transcendental qualities due to friendly behavior with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, all living entities offer honor, just as water automatically flows down by nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The question may be raised in this connection why Suruci, who was not at all favorably disposed
towards Dhruva, blessed him, "Long may you live," which means that she also desired good fortune for
him. The answer is given in this verse. Since Dhruva Maharaja was blessed by the Lord, due to his
transcendental qualities everyone was bound to offer him all respects and benediction, just as water, by its
nature, flows downward. A devotee of the Lord does not demand respect from anyone, but wherever he
goes he is honored by everyone throughout the whole world with all respect. Srinivasa Acarya said that
the six Gosvamis of Vrndavana are respected throughout the entire universe because a devotee, having
pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of all emanations, automatically pleases
everyone, and thus everyone offers him respect.
