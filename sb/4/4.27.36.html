<h2>Text</h2>
yatra narayanah saksad
bhagavan nyasinam gatih
samstuyate sat-kathasu
mukta-sangaih punah punah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatra--where; narayanah--Lord Narayana; saksat--directly; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; nyasinam--of persons in the renounced order of life; gatih--the ultimate goal; samstuyate--is
worshiped; sat-kathasu--by discussing the transcendental vibration; mukta-sangaih--by those who are
liberated from material contamination; punah punah--again and again.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Lord, Narayana, is present among devotees who are engaged in hearing and chanting the
holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Narayana is the ultimate goal of sannyasis, those
in the renounced order of life, and Narayana is worshiped through this sankirtana movement by those
who are liberated from material contamination. Indeed, they recite the holy name again and again.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Mayavadi sannyasis are missing the real presence of Narayana. This is because they falsely claim to
be Narayana Himself. According to the customary etiquette of Mayavadi sannyasis, they address one
another as Narayana. To say that everyone is a temple of Narayana is correct, but to accept another
human being as Narayana is a great offense. The conception of daridra-narayana (poor Narayana), an
attempt to identify the poor with Narayana, is also a great offense. Even to identify Narayana with
demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva is an offense.
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
"One who considers Lord Narayana on a level with great demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva is
immediately listed among nonbelievers." The fact is that by performing sankirtana-yajna one can
immediately please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then Narayana Himself descends and
immediately is present. In this age of Kali, Narayana is immediately present in the form of Lord Caitanya.
Concerning Lord Caitanya, Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32) states:
krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam
sangopangastra-parsadam
yajnaih sankirtana-prayair
yajanti hi sumedhasah
"In the age of Kali, intelligent persons perform congregational chanting to worship the incarnation of
Godhead who constantly sings the name of Krsna. Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Krsna
Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions." After all,
human life is meant for pleasing Narayana, and this can easily be done by performing sankirtana-yajna.
Whenever there is congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Gaura Narayana, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, immediately appears and is worshiped by
sankirtana-yajna.
In this verse it is said that Narayana is nyasinam gatih, the ultimate goal of the sannyasis. The goal of
those who have renounced the material world is the attainment of Narayana. A Vaisnava sannyasi
therefore dedicates his life to serving Narayana; he does not falsely claim to be Narayana. Instead of
becoming nirvaira (nonenvious of other living entities), one who tries to become Narayana becomes
envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the attempt to become Narayana constitutes the greatest offense.
Actually, when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes
nonenvious. In this material world everyone is envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the
holy name of the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering. Because of our envy of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have become envious of all other living entities. When we are no
longer envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity and fraternity in
human society. Without Narayana or sankirtana-yajna there cannot be peace in this material world.
