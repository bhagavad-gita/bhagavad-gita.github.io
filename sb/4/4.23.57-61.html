<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Queen drank liquor, King Puranjana also engaged in drinking. When the Queen dined, he
used to dine with her, and when she chewed, King Puranjana used to chew along with her. When the
Queen sang, he also sang. Similarly, when the Queen cried, he also cried, and when the Queen laughed,
he also laughed. When the Queen talked loosely, he also talked loosely, and when the Queen walked, the
King walked behind her. When the Queen would stand still, the King would also stand still, and when the
Queen would lie down in bed, he would also follow and lie down with her. When the Queen sat, he
would also sit, and when the Queen heard something, he would follow her to hear the same thing. When
the Queen saw something, the King would also look at it, and when the Queen smelled something, the
King would follow her to smell the same thing. When the Queen touched something, the King would also
touch it, and when the dear Queen was lamenting, the poor King also had to follow her in lamentation. In
the same way, when the Queen felt enjoyment, he also enjoyed, and when the Queen was satisfied, the
King also felt satisfaction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The mind is the place where the self is situated, and the mind is conducted by the intelligence. The
living entity, situated within the heart, follows the intelligence. The intelligence is herein depicted as the
Queen, and the soul, under mental control, follows the material intelligence just as the King follows his
wife. The conclusion is that material intelligence is the cause of bondage for the living entity. The point is
that one has to take to spiritual intelligence to come out of this entanglement.
In the life of Maharaja Ambarisa, we find that the great Maharaja first engaged his mind on the lotus feet
of Krsna. In this way his intelligence became purified. Maharaja Ambarisa also used his other senses in the
service of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity in the temple nicely decorated with flowers.
He engaged his sense of smell by smelling the flowers, and he engaged his legs by walking to the temple.
His hands were engaged in cleansing the temple, and his ears were engaged in hearing about Krsna. His
tongue was engaged in two ways: in speaking about Krsna and in tasting prasada offered to the Deity.
Materialistic persons, who are under the full control of material intelligence, cannot perform all these
activities. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, they become entangled by the dictations of material
intelligence. This fact is summarized in the following verse.
