<h2>Text</h2>
utsarpayams tu tam murdhni
kramenavesya nihsprhah
vayum vayau ksitau kayam
tejas tejasy ayuyujat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
utsarpayan--thus placing; tu--but; tam--the air; murdhni--on the head; kramena--gradually; avesya--
placing; nihsprhah--being freed from all material desires; vayum--the air portion of the body; vayau--in
the total air covering the universe; ksitau--in the total covering of earth; kayam--this material body; tejah--
the fire in the body; tejasi--in the total fire of the material covering; ayuyujat--mixed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way, Prthu Maharaja gradually raised his air of life up to the hole in his skull, whereupon he lost
all desire for material existence. Gradually he merged his air of life with the totality of air, his body with
the totality of earth, and the fire within his body with the totality of fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the spiritual spark, which is described as one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, is forced
into material existence, that spark is covered by gross and subtle material elements. The material body is
composed of five gross elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether--and three subtle elements--mind,
intelligence and ego. When one attains liberation, he is freed from these material coverings. Indeed,
success in yoga involves getting free from these material coverings and entering into spiritual existence.
Lord Buddha's teachings of nirvana are based on this principle. Lord Buddha instructed his followers to
give up these material coverings by means of meditation and yoga. Lord Buddha did not give any
information about the soul, but if one follows his instructions strictly, he will ultimately become free from
the material coverings and attain nirvana.
When a living entity gives up the material coverings, he remains a spirit soul. This spirit soul must enter
into the spiritual sky to merge into the Brahman effulgence. Unfortunately, unless the living entity has
information of the spiritual world and the Vaikunthas, there is a 99.9 percent chance of his falling down
again into material existence. There is, however, a small chance of being promoted to a spiritual planet
from the Brahman effulgence, or the brahmajyoti. This brahmajyoti is considered by impersonalists to be
without variety, and the Buddhists consider it to be void. In either case, whether one accepts the spiritual
sky as being without variety or void, there is none of the spiritual bliss which is enjoyed in the spiritual
planets, the Vaikunthas or Krsnaloka. In the absence of varieties of enjoyment, the spirit soul gradually
feels an attraction to enjoy a life of bliss, and not having any information of Krsnaloka or Vaikunthaloka,
he naturally falls down to material activities in order to enjoy material varieties.
