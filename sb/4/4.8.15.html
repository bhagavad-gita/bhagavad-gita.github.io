<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, by Your unbroken transcendental glance You are the supreme witness of all stages of
intellectual activities. You are eternally liberated, Your existence is situated in pure goodness, and You are
existent in the Supersoul without change. You are the original Personality of Godhead, full with six
opulences, and You are eternally the master of the three modes of material nature. Thus, You are always
different from the ordinary living entities. As Lord Visnu, You maintain all the affairs of the entire
universe, and yet You stand aloof and are the enjoyer of the results of all sacrifices.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
An atheistic argument against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead states that if God,
the Supreme Person, appears and disappears and sleeps and awakens, then what is the difference between
God and the living entity? Dhruva Maharaja is carefully distinguishing the existence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead from that of the living entities. He points out the following differences. The Lord
is eternally liberated. Whenever He appears, even within this material world, He is never entangled by the
three modes of material nature. He is known, therefore, as try-adhisa, the master of the three modes of
material nature. In Bhagavad-gita (7.14) it is said, daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: the
living entities are all entangled in the three modes of material nature. The external energy of the Lord is
very strong, but the Lord, as the master of the three modes of material nature, is ever liberated from the
action and reaction of those modes. He, therefore, is uncontaminated, as stated in the Isopanisad. The
contamination of the material world does not affect the Supreme Godhead. Krsna therefore says in the
Bhagavad-gita that those who are rascals and fools think of Him as an ordinary human being, not knowing
His param bhavam. param bhavam refers to His being always transcendentally situated. Material
contamination cannot affect Him.
Another difference between the Lord and the living entity is that a living entity is always in darkness.
Even though he may be situated in the mode of goodness, there are still so many things which are
unknown to him. But it is not the same for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He knows past, present
and future and everything that is happening in everyone's heart. Bhagavad-gita confirms this (vedaham
samatitani). The Lord is not part of the soul--He is the unchangeable Supreme Soul, and the living entities
are His parts and parcels. The living entity is forced to appear in this material world under the direction of
daiva-maya, but when the Lord appears, He comes by His own internal potency, atma-maya. Besides that,
a living entity is within the time of past, present and future. His life has a beginning, a birth, and in the
conditioned state his life ends with death. But the Lord is adi-purusa, the original person. In the Brahmasamhita
Lord Brahma offers his respect to the adi-purusa, Govinda, the original person, who has no
beginning, whereas the creation of this material world has a beginning. The Vedanta says, janmady asya
yatah; everything is born from the Supreme, but the Supreme has no birth. He has all the six opulences in
full and beyond comparison, He is the master of material nature, His intelligence is not broken under any
circumstances, and He stands aloof, although He is the maintainer of the whole creation. As stated in the
Vedas (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13), nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. The Lord is the supreme maintainer.
Living entities are meant to serve Him by offering sacrifices, for He is the rightful enjoyer of the results of
all sacrifices. Everyone, therefore, should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord with his
life, his riches, his intelligence and his words. This is the original, constitutional position of the living
entities. One should never compare the sleeping of an ordinary living entity to the sleeping of the
Supreme personality of Godhead in the Causal Ocean. There is no stage at which the living entity can
compare to the Supreme Person. The Mayavadi philosophers, being unable to adjust to all this, come to
the conclusion of impersonalism or voidism.
