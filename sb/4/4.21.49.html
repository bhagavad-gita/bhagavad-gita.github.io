<h2>Text</h2>
vainyas tu dhuryo mahatam
samsthityadhyatma-siksaya
apta-kamam ivatmanam
mena atmany avasthitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vainyah--the son of Vena Maharaja (Prthu); tu--of course; dhuryah--the chief; mahatam--of great
personalities; samsthitya--being completely fixed; adhyatma-siksaya--in the matter of self-realization;
apta--achieved; kamam--desires; iva--like; atmanam--in self-satisfaction; mene--considered; atmani--in the
self; avasthitah--situated.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Amongst great personalities, Maharaja Prthu was the chief by virtue of his fixed position in relation to
spiritual enlightenment. He remained satisfied as one who has achieved all success in spiritual
understanding.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Remaining fixed in devotional service gives one the utmost in self-satisfaction. Actually self-satisfaction
can be achieved only by pure devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to desire, He is fully satisfied with
Himself. Similarly, a devotee who has no desire other than to serve the Supreme personality of Godhead is
as self-satisfied as the Supreme Lord. Everyone is hankering after peace of mind and self-satisfaction, but
these can only be achieved by becoming a pure devotee of the Lord.
King Prthu's statements in previous verses regarding his vast knowledge and perfect devotional service
are justified here, for he is considered best amongst all mahatmas. In Bhagavad-gita (9.13) Sri Krsna
speaks of mahatmas in this way:
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible."
The mahatmas are not under the clutches of the illusory energy but are under the protection of the
spiritual energy. Because of this, the real mahatma is always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.
Prthu Maharaja exhibited all the symptoms of a mahatma; therefore he is mentioned in this verse as
dhuryo mahatam, best of the mahatmas.
