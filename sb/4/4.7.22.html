personality of Godhead, who is very kind to His devotees; mumuksubhih--also by persons desiring
liberation; mrgya--to be sought; pada-abja--lotus feet; paddhatim--system; ananya-bhave--in an
unflinching situation; nija-dharma-bhavite--being situated in one's original constitutional position;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear boy, you also should take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is very kind to
His devotees. Persons seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death always take shelter of the lotus
feet of the Lord in devotional service. Becoming purified by executing your allotted occupation, just
situate the Supreme Personality of Godhead in your heart, and without deviating for a moment, engage
always in His service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The system of bhakti-yoga described by Queen Suniti to her son is the standard way of God realization.
Everyone can continue in his constitutional occupational duties and at the same time keep the Supreme
Personality of Godhead within his heart. This was also instructed by the Lord Himself to Arjuna in
Bhagavad-gita: "Go on fighting, but keep Me within your mind." That should be the motto of every honest
person seeking perfection in Krsna consciousness. In this connection, Queen Suniti advised her son that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhrtya-vatsala, which indicates that He is very kind to
His devotees. She said, "You came to me crying, having been insulted by your stepmother, but I am
unable to do any good for you. But Krsna is so kind to His devotees that if you go to Him, then the
combined kindness of millions of mothers like me will be surpassed by His affectionate and tender
dealings. When everyone else fails to mitigate one's misery, Krsna is able to help the devotee." Queen
Suniti also stressed that the process of approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not easy, but is
sought after by great sages who are very advanced in spiritual realization. Queen Suniti also indicated by
her instruction that Dhruva Maharaja was only a small child, five years old, and it was not possible for
him to purify himself by the way of karma-kanda. But by the process of bhakti-yoga, even a child less than
five years old, or anyone of any age, can be purified. That is the special significance of bhakti-yoga.
Therefore she advised him not to accept worship of the demigods or any other process, but simply to take
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the result would be all perfection. As soon as one places the
Supreme Personality of Godhead within one's heart, everything becomes easy and successful.
