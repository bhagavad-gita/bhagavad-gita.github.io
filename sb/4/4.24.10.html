<h2>Translation</h2>
These sons and grandsons were virtually plunderers of King Puranjana's riches, including his home,
treasury, servants, secretaries and all other paraphernalia. Puranjana's attachment for these things was
very deep-rooted.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word riktha-haresu, meaning "plunderers of wealth," is very significant. One's sons,
grandsons and other descendants are ultimately plunderers of one's accumulated wealth. There are many
celebrated businessmen and industrialists who produce great wealth and are highly praised by the public,
but all their money is ultimately plundered by their sons and grandsons. In India we have actually seen
one industrialist who, like King Puranjana, was very much sexually inclined and had a half dozen wives.
Each of these wives had a separate establishment that necessitated the expenditure of several thousands of
rupees. When I was engaged in talking with him, I saw that he was very busy trying to secure money so
that all his sons and daughters would get at least five hundred thousand rupees each. Thus such
industrialists, businessmen or karmis are called mudhas in the sastras. They work very hard, accumulate
money, and are satisfied to see that this money is plundered by their sons and grandsons. Such people do
not want to return their wealth to its actual owner. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajnatapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram: the real proprietor of all wealth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
He is the actual enjoyer. So-called earners of money are those who simply know tricks by which they can
take away God's money under the guise of business and industry. After accumulating this money, they
enjoy seeing it plundered by their sons and grandsons. This is the materialistic way of life. In materialistic
life one is encaged within the body and deluded by false egoism. Thus one thinks, "I am this body," "I am
a human being," "I am an American," "I am an Indian." This bodily conception is due to false ego. Being
deluded by false ego, one identifies himself with a certain family, nation or community. In this way one's
attachment for the material world grows deeper and deeper. Thus it becomes very difficult for the living
entity to extricate himself from his entanglement. Such people are graphically described in the Sixteenth
Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (16.13-15) in this way:
idam adya maya labdham
imam prapsye manoratham
idam astidam api me
bhavisyati punar dhanam
asau maya hatah satrur
hanisye caparan api
isvaro 'ham aham bhogi
siddho 'ham balavan sukhi
adhyo 'bhijanavan asmi
ko 'nyo 'sti sadrso maya
yaksye dasyami modisya
ity ajnana-vimohitah
"The demoniac person thinks: So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my
schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I
have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I
am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none
so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall
rejoice.' In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance."
In this way people engage in various laborious activities, and their attachment for body, home, family,
nation and community becomes more and more deep-rooted.
