<h2>Text</h2>
abhyarcitas tvaya nunam
bhagavan pranatarti-ha
yad-anudhyayino dhira
mrtyum jigyuh sudurjayam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
abhyarcitah--worshiped; tvaya--by you; nunam--however; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; pranata-arti-ha--who can deliver His devotees from the greatest danger; yat--whom;
anudhyayinah--constantly meditating upon; dhirah--great saintly persons; mrtyum--death; jigyuh--
conquered; sudurjayam--which is very, very difficult to overcome.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Queen, you must have worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who delivers His devotees
from the greatest danger. Persons who constantly meditate upon Him surpass the course of birth and
death. This perfection is very difficult to achieve.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja was the lost child of Queen Suniti, but during his absence she always meditated upon
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is able to rescue His devotee from all dangers. While Dhruva
Maharaja was absent from his home, not only did he undergo severe austerities in the forest of
Madhuvana, but at home also his mother prayed to the Supreme Lord for his safety and good fortune. In
other words, the Lord was worshiped by both the mother and the son, and both were able to achieve the
supreme benediction from the Supreme Lord. The word sudurjayam, an adjective which indicates that no
one can conquer death, is very significant. When Dhruva Maharaja was away from his home, his father
thought that he was dead. Ordinarily a king's son only five years old and away from home in the forest
would certainly be supposed dead, but by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not only was
he saved, but he was blessed with the highest perfection.
