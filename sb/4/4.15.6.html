<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
vasu kala upadatte
kale cayam vimuncati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
pratapan suryavad vibhuh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vasu--riches; kale--in due course of time; upadatte--exacts; kale--in due course of time; ca--also; ayam--
this King Prthu; vimuncati--returns; samah--equal; sarvesu--to all; bhutesu--living entities; pratapan--
shining; surya-vat--like the sun-god; vibhuh--powerful.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This King Prthu will be as powerful as the sun-god, and just as the sun-god equally distributes his
sunshine to everyone, King Prthu will distribute his mercy equally. Similarly, just as the sun-god
evaporates water for eight months and, during the rainy season, returns it profusely, this King will also
exact taxes from the citizens and return these monies in times of need.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The process of tax exaction is very nicely explained in this verse. Tax exaction is not meant for the sense
gratification of the so-called administrative heads. Tax revenues should be distributed to the citizens in
times of need, during emergencies such as famine or flood. Tax revenues should never be distributed
amongst governmental servants in the form of high salaries and various other allowances. In Kali-yuga,
however, the position of the citizens is very horrible because taxes are exacted in so many forms and are
spent for the personal comforts of the administrators.
The example of the sun in this verse is very appropriate. The sun is many millions of miles away from
the earth, and although the sun does not actually touch the earth, it manages to distribute land all over
the planet by exacting water from the oceans and seas, and it also manages to make that land fertile by
distributing water during the rainy season. As an ideal king, King Prthu would execute all this business in
the village and state as expertly as the sun.
