<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Twice-born Daksa, a man like you can simply find fault in the qualities of others. Lord Siva, however,
not only finds no faults with others' qualities, but if someone has a little good quality, he magnifies it
greatly. Unfortunately, you have found fault with such a great soul.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Daksa is addressed here by his daughter Sati as dvija, twice-born. Twice-born refers to the higher
classes of men, namely the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. ln other words, a dvija is not an ordinary
man but one who has studied the Vedic literature from a spiritual master and can discriminate between
good and bad. Therefore it is supposed that he understands logic and philosophy. Sati, Daksa's daughter,
put before him sound arguments. There are some highly qualified persons who accept only the good
qualities of others. Just as a bee is always interested in the honey in the flower and does not consider the
thorns and colors, highly qualified persons, who are uncommon, accept only the good qualities of others,
not considering their bad qualities, whereas the common man can judge what are good qualities and what
are bad qualities.
Among the uncommonly good souls there are still gradations, and the best good soul is one who accepts
an insignificant asset of a person and magnifies that good quality. Lord Siva is also called Asutosa, which
refers to one who is satisfied very easily and who offers to any person the highest level of benediction. For
example, once a devotee of Lord Siva wanted the benediction that whenever he touched someone on the
head, that person's head would at once be separated from his trunk. Lord Siva agreed. Although the
benediction asked was not very commendable because the devotee wanted to kill his enemy, Lord Siva
considered the devotee's good quality in worshiping and satisfying him and granted the benediction. Thus
Lord Siva accepted his bad qualities as magnificently good qualities. But Sati accused her father, "You are
just the opposite. Although Lord Siva has so many good qualities and no bad qualities at all, you have
accepted him as bad and found fault with him. Because of your accepting his good qualities to be bad,
instead of your becoming the most exalted soul you have become the most fallen. A man becomes the
greatest soul by accepting the goodness of others' qualities, but by unnecessarily considering others' good
qualities to be bad, you have become the lowest of the fallen souls."
