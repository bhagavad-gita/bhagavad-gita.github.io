<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's face was very beautiful, and His head was decorated with a shining helmet and golden
ornaments. The helmet was dazzling and was very beautifully situated on His head. The Lord had eight
arms, which each held a particular weapon. The Lord was surrounded by demigods, great sages and other
associates. These were all engaged in His service. Garuda, the carrier of the Lord, glorified the Lord with
Vedic hymns by flapping his wings. Garuda appeared to be an inhabitant of the planet known as
Kinnaraloka.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally the Visnu form is manifested with four hands holding four objects (a conchshell, disc, club
and lotus flower). However, here Lord Visnu is described as possessing eight arms with eight kinds of
weapons. According to Viraraghava Acarya, the conchshell and lotus flower are also accepted as weapons.
Since the Lord is the supreme controller, whatever is in His hand can be considered a weapon. Four hands
hold four kinds of weapons, and the extra four hands hold an arrow, bow, trident and snake. Sri
Viraraghava Acarya describes the eight weapons as sankha, cakra, gada, padma, sarnga, sara, etc.
A king is always accompanied by his ministers, secretaries and commanders, and Lord Visnu is also
accompanied by His followers--the demigods, great sages, saintly persons and so on. He is never alone.
Consequently there is no question of the Lord's being impersonal. He is always Himself, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and His associates are also persons. From the description given in this verse,
Garuda appears to belong to the Kinnara planet. The inhabitants of the Kinnara planet have the same
features as Garuda. Their bodily features are like those of a human being, but they have wings. The word
gita-kirtih indicates that the inhabitants of Kinnaraloka are very expert in singing the glories of the Lord.
In Brahma-samhita it is said: jagad-anda-koti-kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam. In each and every
universe there are different types of planets, and each planet has distinctive features. On the strength of
this verse, we can understand that in Kinnaraloka the inhabitants can fly with their wings. There is also a
planet, known as Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants can fly even without wings. Thus each and every
planet has some distinctive facility. That is the beauty of the varied creation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
