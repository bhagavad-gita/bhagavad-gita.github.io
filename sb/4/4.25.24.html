<h2>Text</h2>
purim vihayopagata
uparuddho bhujangamah
yada tam evanu puri
visirna prakrtim gata
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
purim--the city; vihaya--having given up; upagatah--gone out; uparuddhah--arrested; bhujangamah--the
serpent; yada--when; tam--him; eva--certainly; anu--after; puri--the city; visirna--scattered; prakrtim--
matter; gata--turned into.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The serpent, who had already been arrested by the soldiers of Yavana-raja and was out of the city, began
to follow his master along with the others. As soon as they all left the city, it was immediately dismantled
and smashed to dust.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the living entity is arrested, all his followers--namely the life air, the senses and sense objects--
immediately leave the lump of matter, the body. When the living entity and his companions leave, the
body no longer works but turns into basic material elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether. When a city
attacked by enemies is vacated by its inhabitants, the enemy immediately takes advantage of that city and
bombards it to smash the whole thing to dust. When we say, "Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shall
return," we refer to the body. When a city is attacked and bombarded by enemies, the citizens generally
leave, and the city ceases to exist.
It is a foolish person who engages in improving the condition of a city without caring for the citizens or
inhabitants. Similarly, a living entity who is not properly enlightened in spiritual knowledge simply takes
care of the external body, not knowing that the spirit soul is the principal factor within the body. When
one is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the spirit soul is saved from eternal transmigration. The
Bhagavatam considers those who are attached to their bodies to be like cows and asses (sa eva go-kharah).
The cow is a very innocent animal, and the ass is a beast of burden. One who labors under the bodily
conception simply works like an ass and does not know his self-interest. It is therefore said:
yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke
sva-dhih kalatradisu bhauma ijya-dhih
yat-tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij
janesv abhijnesu sa eva go-kharah
"A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the byproducts
of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of birth worshipable, and who goes to a
place of pilgrimage simply to take a bath rather than meet men of transcendental knowledge there, is to be
considered like an ass or a cow." (Bhag. 10.84.13)
Human civilization devoid of Krsna consciousness is simply a civilization of lower animals. Sometimes
such a civilization may study the dead body and consider the brain or the heart. However, no part of the
body is important unless the spirit soul is present. In a modern civilization of cows and asses, scientists
try to search out some value in the brain or heart of a dead man.
