<h2>Synonyms</h2>
stanau--breasts; vyanjita--indicating; kaisorau--new youth; sama-vrttau--equally round; nirantarau--
fixed close, side by side; vastra-antena--by the end of the sari; niguhantim--trying to cover; vridaya--out of

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
With the end of her sari the woman was trying to cover her breasts, which were equally round and well
placed side by side. She again and again tried to cover them out of shyness while she walked exactly like a
great elephant.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The two breasts represent attachment and envy. The symptoms of raga and dvesa (attachment and envy)
are described in Bhagavad-gita (3.34):
indriyasyendriyasyarthe
raga-dvesau vyavasthitau
tayor na vasam agacchet
tau hy asya paripanthinau
"Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under
the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization."
These representatives of attachment and envy are very much unfavorable for advancement in spiritual
life. One should not be attracted by the breasts of young women. The great saint Sankaracarya has
described the breasts of women, especially young women, as nothing but a combination of muscles and
blood, so one should not be attracted by the illusory energy of raised breasts with nipples. They are agents
of maya meant to victimize the opposite sex. Because the breasts are equally attractive, they are described
as sama-vrttau. The sex impulse remains in an old man's heart also, even up to the point of death. To be
rid of such agitation, one must be very much advanced in spiritual consciousness, like Yamunacarya, who
said:
yad-avadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatam rantum asit
tad-avadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikarah susthu nisthivanam ca
"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in
Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." When one is
spiritually advanced he can no longer be attracted by the lumps of flesh and blood which are the breasts of
young women. The word nirantarau is significant because although the breasts are situated in different
locations, the action is the same. We should not make any distinction between attachment and envy. As
described in Bhagavad-gita (3.37), they are both products of rajo-guna (kama esa krodha esa rajo-gunasamudbhavah).
The word niguhantim ("trying to cover") indicates that even if one is tainted by kama, lobha, krodha,
etc., they can be transfigured by Krsna consciousness. In other words, one can utilize kama (lust) for
serving Krsna. Being impelled by lust, an ordinary worker will work hard day and night; similarly a
devotee can work hard day and night to satisfy Krsna. Just as karmis are working hard to satisfy kamakrodha,
a devotee should work in the same way to satisfy Krsna. Similarly, krodha (anger) can also be
used in the service of Krsna when it is applied to the nondevotee demons. Hanumanji applied his anger in
this way. He was a great devotee of Lord Ramacandra, and he utilized his anger to set fire to the kingdom
of Ravana, a nondevotee demon. Thus kama (lust) can be utilized to satisfy Krsna, and krodha (anger) can
be utilized to punish the demons. When both are used for Krsna's service, they lose their material
significance and become spiritually important.
