<h2>Text</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; varam--benediction; vrnidhvam--ask;
bhadram--good fortune; vah--of you; yuyam--you; me--from Me; nrpa-nandanah--O sons of the King;
sauhardena--by friendship; aprthak--nondifferent; dharmah--occupation; tustah--pleased; aham--I;
sauhrdena--by friendship; vah--of you.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: My dear sons of the King, I am very much pleased by the
friendly relationships among you. All of you are engaged in one occupation--devotional service. I am so
pleased with your mutual friendship that I wish you all good fortune. Now you may ask a benediction of
Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since the sons of King Pracinabarhisat were all united in Krsna consciousness, the Lord was very
pleased with them. Each and every one of the sons of King Pracinabarhisat was an individual soul, but
they were united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the individual souls
attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world
such unity is not possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different interests. In the
United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their particular national ambitions, and consequently
they cannot be united. Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world that even
in a society of Krsna consciousness, members sometimes appear disunited due to their having different
opinions and leaning toward material things. Actually, in Krsna consciousness there cannot be two
opinions. There is only one goal: to serve Krsna to one's best ability. If there is some disagreement over
service, such disagreement is to be taken as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This makes the Supreme
Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as
indicated in this verse. We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedictions to the
sons of King Pracinabarhisat.
