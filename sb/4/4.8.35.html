<h2>Text</h2>
svarajyam yacchato maudhyan
mano me bhiksito bata
isvarat ksina-punyena
phali-karan ivadhanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
svarajyam--His devotional service; yacchatah--from the Lord, who was willing to offer; maudhyat--by
foolishness; manah--material prosperity; me--by me; bhiksitah--was asked for; bata--alas; isvarat--from a
great emperor; ksina--reduced; punyena--whose pious activities; phali-karan--broken particles of husked
rice; iva--like; adhanah--a poor man.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of my state of complete foolishness and paucity of pious activities, although the Lord offered
me His personal service, I wanted material name, fame and prosperity. My case is just like that of the poor
man who, when he satisfied a great emperor who wanted to give him anything he might ask, out of
ignorance asked only a few broken grains of husked rice.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word svarajyam, which means "complete independence," is very significant. A
conditioned soul does not know what complete independence is. Complete independence means situation
in one's own constitutional position. The real independence of a living entity, who is part and parcel of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is to remain always dependent on the Supreme Lord, just like a
child who plays in complete independence, guided by his parents, who watch over him. The
independence of the conditioned soul does not mean to fight with the obstacles offered by maya, but to
surrender to Krsna. In the material world, everyone is trying to become completely independent simply by
fighting against the obstacles offered by maya. This is called the struggle for existence. Real independence
is to be reinstated in the service of the Lord. Anyone who goes to the Vaikuntha planets or Goloka
Vrndavana planet is freely offering his service to the Lord. That is complete independence. Just contrary
to this is material overlordship, which we wrongly take to be independence. Many great political leaders
have tried to establish independence, but due to such so-called independence the people's dependence has
only increased. The living entity cannot be happy trying to be independent in the material world. One has
to surrender, therefore, unto the lotus feet of the Lord and engage in his original, eternal service.
Dhruva Maharaja regrets that he wanted material opulence and greater prosperity than that of his greatgrandfather,
Lord Brahma. His begging from the Lord was like a poor man's asking a great emperor for a
few grains of broken rice. The conclusion is that anyone who is engaged in the loving service of the Lord
should never ask for material prosperity from the Lord. The awarding of material prosperity simply
depends on the stringent rules and regulations of the external energy. Pure devotees ask the Lord only for
the privilege of serving Him. This is our real independence. If we want anything else, it is a sign of our
misfortune.
