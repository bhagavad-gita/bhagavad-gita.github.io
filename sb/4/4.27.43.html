<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the
protector of surrendered souls, being thus addressed by the Pracetas and worshiped by them, replied,
"May whatever you have prayed for be fulfilled." After saying this, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
whose prowess is never defeated, left. The Pracetas were unwilling to be separated from Him because they
had not seen Him to their full satisfaction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word anapavarga-virya is significant in this verse. The word ana means "without," pavarga means
"the materialistic way of life," and virya means "prowess." The prowess of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead always contains six basic opulences, one of which is renunciation. Although the Pracetas desired
to see the Lord to their full satisfaction, the Lord left. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, this is an
exhibition of His kindness to innumerable other devotees. Although He was being attracted by the
Pracetas, He left. This is an example of His renunciation. This renunciation was also exhibited by Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu when He stayed with Advaita Prabhu after taking sannyasa. All the devotees there
wanted Him to stay a few days longer, but Lord Caitanya left without hesitation. The conclusion is that
although the Supreme Lord has unlimited kindness for His devotees, He is not attached to anyone. He is
equally kind to His innumerable devotees all over the creation.
