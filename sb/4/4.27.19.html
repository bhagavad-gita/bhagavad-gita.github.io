<h2>Text</h2>
grhesv avisatam capi
pumsam kusala-karmanam
mad-varta-yata-yamanam
na bandhaya grha matah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
grhesu--in family life; avisatam--who have entered; ca--also; api--even; pumsam--of persons; kusalakarmanam--
engaged in auspicious activities; mat-varta--in topics about Me; yata--is expended; yamanam--
whose every moment; na--not; bandhaya--for bondage; grhah--household life; matah--considered.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service certainly understand that the
ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus when one
acts, he offers the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and passes life always engaged in the
topics of the Lord. Even though such a person may be participating in family life, he is not affected by the
results of his actions.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally a person living in a family becomes overly attached to fruitive activity. In other words, he tries
to enjoy the results of his activities. A devotee, however, knows that Krsna is the supreme enjoyer and the
supreme proprietor (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram). Consequently, the devotee does
not consider himself the proprietor of any occupation. The devotee always thinks of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as the proprietor; therefore the results of his business are offered to the Supreme
Lord. One who thus lives in the material world with his family and children never becomes affected by the
contaminations of the material world. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9):
yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra
loko 'yam karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samacara
One who tries to enjoy the results of his activities becomes bound by the results. One who offers the
results or profits to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, does not become entangled in the
results. This is the secret of success. Generally people take sannyasa to become free from the reactions of
fruitive activity. One who does not receive the results of his actions but offers them instead to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly remains in a liberated condition. In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Sri
Rupa Gosvami confirms this:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
If one engages himself in the service of the Lord through his life, wealth, words, intelligence and
everything he possesses, he will always be liberated in any condition. Such a person is called a jivanmukta,
one who is liberated during this lifetime. Devoid of Krsna consciousness, those who engage in
material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage. They have to suffer and enjoy the
actions and reactions of all activity. This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to
humanity because it keeps one always engaged in Krsna's service. The devotees think of Krsna, act for
Krsna, eat for Krsna, sleep for Krsna and work for Krsna. Thus everything is engaged in the service of
Krsna. A total life in Krsna consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated by
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja:
krsna-bhajane yaha haya anukula
visaya baliya tyage taha haya bhula
If one is so expert that he can engage everything or dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, to give
up the material world would be a great blunder. One should learn how to dovetail everything in the
service of the Lord, for everything is connected to Krsna. That is the real purpose of life and secret of
success. As reiterated later in the Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (3.19):
tasmad asaktah satatam
karyam karma samacara
asakto hy acaran karma
param apnoti purusah
"Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty; for by
working without attachment, one attains the Supreme."
The Third Chapter of Bhagavad-gita specifically considers material activities for the purpose of sense
gratification and material activities for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that
these are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are the cause of material
bondage, whereas the very same activities for the satisfaction of Krsna are the cause of liberation. How the
same activity can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows. One may get
indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations--condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even
though there is indigestion or diarrhea, another milk preparation--yogurt mixed with black pepper and
salt--will immediately cure these maladies. In other words, one milk preparation can cause indigestion
and diarrhea, and another milk preparation can cure them.
If one is placed in material opulence due to the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
he should not consider that opulence a cause for bondage. When a mature devotee is blessed with
material opulence, he does not become affected adversely, for he knows how to employ material opulence
in the service of the Lord. There are many such examples in the history of the world. There were kings
like Prthu Maharaja, Prahlada Maharaja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and Maharaja Iksvaku. All of
these were great kings and were especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is
not mature, the Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. This principle is stated by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead--yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih: "My first mercy shown to My
devotee is to take away all his material opulence." Material opulence detrimental to devotional service is
taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is mature in devotional service is given all
material facilities.
