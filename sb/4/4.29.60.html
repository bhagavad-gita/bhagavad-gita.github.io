narada uvaca
yenaivarabhate karma
tenaivamutra tat puman
bhunkte hy avyavadhanena
lingena manasa svayam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
naradah uvaca--Narada said; yena--by which; eva--certainly; arabhate--begins; karma--fruitive activities;
tena--by that body; eva--certainly; amutra--in the next life; tat--that; puman--the living entity; bhunkte--
enjoys; hi--because; avyavadhanena--without any change; lingena--by the subtle body; manasa--by the
mind; svayam--personally.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada continued: The living entity acts in a gross body in this life. This body is forced to
act by the subtle body, composed of mind, intelligence and ego. After the gross body is lost, the subtle
body is still there to enjoy or suffer. Thus there is no change.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entity has two kinds of body--the subtle body and the gross body. Actually he enjoys through
the subtle body, which is composed of mind, intelligence and ego. The gross body is the instrumental
outer covering. When the gross body is lost, or when it dies, the root of the gross body--the mind,
intelligence and ego--continues and brings about another gross body. Although the gross bodies
apparently change, the real root of the gross body--the subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego--is
always there. The subtle body's activities--be they pious or impious--create another situation for the living
entity to enjoy or suffer in the next gross body. Thus the subtle body continues whereas the gross bodies
change one after another.
Since modern scientists and philosophers are too materialistic, and since their knowledge is taken away
by the illusory energy, they cannot explain how the gross body is changing. The materialistic philosopher
Darwin has tried to study the changes of the gross body, but because he had no knowledge of either the
subtle body or the soul, he could not clearly explain how the evolutionary process is going on. One may
change the gross body, but he works in the subtle body. People cannot understand the activities of the
subtle body, and consequently they are bewildered as to how the actions of one gross body affect another
gross body. The activities of the subtle body are also guided by the Supersoul, as explained in Bhagavadgita
(15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."
Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is always guiding the individual soul, the
individual soul always knows how to act according to the reactions of his past karma. In other words, the
Supersoul reminds him to act in such a way. Therefore although there is apparently a change in the gross
body, there is a continuation between the lives of an individual soul.
