<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Covered by the mode of ignorance in material nature, the living entity is sometimes a male, sometimes a
female, sometimes a eunuch, sometimes a human being, sometimes a demigod, sometimes a bird, an
animal, and so on. In this way he is wandering within the material world. His acceptance of different types
of bodies is brought about by his activities under the influence of the modes of nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually the living entity is part and parcel of the Lord; therefore he is spiritual in quality. The living
entity is never material, and his material conception is simply a mistake due to forgetfulness. He is as
brilliant as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Both the sun and the sunshine are very brilliant. The
Lord is like the full shining sun, and the living entities are like the small particles of that sun which
constitute the all-pervasive sunshine. When these small particles are covered by the cloud of maya, they
lose their shining capacity. When the cloud of maya is gone, the particles again become brilliant and
shining. As soon as the living entity is covered by the ignorance of maya, or darkness, he cannot
understand his relationship with the Supreme God. Somehow or other, if he comes before the Lord, he
can see himself as shining as the Supreme Lord, although he is not as extensive as the Lord. Because the
living entity desires to imitate the Supreme Lord, he is covered by maya. We cannot imitate the Lord, nor
can we become the supreme enjoyer. This is not possible, and when we think it is, we become
conditioned by maya. Thus the encagement of the living entity under the clutches of maya is brought
about by forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord.
Under the influence of maya, the living entity becomes exactly like a person haunted by a ghost. Such a
person speaks all kinds of nonsense. When the living entity is covered by the influence of maya, he
becomes a so-called scientist, philosopher, politician or socialist, and at every moment presents different
plans for the benefit of human society. All these plans are ultimately failures because they are illusory. In
this way the living entity forgets his position as an eternal servant of the Lord. He instead becomes a
servant of maya. In any case he remains a servant. It is his misfortune that by forgetting his real contact
with the Supreme Lord, he becomes a servant of maya. As servant of maya, he sometimes becomes a king,
sometimes an ordinary citizen, sometimes a brahmana, a sudra, and so on. Sometimes he is a happy man,
sometimes a prosperous man, sometimes a small insect. Sometimes he is in heaven and sometimes in hell.
Sometimes he is a demigod, and sometimes he is a demon. Sometimes he is a servant, and sometimes he is
a master. In this way the living entity wanders all over the universe. Only when he comes in contact with
the bona fide spiritual master can he understand his real constitutional position. He then becomes
disgusted with material existence. At that time, in full Krsna consciousness, he regrets his past
experiences in material existence. This regret is very beneficial because it purifies the living entity of
material, conditional life. He then prays to the Lord to engage in His service, and at that time, Krsna
grants liberation from the clutches of maya. Lord Krsna explains this in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it."
Only by the grace of Krsna can one get out of the clutches of maya. It is not possible to get out by
mental speculation or other activities. When the living entity understands his real position by the grace of
Krsna, he keeps himself always fit in Krsna consciousness and acts accordingly. Thus he gradually
becomes completely free from the clutches of maya. When he is strong in Krsna consciousness, maya
cannot touch him. In this way, in the association of Krsna conscious devotees, the living entity can get
free from the contamination of material existence. In this connection, Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami
says:
tate krsna bhaje, kare gurura sevana
maya-jala chute, paya krsnera carana
"In the Krsna conscious state, the living entity engages in devotional service under the direction of the
spiritual master. In this way he gets out of the clutches of maya and takes shelter under the lotus feet of
Lord Krsna." (Cc. Madhya 22.25)

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity is exactly like a dog, who, overcome with hunger, goes from door to door for some
food. According to his destiny, he sometimes receives punishment and is driven out and at other times
receives a little food to eat. Similarly, the living entity, being influenced by so many desires, wanders in
different species of life according to destiny. Sometimes he is high, and sometimes he is low. Sometimes
he goes to the heavenly planets, sometimes to hell, sometimes to the middle planets, and so on.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entity's position is herein likened to a dog's. By chance a dog may have a very rich owner, and
by chance he may become a street dog. As the dog of a rich man, he will live very opulently. Sometimes in
Western countries we hear of a master leaving millions of dollars to a dog in his will. Of course, there are
many dogs loitering in the street without food. Therefore, to liken the conditional existence of the living
entity to that of a dog is very appropriate. An intelligent human being, however, can understand that if he
has to live the life of a dog, he had best become Krsna's dog. In the material world a dog is sometimes
elevated and is sometimes on the street, but in the spiritual world, Krsna's dog is perpetually, eternally
happy. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung: vaisnava thakura tomara kukura baliya janaha
more. In this way Bhaktivinoda Thakura offers to become a Vaisnava's dog. A dog always keeps himself at
his master's door and does not allow any person unfavorable to the master to enter. Similarly, one should
engage in the service of a Vaisnava and try to please him in every respect. Unless one does so, he does not
make spiritual advancement. Apart from spiritual advancement, in the material world if one does not
develop his qualities in goodness, he cannot be promoted to the higher planetary system. As confirmed by
Bhagavad-gita (14.18):
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode
of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."
There are many varieties of life in the different planetary systems, and these come about due to the
living entity's developing his qualities in goodness, passion and ignorance. If one is in goodness, he is
promoted to the higher systems; if in passion, he remains in the middle systems; and if in ignorance, he is
pushed down to the lower species of life.
