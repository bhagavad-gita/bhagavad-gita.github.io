TRANSLATION
My dear King, one brahmana, who was an old friend of King Puranjana, came to that place and began to
pacify the Queen with sweet words.
PURPORT
The appearance of an old friend in the form of a brahmana is very significant. In His Paramatma feature,
Krsna is the old friend of everyone. According to Vedic injunction, Krsna is sitting with the living entity
side by side. According to the sruti-mantra (dva suparna sayuja sakhayah), the Lord is sitting within the
heart of every living entity as suhrt, the best friend. The Lord is always eager to have the living entity
come home, back to Godhead. Sitting with the living entity as witness, the Lord gives him all chances to
enjoy himself materially, but whenever there is an opportunity, the Lord gives good counsel and advises
the living entity to abandon trying to become happy through material adjustment and instead turn his
face toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. When one becomes serious to
follow the mission of the spiritual master, his resolution is tantamount to seeing the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. As explained before, this means meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the
instruction of the spiritual master. This is technically called vani-seva. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura states in his Bhagavad-gita commentary on the verse vyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kurunandana
(Bg. 2.41) that one should serve the words of the spiritual master. The disciple must stick to
whatever the spiritual master orders. Simply by following on that line, one sees the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, appeared before the Queen as a brahmana, but why
didn't He appear in His original form as Sri Krsna? Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that
unless one is very highly elevated in loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one cannot see Him as
He is. Nonetheless, if one sticks to the principles enunciated by the spiritual master, somehow or other he
is in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since the Lord is in the heart, He can advise a
sincere disciple from within. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me."
In conclusion, if a disciple is very serious to execute the mission of the spiritual master, he immediately
associates with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by vani or vapuh. This is the only secret of success in
seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Instead of being eager to see the Lord in some bush of
Vrndavana while at the same time engaging in sense gratification, if one instead sticks to the principle of
following the words of the spiritual master, he will see the Supreme Lord without difficulty. Srila
Bilvamangala Thakura has therefore said:
bhaktis tvayi sthiratara bhagavan yadi syad
daivena nah phalati divya-kisora-murtih
muktih svayam mukulitanjali sevate 'sman
dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksah
"If I am engaged in devotional service unto You, my dear Lord, then very easily can I perceive Your
presence everywhere. And as far as liberation is concerned, I think that liberation stands at my door with
folded hands, waiting to serve me--and all material conveniences of dharma [religiosity], artha [economic
development] and kama [sense gratification] stand with her." (Krsna-karnamrta 107) If one is very highly
advanced in devotional service, he will have no difficulty in seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If
one engages in the service of the spiritual master, he not only sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead
but attains liberation. As far as material conveniences are concerned, they automatically come, just as the
maidservants of a queen follow the queen wherever she goes. Liberation is no problem for the pure
devotee, and all material conveniences are simply awaiting him at all stages of life.
