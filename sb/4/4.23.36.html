namo namo 'niruddhaya
hrsikesendriyatmane
namah paramahamsaya
purnaya nibhrtatmane
SYNONYMS
namah--all my obeisances unto You; namah--obeisances again; aniruddhaya--unto Lord Aniruddha;
hrsikesa--the master of the senses; indriya-atmane--the director of the senses; namah--all obeisances unto
You; parama-hamsaya--unto the supreme perfect; purnaya--unto the supreme complete; nibhrta-atmane--
who is situated apart from this material creation.
TRANSLATION
My Lord, as the supreme directing Deity known as Aniruddha, You are the master of the senses and the
mind. I therefore offer my obeisances unto You again and again. You are known as Ananta as well as
Sankarsana because of Your ability to destroy the whole creation by the blazing fire from Your mouth.
PURPORT
Hrsikesendriyatmane. The mind is the director of the senses, and Lord Aniruddha is the director of the
mind. In order to execute devotional service, one has to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna; therefore
Lord Siva prays to the controller of the mind, Lord Aniruddha, to be pleased to help him engage his mind
on the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.34): man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji
mam. namaskuru. The mind has to be engaged in meditation on the lotus feet of the Lord in order to
execute devotional service. It is also stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca:
from the Lord come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. Thus if Lord Aniruddha is pleased, He
can help the mind engage in the service of the Lord. It is also indicated in this verse that Lord Aniruddha
is the sun-god by virtue of His expansions. Since the predominating deity of the sun is an expansion of
Lord Aniruddha, Lord Siva also prays to the sun-god in this verse.
Lord Krsna, by His quadruple expansion (Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha), is the
Lord of psychic action--namely thinking, feeling, willing and acting. Lord Siva prays to Lord Aniruddha as
the sun-god, who is the controlling deity of the external material elements which constitute the
construction of the material body. According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the word
paramahamsa is also another name for the sun-god. The sun-god is addressed herein as nibhrtatmane,
which indicates that he always maintains the various planets by manipulating the rainfall. The sun-god
evaporates water from the seas and oceans and then forms the water into clouds and distributes it over
land. When there is sufficient rainfall grains are produced, and these grains maintain living entities in
each and every planet. The sun-god is also addressed herein as purna, or complete, because the rays
emanating from the sun have no end. For millions and millions of years since the creation of this
universe, the sun-god has been supplying heat and light without diminution. The word paramahamsa is
applied to persons who are completely cleansed. When there is sufficient sunshine, the mind remains
clear and transparent--in other words, the sun-god helps the mind of the living entity to become situated
on the platform of paramahamsa. Thus Lord Siva prays to Aniruddha to be kind upon him so that his
mind will always be in the perfect state of cleanliness and will be engaged in the devotional service of the
Lord. Just as fire sterilizes all unclean things, the sun-god also keeps everything sterilized, especially dirty
things within the mind, thus enabling one to attain elevation to the platform of spiritual understanding.
