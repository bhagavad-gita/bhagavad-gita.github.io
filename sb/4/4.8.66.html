<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/4/4.8.66.html">4.8.66</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
viksyodha-vayasam tam ca
prakrtinam ca sammatam
anurakta-prajam raja
dhruvam cakre bhuvah patim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
viksya--after seeing; udha-vayasam--mature in age; tam--Dhruva; ca--and; prakrtinam--by the ministers;
ca--also; sammatam--approved of; anurakta--beloved; prajam--by his subjects; raja--the King; dhruvam--
Dhruva Maharaja; cakre--made; bhuvah--of the earth; patim--master.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When, after concentration, King Uttanapada saw that Dhruva Maharaja was suitably mature to take
charge of the kingdom and that his ministers were agreeable and the citizens were also very fond of him,
he enthroned Dhruva as emperor of this planet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although it is misconceived that formerly the monarchial government was autocratic, from the
description of this verse it appears that not only was King Uttanapada a rajarsi, but before installing his
beloved son Dhruva on the throne of the empire of the world, he consulted his ministerial officers,
considered the opinion of the public, and also personally examined Dhruva's character. Then the King
installed him on the throne to take charge of the affairs of the world.
When a Vaisnava king like Dhruva Maharaja is the head of the government of the entire world, the
world is so happy that it is not possible to imagine or describe. Even now, if people would all become
Krsna conscious, the democratic government of the present day would be exactly like the kingdom of
heaven. If all people became Krsna conscious they would vote for persons of the category of Dhruva
Maharaja. If the post of chief executive were occupied by such a Vaisnava, all the problems of satanic
government would be solved. The youthful generation of the present day is very enthusiastic in trying to
overthrow the government in different parts of the world. But unless people are Krsna conscious like
Dhruva Maharaja, there will be no appreciable changes in government because people who hanker to
attain political position by hook or by crook cannot think of the welfare of the people. They are only busy
to keep their position of prestige and monetary gain. They have very little time to think of the welfare of
the citizens.
