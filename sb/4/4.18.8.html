nunam ta virudhah ksina
mayi kalena bhuyasa
tatra yogena drstena
bhavan adatum arhati
SYNONYMS
nunam--therefore; tah--those; virudhah--herbs and grains; ksinah--deteriorated; mayi--within me;
kalena--in course of time; bhuyasa--very much; tatra--therefore; yogena--by proper means; drstena--
acknowledged; bhavan--Your Majesty; adatum--to take; arhati--ought.
TRANSLATION
Due to being stocked for a very long time, all the grain seeds within me have certainly deteriorated.
Therefore you should immediately arrange to take these seeds out by the standard process, which is
recommended by the acaryas or sastras.
PURPORT
When there is a scarcity of grain, the government should follow the methods prescribed in the sastra
and approved by the acaryas; thus there will be a sufficient production of grains, and food scarcity and
famine can be checked. Bhagavad-gita recommends that we perform yajna, sacrifices. By the performance
of yajna, sufficient clouds gather in the sky, and when there are sufficient clouds, there is also sufficient
rainfall. In this way agricultural matters are taken care of. When there is sufficient grain production, the
general populace eats the grains, and animals like cows, goats and other domestic animals eat the grasses
and grains also. According to this arrangement, human beings should perform the sacrifices
recommended in the sastras, and if they do so there will no longer be food scarcity. In Kali-yuga, the only
sacrifice recommended is sankirtana-yajna.
In this verse there are two significant words: yogena, "by the approved method," and drstena, "as
exemplified by the former acaryas." One is mistaken if he thinks that by applying modern machines such
as tractors, grains can be produced. If one goes to a desert and uses a tractor, there is still no possibility of
producing grains. We may adopt various means, but it is essential to know that the planet earth will stop
producing grains if sacrifices are not performed. The earth has already explained that because
nondevotees are enjoying the production of food, she has reserved food seeds for the performance of
sacrifice. Now, of course, atheists will not believe in this spiritual method of producing grains, but
whether they believe or not, the fact remains that we are not independent to produce grain by mechanical
means. As far as the approved method is concerned, it is enjoined in the sastras that intelligent men in
this age will take to the sankirtana movement, and by so doing they shall worship the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Lord Caitanya, whose bodily complexion is golden and who is always
accompanied by His confidential devotees to preach this Krsna consciousness movement all over the
world. In its present condition, the world can only be saved by introducing this sankirtana, this Krsna
consciousness movement. As we have learned from the previous verse, one who is not in Krsna
consciousness is considered a thief. Even though he may be materially very advanced, a thief cannot be
placed in a comfortable position. A thief is a thief, and he is punishable. Because people are without Krsna
consciousness, they have become thieves, and consequently they are being punished by the laws of
material nature. No one can check this, not even by introducing so many relief funds and humanitarian
institutions. Unless the people of the world take to Krsna consciousness, there will be a scarcity of food
and much suffering.
TEXTS 9-10
vatsam kalpaya me vira
yenaham vatsala tava
dhoksye ksiramayan kaman
anurupam ca dohanam
dogdharam ca maha-baho
bhutanam bhuta-bhavana
annam ipsitam urjasvad
bhagavan vanchate yadi
SYNONYMS
vatsam--a calf; kalpaya--arrange; me--for me; vira--O hero; yena--by which; aham--I; vatsala--
affectionate; tava--your; dhoksye--shall fulfill; ksira-mayan--in the form of milk; kaman--desired
necessities; anurupam--according to different living entities; ca--also; dohanam--milking pot; dogdharam--
milkman; ca--also; maha-baho--O mighty-armed one; bhutanam--of all living entities; bhuta-bhavana--O
protector of the living entities; annam--food grains; ipsitam--desired; urjah-vat--nourishing; bhagavan--
your worshipable self; vanchate--desires; yadi--if.
TRANSLATION
O great hero, protector of living entities, if you desire to relieve the living entities by supplying them
sufficient grain, and if you desire to nourish them by taking milk from me, you should make
arrangements to bring a calf suitable for this purpose and a pot in which the milk can be kept, as well as a
milkman to do the work. Since I will be very much affectionate towards my calf, your desire to take milk
from me will be fulfilled.
PURPORT
These are nice instructions for milking a cow. The cow must first have a calf so that out of affection for
the calf she will voluntarily give sufficient milk. There must also be an expert milkman and a suitable pot
in which to keep the milk. Just as a cow cannot deliver sufficient milk without being affectionate to her
calf, the earth cannot produce sufficient necessities without feeling affection for those who are Krsna
conscious. Even though the earth's being in the shape of a cow may be taken figuratively, the meaning
herein is very explicit. Just as a calf can derive milk from a cow, all living entities--including animals,
birds, bees, reptiles and aquatics--can receive their respective foods from the planet earth, provided that
human beings are not asat, or adhrta-vrata, as we have previously discussed. When human society
becomes asat, or ungodly, or devoid of Krsna consciousness, the entire world suffers. If human beings are
well-behaved, animals will also receive sufficient food and be happy. The ungodly human being, ignorant
of his duty to give protection and food to the animals, kills them to compensate for the insufficient
production of grains. Thus no one is satisfied, and that is the cause for the present condition in today's
world.
