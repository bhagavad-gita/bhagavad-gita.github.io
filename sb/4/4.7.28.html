<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Dhruva, if you feel that your sense of honor has been insulted, you still have no cause for
dissatisfaction. This kind of dissatisfaction is another feature of the illusory energy; every living entity is
controlled by his previous actions, and therefore there are different varieties of life for enjoying or
suffering.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Vedas it is said that the living entity is always uncontaminated and unaffected by material
association. The living entity gets different types of material bodies because of his previous fruitive
actions. If, however, one understands the philosophy that as a living spirit soul he has an affinity for
neither suffering nor enjoyment, then he is considered to be a liberated person. It is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (18.54), brahma-bhutah prasannatma: when one is actually situated on the transcendental
platform, he has nothing for which to lament and nothing for which to hanker. Narada Rsi first of all
wanted to impress upon Dhruva Maharaja that he was only a child; he should not have been affected by
words of insult or honor. And if he were so developed as to understand honor and insult, then this
understanding should have been applied in his own life; he should have known that honor and dishonor
are both destined only by one's previous actions; therefore one should not be sorry or happy under any
circumstances.
