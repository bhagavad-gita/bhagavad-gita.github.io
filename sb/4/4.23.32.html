<h2>Text</h2>
narada uvaca
ittham puranjanam nari
yacamanam adhiravat
abhyanandata tam viram
hasanti vira mohita
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
naradah uvaca--the great sage Narada continued to speak; ittham--upon this; puranjanam--unto
Puranjana; nari--the woman; yacamanam--begging; adhira-vat--being too impatient; abhyanandata--she
addressed; tam--him; viram--the hero; hasanti--smiling; vira--O hero; mohita--being attracted by him.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada continued: My dear King, when Puranjana became so attracted and impatient to touch the girl
and enjoy her, the girl also became attracted by his words and accepted his request by smiling. By this
time she was certainly attracted by the King.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By this incident we can understand that when a man is aggressive and begins to woo a woman, the
woman becomes attracted to the man. This process is described in the Bhagavatam (5.5.8) as pumsah
striya mithuni-bhavam etam. This attraction is enacted on the platform of sexual life. Thus the sex
impulse is the platform of material engagement. This conditional life, the platform of material sense
enjoyment, is the cause of forgetfulness of spiritual life. In this way a living entity's original Krsna
consciousness becomes covered or converted into material consciousness. Thus one engages in the
business of sense gratification.
