<h2>Translation</h2>
Both the queens of King Uttanapada, namely Suniti and Suruci, along with his other son, Uttama,
appeared in the procession. The queens were seated on a palanquin.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After the departure of Dhruva Maharaja from the palace, the King was very afflicted, but by the kind
words of Saint Narada he was partially satisfied. He could understand the great fortune of his wife Suniti
and the great misfortune of Queen Suruci, for these facts were certainly very open in the palace. But still
when the news reached the palace that Dhruva Maharaja was returning, his mother, Suniti, out of her
great compassion and due to being the mother of a great Vaisnava, did not hesitate to take the other wife,
Suruci, and her son, Uttama, on the same palanquin. That was the greatness of Queen Suniti, the mother
of the great Vaisnava Dhruva Maharaja.
