aviskrtam nah klistanam
kim anyad anukampitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

sanksayam--which dissipates; aviskrtam--revealed; nah--of us; klistanam--who are suffering from material

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, we conditioned souls are always covered by ignorance in the bodily conception of life. We
therefore always prefer the miserable conditions of material existence. To deliver us from these miserable
conditions, You have advented Yourself in this transcendental form. This is evidence of Your unlimited
causeless mercy upon those of us who are suffering in this way. What, then, to speak of the devotees to
whom You are always so favorably disposed?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord appears in His original form, He acts to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants
(Bg. 4.8). Although He annihilates the demons, He nonetheless benefits them. It is said that all the living
entities who died on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra attained their original constitutional position (svarupa)
because they had the chance to see Krsna face to face riding in the chariot of Arjuna. On the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra, superficially two things were going on--the demons were being killed, and the devotee,
Arjuna, was being protected. However, the results were the same for everyone. Thus it is said that the
appearance of the Lord diminishes all kinds of miserable conditions caused by material existence.
It is clearly stated in this verse that this form (asesa-klesa-sanksayam) is meant to diminish all the
miserable conditions experienced in life not only by the devotees but by all others. Aviskrtam nah
klistanam. The Pracetas identified themselves as common men. Kim anyad anukampitam. The devotees
are always favorably accepted by the Lord. The Lord shows all mercy not only to conditioned souls but
also to the devotees, who are already liberated due to their devotional service.
The form of the Lord as worshiped in the temples is called arca-vigraha or arcavatara, the worshipable
form, the Deity incarnation. This facility is offered to neophyte devotees so that they can see the real form
of the Lord face to face and offer their respectful obeisances and sacrifices in the form of arca. Through
such facilities the neophytes gradually invoke their original Krsna consciousness. Deity worship in the
form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners. All neophytes
must therefore engage in the worship of the Lord by keeping the arca-vigraha (arcavatara) at home or in
the temple.
