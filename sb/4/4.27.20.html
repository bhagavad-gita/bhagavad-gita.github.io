<h2>Translation</h2>
Always engaging in the activities of devotional service, devotees feel ever-increasingly fresh and new in
all their activities. The all-knower, the Supersoul within the heart of the devotee, makes everything
increasingly fresh. This is known as the Brahman position by the advocates of the Absolute Truth. In such
a liberated stage [brahma-bhuta], one is never bewildered. Nor does one lament or become unnecessarily
jubilant. This is due to the brahma-bhuta situation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee is inspired by the Supersoul within the heart to advance in devotional service in a variety of
ways. The devotee does not feel hackneyed or stereotyped, nor does he feel that he is in a stagnant
position. In the material world, if one engages in chanting a material name, he will feel tired after
chanting a few times. However, one can chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra all day and night and never
feel tired. As chanting is increased, it will come out new and fresh. Srila Rupa Gosvami said that if he
could somehow get millions of ears and tongues, then he could relish spiritual bliss by chanting the Hare
Krsna maha-mantra. There is really nothing uninspiring for a highly advanced devotee. In Bhagavad-gita
the Lord says that He is situated in everyone's heart and that He helps the living entity forget and
remember. By the grace of the Lord, the devotee gets inspiration.
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me." (Bg. 10.10)
As stated (kusala-karmanam), those engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service are guided by
the Supersoul, described in this verse as jna, one who knows everything, past, present and future. The
Supersoul gives instructions to the sincere, unalloyed devotee on how he can progress more and more in
approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila Jiva Gosvami in this connection says that the
Supersoul, the plenary expansion of the Personality of Godhead, exists in everyone's heart, but in the
heart of the devotee He reveals Himself as ever-increasingly new. Being inspired by Him, the devotee
experiences increased transcendental bliss in the execution of his devotional service.
