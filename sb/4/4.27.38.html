<h2>Text</h2>
vayam tu saksad bhagavan bhavasya
priyasya sakhyuh ksana-sangamena
suduscikitsyasya bhavasya mrtyor
bhisaktamam tvadya gatim gatah sma
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vayam--we; tu--then; saksat--directly; bhagavan--O Lord; bhavasya--of Lord Siva; priyasya--very dear;
sakhyuh--Your friend; ksana--for a moment; sangamena--by association; suduscikitsyasya--very difficult
to cure; bhavasya--of material existence; mrtyoh--of death; bhisak-tamam--the most expert physician;
tva--You; adya--today; gatim--destination; gatah--have achieved; sma--certainly.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, by virtue of a moment's association with Lord Siva, who is very dear to You and who is Your
most intimate friend, we were fortunate to attain You. You are the most expert physician, capable of
treating the incurable disease of material existence. On account of our great fortune, we have been able to
take shelter at Your lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has been said: harim vina na srtim taranti. Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of
Godhead, one cannot attain relief from the clutches of maya, the repetition of birth, old age, disease and
death. The Pracetas received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of Lord Siva.
Lord Siva is the supreme devotee of Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vaisnavanam yatha
sambhuh: the most exalted Vaisnava is Lord Siva, and those who are actually devotees of Lord Siva follow
Lord Siva's advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Visnu. The so-called devotees of Lord Siva,
who are simply after material prosperity, are in a way deceived by Lord Siva. He does not actually deceive
them, because Lord Siva has no business deceiving people, but because the so-called devotees of Lord Siva
want to be deceived, Lord Siva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedictions.
These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the so-called devotees. For instance,
Ravana took all material benediction from Lord Siva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed
with his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord Siva's benediction. Because of his
material power, he became very proud and puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord
Ramacandra. In this way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord Siva is not difficult, but
actually these are not benedictions. The Pracetas received benediction from Lord Siva, and as a result they
attained the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Visnu. This is real benediction. The gopis also worshiped
Lord Siva in Vrndavana, and the lord is still staying there as Gopisvara. The gopis, however, prayed that
Lord Siva bless them by giving them Lord Krsna as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the
demigods, provided that one's aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the
demigods for material benefit, as indicated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20):
kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah
prapadyante 'nya-devatah
tam tam niyamam asthaya
prakrtya niyatah svaya
"Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the
particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures." One enamored by material
benefits is called hrta jnana ("one who has lost his intelligence"). In this connection it is to be noted that
sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord Siva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord Siva and Lord Visnu are so intimately connected that there
is no difference in opinion. The actual fact is, ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya: "The only supreme
master is Krsna, and all others are His devotees or servants." (Cc. Adi 5.142) This is the real fact, and
there is no difference of opinion between Lord Siva and Lord Visnu in this connection. Nowhere in
revealed scripture does Lord Siva claim to be equal to Lord Visnu. This is simply the creation of the socalled
devotees of Lord Siva, who claim that Lord Siva and Lord Visnu are one. This is strictly forbidden
in the Vaisnava-tantra: yas tu narayanam devam. Lord Visnu, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are intimately
connected as master and servants. Siva-virinci-nutam. Visnu is honored and offered obeisances by Lord
Siva and Lord Brahma. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense
that Lord Visnu is the Supreme personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brahmanas,
advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects
to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone
severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of
ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction. We pray for this benediction only, and nothing more.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, samsiddhir hari-tosanam: the real perfection of life is pleasing the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: in understanding the Vedas, one has
to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually understood Him surrenders
unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracetas. They underwent severe
austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They
practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One
may engage in any business--material or spiritual--but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People
training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also
to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are Aryans and actual devotees of the Lord. An Aryan is one
who does not boast, but is an actual devotee of the Lord. Aryan means "advanced." Formerly, those who
claimed to be Aryans had to be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in Bhagavad-gita (2.2) Krsna chastised
Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-Aryan.
sri-bhagavan uvaca
kutas tva kasmalam idam
visame samupasthitam
anarya-justam asvargyam
akirti-karam arjuna
"The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you?
They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher
planets, but to infamy." Arjuna, the ksatriya, was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the
Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-Aryan family. Anyone who is
advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his
duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed.
An Aryan performs his duty. It is not that the Aryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The
Aryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracetas
underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and
penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization.
The word nirandhasam means "without food." Eating voraciously and unnecessarily is not the business
of an Aryan. Rather, the eating process should be restricted as far as possible. When Aryans eat, they eat
only prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." Thus there are
restrictions for the advanced Aryans. Although the Lord Himself can eat anything and everything, He
restricts Himself to vegetables, fruits, milk and so on. This verse thus describes the activities of those who
claim to be Aryans.
