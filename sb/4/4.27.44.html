<h2>Text</h2>
atha niryaya salilat
pracetasa udanvatah
viksyakupyan drumais channam
gam gam roddhum ivocchritaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--thereafter; niryaya--after coming out; salilat--from the water; pracetasah--all the Pracetas;
udanvatah--of the sea; viksya--having observed; akupyan--became very angry; drumaih--by trees;
channam--covered; gam--the world; gam--the heavenly planets; roddhum--to obstruct; iva--as if;
ucchritaih--very tall.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter all the Pracetas emerged from the waters of the sea. They then saw that all the trees on land
had grown very tall, as if to obstruct the path to the heavenly planets. These trees had covered the entire
surface of the world. At this time the Pracetas became very angry.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Pracinabarhisat left his kingdom before his sons arrived after their execution of penance and
austerity. The sons, the Pracetas, were ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to come out of the
water and go to the kingdom of their father in order to take care of that kingdom. However, when they
came out, they saw that everything had been neglected due to the King's absence. They first observed that
food grains were not being produced and that there were no agricultural activities. Indeed, the surface of
the world was practically covered by very tall trees. It seemed as though the trees were determined to stop
people from going into outer space to reach the heavenly kingdoms. The Pracetas became very angry
when they saw the surface of the globe covered in this way. They desired that the land be cleared for
crops.
It is not a fact that jungles and trees attract clouds and rain, because we find rainfall over the sea.
Human beings can inhabit any place on the surface of the earth by clearing jungles and converting land
for agricultural purposes. People can keep cows, and all economic problems can be solved in that way.
One need only work to produce grains and take care of the cows. The wood found in the jungles may be
used for constructing cottages. In this way the economic problem of humanity can be solved. At the
present moment there are many vacant lands throughout the world, and if they are properly utilized,
there will be no scarcity of food. As far as rain is concerned, it is the performance of yajna that attracts
rain. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.14):
annad bhavanti bhutani
parjanyad anna-sambhavah
yajnad bhavati parjanyo
yajnah karma-samudbhavah
"All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by
performance of yajna [sacrifice], and yajna is born of prescribed duties." By performing sacrifice, man will
have sufficient rainfall and crops.
