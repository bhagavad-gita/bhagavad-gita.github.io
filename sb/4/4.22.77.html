<h2>Text</h2>
vindate puruso 'musmad
yad yad icchaty asatvaram
mad-gita-gitat supritac
chreyasam eka-vallabhat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vindate--achieves; purusah--a devotee; amusmat--from the Personality of Godhead; yat yat--that which;
icchati--desires; asatvaram--being fixed; mat-gita--sung by me; gitat--by the song; su-pritat--from the Lord,
who is very pleased; sreyasam--of all benediction; eka--one; vallabhat--from the dearmost.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dearmost objective of all auspicious benedictions. A human
being who sings this song sung by me can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee,
being fixed in the Lord's devotional service, can acquire whatever he wants from the Supreme Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.22), yam labdhva caparam labham manyate nadhikam tatah: if one can
attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has nothing to aspire for, nor does he desire
any other gain. When Dhruva Maharaja became perfect by austerity and saw the Supreme Personality of
Godhead face to face, he was offered any kind of benediction he wanted. However, Dhruva replied that he
did not want anything, for he was perfectly satisfied with the benediction of seeing the Lord. Except for
the service of the Supreme Lord, whatever we want is called illusion, maya. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa' (Cc. Madhya 20.108). Every living entity is an eternal servant of
the Lord; therefore when one engages in the service of the Lord, he realizes the highest perfection of life.
A faithful servant can fulfill any desire by the grace of the master, and one who engages in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord has nothing to aspire for separately. All his desires are fulfilled
simply by engaging constantly in the Lord's loving service. Lord Siva shows us that any devotee can be
successful simply by chanting the prayers which he has recited.
