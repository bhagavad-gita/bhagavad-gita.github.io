<p></p>

balanam--of the children; varnaye--I regard; na--not; anucintaye--I consider; deva-maya--the external

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva said: My dear father, Brahma, I do not mind the offenses created by the demigods. Because
these demigods are childish and less intelligent, I do not take a serious view of their offenses, and I have
punished them only in order to right them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are two types of punishment. One is that which a conqueror imposes on an enemy, and the other
is like that a father imposes on his son. There is a gulf of difference between these two kinds of
punishment. Lord Siva is by nature a Vaisnava, a great devotee, and his name in this connection is
Asutosa. He is always satisfied, and therefore he did not become angry as if he were an enemy. He is not
inimical to any living entity; rather, he always wishes the welfare of all. Whenever he chastises a person, it
is just like a father's punishment of his son. Lord Siva is like a father because he never takes seriously any
offense by any living entities, especially the demigods.
