<h2>Text</h2>

vatsalyal loka-mangalam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vidya--knowledge; tapah--austerity; yoga-patham--the path of devotional service; asthitam--situated;
tam--him (Lord Siva); adhisvaram--the master of the senses; carantam--performing (austerity, etc.); visvasuhrdam--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods saw Lord Siva situated in his perfection as the master of the senses, knowledge, fruitive
activities and the path of achieving perfection. He was the friend of the entire world, and by virtue of his
full affection for everyone, he was very auspicious.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva is full of wisdom and tapasya, austerity. One who knows the modes of work is understood to
be situated on the path of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One cannot serve
the Supreme Personality of Godhead unless one has achieved full perfectional knowledge in the ways and
means of performing devotional service.
Lord Siva is described here as adhisvara. Isvara means "controller," and adhisvara means particularly
"controller of the senses." Generally our materially contaminated senses are apt to engage in sense
gratificatory activities, but when a person is elevated by wisdom and austerity, the senses then become
purified, and they become engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Siva is the
emblem of such perfection, and therefore in the scriptures it is said, vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh: Lord
Siva is a Vaisnava. Lord Siva, by his actions within this material world, teaches all conditioned souls how
to engage in devotional service twenty-four hours a day. Therefore he is described here as loka-mangala,
good fortune personified for all conditioned souls.
