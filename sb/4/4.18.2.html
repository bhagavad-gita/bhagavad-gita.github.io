<h2>Text</h2>
tad abhipretya bhagavan
karmatisayam atmanah
sata-kratur na mamrse
prthor yajna-mahotsavam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat abhipretya--considering this matter; bhagavan--the most powerful; karma-atisayam--excelling in
fruitive activities; atmanah--of himself; sata-kratuh--King Indra, who had performed a hundred sacrifices;
na--not; mamrse--did tolerate; prthoh--of King Prthu; yajna--sacrificial; maha-utsavam--great ceremonies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the most powerful Indra, the King of heaven, saw this, he considered the fact that King Prthu was
going to exceed him in fruitive activities. Thus Indra could not tolerate the great sacrificial ceremonies
performed by King Prthu.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world everyone who comes to enjoy himself or lord it over material nature is envious of
others. This envy is also found in the personality of the King of heaven, Indra. As evident from revealed
scriptures, Indra was several times envious of many persons. He was especially envious of great fruitive
activities and the execution of yoga practices, or siddhis. Indeed, he could not tolerate them, and he
desired to break them up. He was envious due to fear that those who performed great sacrifices for the
execution of mystic yoga might occupy his seat. Since no one in this material world can tolerate another's
advancement, everyone in the material world is called matsara, envious. In the beginning of Srimad-
Bhagavatam it is therefore said that Srimad-Bhagavatam is meant for those who are completely nirmatsara
(nonenvious). In other words, one who is not free from the contamination of envy cannot advance in
Krsna consciousness. In Krsna consciousness, however, if someone excels another person, the devotee
who is excelled thinks how fortunate the other person is to be advancing in devotional service. Such
nonenvy is typical of Vaikuntha. However, when one is envious of his competitor, that is material. The
demigods posted in the material world are not exempt from envy.
