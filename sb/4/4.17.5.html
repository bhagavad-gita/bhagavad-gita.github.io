sanat-kumarad bhagavato
brahman brahma-vid-uttamat
labdhva jnanam sa-vijnanam
rajarsih kam gatim gatah
SYNONYMS
sanat-kumarat--from Sanat-kumara; bhagavatah--the most powerful; brahman--my dear brahmana;
brahma-vit-uttamat--well versed in the Vedic knowledge; labdhva--after achieving; jnanam--knowledge;
sa-vijnanam--for practical application; raja-rsih--the great saintly King; kam--which; gatim--destination;
gatah--achieved.
TRANSLATION
The great saintly King, Maharaja Prthu, received knowledge from Sanat-kumara, who was the greatest
Vedic scholar. After receiving knowledge to be applied practically in his life, how did the saintly King
attain his desired destination?
PURPORT
There are four Vaisnava sampradayas (systems) of disciplic succession. One sampradaya comes from
Lord Brahma, one from the goddess of fortune, one from the Kumaras, headed by Sanat-kumara, and one
from Lord Siva. These four systems of disciplic succession are still going on. As King Prthu has illustrated,
one who is serious about receiving transcendental Vedic knowledge must accept a guru, or spiritual
master, in one of these four disciplic successions. It is said that unless one accepts a mantra from one of
these sampradayas, the so-called mantra will not act in Kali-yuga. Many sampradayas have sprung up
without authority, and they are misleading the people by giving unauthorized mantras. The rascals of
these so-called sampradayas do not observe the Vedic rules and regulations. Although they are addicted to
all kinds of sinful activities, they still offer the people mantras and thus mislead them. Intelligent persons,
however, know that such mantras will never be successful, and as such they never patronize such upstart
spiritual groups. People should be very careful of these nonsensical sampradayas. To get some facility for
sense gratification, unfortunate people in this age receive mantras from these so-called sampradayas.
Prthu Maharaja, however, showed by his example that one should receive knowledge from a bona fide
sampradaya. Therefore Maharaja Prthu accepted Sanat-kumara as his spiritual master.

much attentive; tava--of you; ca--and; adhoksajasya--of the Lord, who is known as Adhoksaja; ca--also;
vaktum arhasi--please narrate; yah--one who; aduhyat--milked; vainya-rupena--in the form of the son of
King Vena; gam--cow, earth; imam--this.
TRANSLATION
Prthu Maharaja was a powerful incarnation of Lord Krsna's potencies; consequently any narration
concerning his activities is surely very pleasing to hear, and it produces all good fortune. As far as I am
concerned, I am always your devotee as well as a devotee of the Lord, who is known as Adhoksaja. Please
therefore narrate all the stories of King Prthu, who, in the form of the son of King Vena, milked the cowshaped
earth.
PURPORT
Lord Krsna is also known as avatari, which means, "one from whom all the incarnations emanate." In
Bhagavad-gita (10.8) Lord Krsna says, aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate: "I am the
source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me." Thus Lord Krsna is the origin
of everyone's appearance. As far as this material world is concerned, Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord
Siva are all emanations from Krsna. These three incarnations of Krsna are called guna-avataras. The
material world is governed by three material modes of nature, and Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva respectively take charge of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Maharaja Prthu is also an
incarnation of those qualities of Lord Krsna by which one rules over conditioned souls.
In this verse the word adhoksaja, meaning "beyond the perception of the material senses," is very
significant. No one can perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead by mental speculation; therefore a
person with a poor fund of knowledge cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since one
can form only an impersonal idea on the strength of one's material senses, the Lord is known as
Adhoksaja.
