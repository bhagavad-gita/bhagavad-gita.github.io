<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tan anadrtya yo 'vidvan
arthan arabhate svayam
tasya vyabhicaranty artha
arabdhas ca punah punah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan--those; anadrtya--neglecting; yah--anyone who; avidvan--rascal; arthan--schemes; arabhate--begins;
svayam--personally; tasya--his; vyabhicaranti--do not become successful; arthah--purposes; arabdhah--
attempted; ca--and; punah punah--again and again.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A foolish person who manufactures his own ways and means through mental speculation and does not
recognize the authority of the sages who lay down unimpeachable directions is simply unsuccessful again
and again in his attempts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the present moment it has become fashionable to disobey the unimpeachable directions given by the
acaryas and liberated souls of the past. Presently people are so fallen that they cannot distinguish between
a liberated soul and a conditioned soul. A conditioned soul is hampered by four defects: he is sure to
commit mistakes, he is sure to become illusioned, he has a tendency to cheat others, and his senses are
imperfect. Consequently we have to take direction from liberated persons. This Krsna consciousness
movement directly receives instructions from the Supreme personality of Godhead via persons who are
strictly following His instructions. Although a follower may not be a liberated person, if he follows the
supreme, liberated Personality of Godhead, his actions are naturally liberated from the contamination of
the material nature. Lord Caitanya therefore says: "By My order you may become a spiritual master." One
can immediately become a spiritual master by having full faith in the transcendental words of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and by following His instructions. Materialistic men are not interested in
taking directions from a liberated person, but they are very much interested in their own concocted ideas,
which make them repeatedly fail in their attempts. Because the entire world is now following the
imperfect directions of conditioned souls, humanity is completely bewildered.
