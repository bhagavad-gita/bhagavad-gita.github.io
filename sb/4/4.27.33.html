<h2>Text</h2>
yavat te mayaya sprsta
bhramama iha karmabhih
tavad bhavat-prasanganam
sangah syan no bhave bhave
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yavat--as long as; te--Your; mayaya--by the illusory energy; sprstah--contaminated; bhramamah--we
wander; iha--in this material world; karmabhih--by the reaction of fruitive activities; tavat--so long;
bhavat-prasanganam--of Your loving devotees; sangah--association; syat--let there be; nah--our; bhave
bhave--in every species of life.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, as long as we have to remain within this material world due to our material contamination
and wander from one type of body to another and from one planet to another, we pray that we may
associate with those who are engaged in discussing Your pastimes. We pray for this benediction life after
life, in different bodily forms and on different planets.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the best benediction that a devotee can ask of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu: sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhih (Bhag. 10.14.3). One may be in one
position or another according to destiny, but in any case one must continue to hear about the activities
and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, regardless of circumstances. A pure devotee does not pray for
liberation or for cessation of the cycle of birth and death because he does not consider that important. The
most important thing for a devotee is getting a chance to hear about the pastimes and glories of the Lord.
The devotees who engage in the service of the Lord in this world will have the same opportunity in the
spiritual world also. Thus for a devotee, everything is in the spiritual world, for as long as he can hear
about the pastimes of the Lord, or wherever he can chant, the Lord is personally present. Tatra tisthami
narada yatra gayanti mad-bhaktah. When the pure devotees assemble to chant, hear and talk about the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the place where they assemble becomes Vaikuntha. For the devotee
there is no need to pray to the Lord for transferal to the Vaikuntha world. A pure devotee can create
Vaikuntha or Vrndavana anywhere simply by chanting the glories of the Lord without offense.
The Pracetas pray for an opportunity to hear of the glories of the Lord in every form of life (bhave
bhave). A living entity transmigrates from one body to another. The devotee is not particularly eager to
stop this process. Caitanya Mahaprabhu prays, mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki
tvayi: "My dear Lord, life after life may I be fixed in Your pure devotional service." Out of humility, a
devotee considers himself unfit to be transferred to the spiritual world. He always thinks himself
contaminated by the modes of material nature. Nor is there any need for a devotee to ask to be freed from
the modes of material nature. Devotional service itself is in the transcendental position; therefore there is
no question of asking for this special facility. The conclusion is that a pure devotee is not anxious to stop
the repetition of birth and death, but is always eager to associate with other devotees who are engaged in
chanting and hearing about the glories of the Lord.
