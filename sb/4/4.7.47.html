<h2>Text</h2>
srivatsankam ghana-syamam

sankha-cakra-gada-padmair
abhivyakta-caturbhujam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
srivatsa-ankam--the mark of Srivatsa on the chest of the Lord; ghana-syamam--deeply bluish; purusam--
the Supreme Person; vana-malinam--with a garland of flowers; sankha--conchshell; cakra--wheel; gada--
club; padmaih--lotus flower; abhivyakta--manifested; catuh-bhujam--four handed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord is further described as having the mark of Srivatsa, or the sitting place of the goddess of
fortune, and His bodily hue is deep bluish. The Lord is a person, He wears a garland of flowers, and He is
eternally manifest with four hands, which hold [beginning from the lower left hand] a conchshell, wheel,
club and lotus flower.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here in this verse the word purusam is very significant. The Lord is never female. He is always male
(purusa). Therefore the impersonalist who imagines the Lord's form as that of a woman is mistaken. The
Lord appears in female form if necessary, but His perpetual form is purusa because He is originally male.
The feminine feature of the Lord is displayed by goddesses of fortune--Laksmi, Radharani, Sita, etc. All
these goddesses of fortune are servitors of the Lord; they are not the Supreme, as falsely imagined by the
impersonalist. Lord Krsna in His Narayana feature is always four handed. On the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra, when Arjuna wanted to see His universal form, He showed this feature of four-handed
Narayana. Some devotees are of the opinion that Krsna is an incarnation of Narayana, but the Bhagavata
school says that Narayana is a manifestation of Krsna.
