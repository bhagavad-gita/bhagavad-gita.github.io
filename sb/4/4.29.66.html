<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, all good fortune unto you! The mind is the cause of the living entity's attaining a certain type of
body in accordance with his association with material nature. According to one's mental composition, one
can understand what the living entity was in his past life as well as what kind of body he will have in the
future. Thus the mind indicates the past and future bodies.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The mind is the index of information about one's past and future lives. If a man is a devotee of the Lord,
he cultivated devotional service in his previous life. Similarly, if one's mind is criminal, he was criminal in
his last life. In the same way, according to the mind, we can understand what will happen in a future life.
In Bhagavad-gita (14.18) it is said:
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode
of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."
If a person is in the mode of goodness, his mental activities will promote him to a higher planetary
system. Similarly, if he has a low mentality, his future life will be most abominable. The lives of the living
entity, in both the past and the future, are indicated by the mental condition. Narada Muni is herein
offering the King blessings of all good fortune so that the King will not desire anything or make plans for
sense gratification. The King was engaged in fruitive ritualistic ceremonies because he hoped to get a
better life in the future. Narada Muni desired him to give up all mental concoctions. As explained before,
all bodies in heavenly planets and hellish planets arise from mental concoctions, and the sufferings and
enjoyments of material life are simply on the mental platform. They take place on the chariot of the mind
(mano-ratha). It is therefore said:
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
mano-rathenasati dhavato bahih
"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the
demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications, that are of little
value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring
material energy." (Bhag. 5.18.12)
Unless one becomes a devotee of the Lord, or becomes fully Krsna conscious, he will certainly hover on
the mental platform and be promoted and degraded in different types of bodies. All qualities that are
considered good according to the material estimation actually have no value because these so-called good
qualities will not save a person from the cycle of birth and death. The conclusion is that one should be
without mental desire. Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam: one should be fully free from
material desires, philosophical speculation and fruitive activity. The best course for a human being is to
favorably accept the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of
human life.
