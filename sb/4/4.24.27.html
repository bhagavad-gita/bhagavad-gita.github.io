<h2>Text</h2>
kala-kanyodita-vaco
nisamya yavanesvarah
cikirsur deva-guhyam sa
sasmitam tam abhasata
<p></p>

the King of the Yavanas; cikirsuh--desiring to execute; deva--of providence; guhyam--confidential
duty; sah--he; sa-smitam--smilingly; tam--her; abhasata--addressed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After hearing the statement of Kalakanya, daughter of Time, the King of the Yavanas began to smile and
devise a means for executing his confidential duty on behalf of providence. He then addressed Kalakanya
as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.142) it is said:
ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya
yare yaiche nacaya, se taiche kare nrtya
Actually the supreme controller is the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and everyone is His servant.
Yavana-raja, the King of the Yavanas, was also a servant of Krsna. Consequently, he wanted to execute the
purpose of Krsna through the agency of Kalakanya. Although Kalakanya means invalidity or old age,
Yavana-raja wanted to serve Krsna by introducing Kalakanya everywhere. Thus a sane person, by attaining
old age, will become fearful of death. Foolish people engage in material activities as if they will live
forever and enjoy material advancement, but actually there is no material advancement. Under illusion
people think that material opulence will save them, but although there has been much advancement in
material science, the problems of human society--birth, death, old age and disease--are still unsolved.
Nonetheless foolish scientists are thinking that they have advanced materially. When Kalakanya, the
invalidity of old age, attacks them, they become fearful of death, if they are sane. Those who are insane
simply do not care for death, nor do they know what is going to happen after death. They are under the
wrong impression that after death there is no life, and consequently they act very irresponsibly in this life
and enjoy unrestricted sense gratification. For an intelligent person, the appearance of old age is an
impetus to spiritual life. People naturally fear impending death. The King of the Yavanas tried to utilize
Kalakanya for this purpose.
