<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Barhaspatya, what did the sons of King Barhisat, known as the Pracetas, obtain after meeting
Lord Siva, who is very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the bestower of liberation? Certainly
they were transferred to the spiritual world, but apart from that, what did they obtain within this material
world, either in this life or in other lives?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All types of material happiness are obtained in this life or in the next life, on this planet or on another.
The living entity wanders within this material universe in so many species of life and so many planetary
systems. The distress and happiness obtained during the span of life are called iha, and the distress and
happiness obtained in the next life are called paratra.
Actually, Lord Mahadeva (Siva) is one of the great demigods within this material world. Generally his
blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean material happiness. The predominating deity of this material
world, Durga, is under the control of Lord Mahadeva, Girisa. Thus Lord Mahadeva can offer anyone any
kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to become devotees of Lord Girisa to obtain material
happiness, but the Pracetas met Lord Mahadeva by providential arrangement. Lord Mahadeva instructed
them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he personally offered a prayer. As stated in the
previous verse (rudra-gitena), simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord Siva to Visnu, the Pracetas
were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy material happiness also;
therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to
enjoy the material world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee is
transferred to a heavenly planet--to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Siddhaloka and so on. However, a
pure devotee never aspires for any kind of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently
transferred directly to Vaikunthaloka, which is described here as param. In this verse Vidura asks
Maitreya, the disciple of Brhaspati, about the different achievements of the Pracetas.
