<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni continued to speak to King Pracinabarhisat: My dear King, any person who works
according to the directions of the Vedic scriptures does not become involved in fruitive activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Just as a government may issue trade licenses in order for its citizens to act in a certain way, the Vedas
contain injunctions that restrain and regulate all of our fruitive activities. All living entities have come
into this material world to enjoy themselves. Consequently, the Vedas are given to regulate sense
enjoyment. One who enjoys his senses under the Vedic regulative principles does not become entangled
in the actions and reactions of his activities. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmanah: one
should act only for the performance of yajna, or to satisfy Lord Visnu. Anyatra loko 'yam karmabandhanah:
otherwise any action will produce a reaction by which the living entity will be bound. A
human being is especially meant to attain liberation from the bondage of birth, death, old age and disease.
He is therefore directed by the Vedic regulative principles to work in such a way that he may fulfill his
desires for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become freed from material bondage. Action
according to such principles is called knowledge. Indeed, the word veda means "knowledge." The words
jnanena na sa lipyate indicate that by following the Vedic principles, one does not become involved in the
actions and reactions of his fruitive activities.
Everyone is therefore advised to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions and not irresponsibly. When a
person within a state acts according to the laws and licenses of the government, he does not become
involved in criminal activities. Man-made laws, however, are always defective because they are made by
men who are prone to committing mistakes, being illusioned, cheating and having imperfect senses. The
Vedic instructions are different because they do not have these four defects. Vedic instructions are not
subject to mistakes. The knowledge of the Vedas is knowledge received directly from God, and there is
consequently no question of illusion, cheating, mistakes or imperfect senses. All Vedic knowledge is
perfect because it is received directly from God by the parampara, disciplic succession. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.1.1) it is said: tene brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye. The original creature of this universe,
known as the adi-kavi, or Lord Brahma, was instructed by Krsna through the heart. After receiving these
Vedic instructions from Lord Krsna Himself, Brahma distributed the knowledge by the parampara system
to Narada, and Narada in turn distributed the knowledge to Vyasa. In this way Vedic knowledge is
perfect. If we act according to Vedic knowledge, there is no question of being involved in sinful activities.
