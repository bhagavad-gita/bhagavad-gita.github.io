<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Prthu underwent all these severe austerities in order to control his words and his senses, to
refrain from discharging his semen and to control the life air within his body. All this he did for the
satisfaction of Krsna. He had no other purpose.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Kali-yuga the following is recommended:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
(Brhan-naradiya Purana)
In order to be recognized by Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should chant the holy
name of the Lord continuously, twenty-four hours a day. Unfortunate persons who cannot accept this
formula prefer to execute some type of pseudomeditation, without accepting the other processes of
austerity. The fact is, however, that one must accept either the severe method of austerity described above
to become purified or take to the process of devotional service recommended for pleasing the Supreme
Lord, Krsna. The person who is Krsna conscious is most intelligent because in Kali-yuga it is not at all
possible to undergo such severe austerities. We need only follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. In His Siksastaka, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu wrote, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam:
all glories to the holy names of Lord Krsna, which from the very beginning purify the heart and
immediately liberate one. Bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam. If the real purpose of all yoga is to please
Lord Krsna, then this simple bhakti-yoga system recommended for this age is sufficient. It is necessary,
however, to engage constantly in the service of the Lord. Although Prthu Maharaja executed his
austerities long before the appearance of Lord Krsna on this planet, his purpose was still to please Krsna.
There are many fools who claim that worship of Krsna began only about five thousand years ago, after
the appearance of Lord Krsna in India, but this is not a fact. Prthu Maharaja worshiped Krsna millions of
years ago, for Prthu happened to be a descendant of the family of Maharaja Dhruva, who reigned for
thirty-six thousand years during the Satya-yuga age. Unless his total life-span was one hundred thousand
years, how could Dhruva Maharaja reign over the world for thirty-six thousand years? The point is that
Krsna worship existed at the beginning of creation and has continued to exist throughout Satya-yuga,
Treta-yuga and Dvapara-yuga, and now it is continuing in Kali-yuga. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, Krsna
appears not only in this millennium of Brahma's life, but in every millennium. Therefore worship of Krsna
is conducted in all millenniums. It is not that Krsna worship began only when Krsna appeared on this
planet five thousand years ago. This is a foolish conclusion that is not substantiated by Vedic literatures.
Also of significance in this verse are the words ariradhayisuh krsnam acarat tapa uttamam. Maharaja
Prthu underwent severe types of austerities for the express purpose of worshiping Krsna. Krsna is so kind,
especially in this age, that He appears in the transcendental vibration of His holy name. As is said in the
Narada-pancaratra, aradhito yadi haris tapasa tatah kim. If Krsna is worshiped, if He is the goal of
advancement, there is no need for one to execute severe types of tapasya, because one has already reached
his destination. If, after executing all types of tapasya, one cannot reach Krsna, all his tapasya has no
value, for without Krsna all austerity is simply wasted labor. Srama eva hi kevalam (Bhag. 1.2.8). We
should therefore not be discouraged just because we cannot go to the forest and practice severe
austerities. Our life is so short that we must strictly adhere to the principles laid down by the Vaisnava
acaryas and peacefully execute Krsna consciousness. There is no need to become despondent. Narottama
dasa Thakura recommends: anande bala hari, bhaja vrndavana, sri-guru-vaisnava-pade majaiya mana. For
a transcendental, blissful life, chant the Hare Krsna mantra, come worship the holy place of Vrndavana,
and always engage in the service of the Lord, of the spiritual master and of the Vaisnavas. This Krsna
consciousness movement is therefore very safe and easy. We have only to execute the order of the Lord
and fully surrender unto Him. We have only to execute the order of the spiritual master, preach Krsna
consciousness and follow in the path of the Vaisnavas. The spiritual master represents both Lord Krsna
and the Vaisnavas; therefore by following the instructions of the spiritual master and by chanting Hare
Krsna, everything will be all right.
