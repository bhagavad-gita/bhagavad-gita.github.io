<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya said: After the Personality of Godhead spoke thus, the Pracetas began to offer
Him prayers. The Lord is the bestower of all success in life and is the supreme benefactor. He is also the
supreme friend who takes away all miserable conditions experienced by a devotee. In a faltering voice,
due to ecstasy, the Pracetas began to offer prayers. They were purified by the presence of the Lord, who
was before them face to face.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is herein described as purusartha-bhajanam (the bestower of the ultimate goal of life).
Whatever success we want in life can be attained by the mercy of the Lord. Since the Pracetas had already
attained the Lord's mercy, they were no longer subject to the contamination of the material modes. The
material modes dissipated from them just as the darkness of night immediately dissipates when the sun
rises. Because the Lord appeared before them, naturally all the contaminations of the material qualities of
rajas and tamas completely disappeared. Similarly, when an unalloyed devotee chants the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra, he is also purified of all material contamination because the name of the Lord and the Lord
are identical. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):
srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah
hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani
vidhunoti suhrt satam
"Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the
benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee
who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard
and chanted."
The holy name of the Lord is the Lord Himself. If one chants and hears, he becomes purified. Gradually
all material contamination disappears. The Pracetas were already purified due to the Lord's presence
before them, and they could therefore offer the proper prayers with folded hands. In other words, as soon
as devotees are engaged in devotional service, they become transcendental to all material contamination
immediately, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). Sometimes
the devotees are dissatisfied due to their not seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally. When
the Pracetas saw the Supreme Lord personally present, their unhappiness vanished.
