<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, all living entities within this material world are mad after planning for things, and they
are always busy with a desire to do this or that. This is due to uncontrollable greed. The greed for material
enjoyment is always existing in the living entity, but Your Lordship is always alert, and in due course of
time You strike him, just as a snake seizes a mouse and very easily swallows him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Everyone is greedy, and everyone makes plans for material enjoyment. In his lust for material
enjoyment, the living entity is described as a madman. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27):
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to
be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature."
Everything is enacted by the laws of nature, and these laws are under the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The atheists, or unintelligent men, do not know this. They are busy making their
own plans, and big nations are busy expanding their empires. And yet we know that in due course of time
many empires have come into existence and been destroyed. Many aristocratic families were created by
people in their extreme madness, but we can see that in the course of time those families and empires
have all been destroyed. But still the foolish atheists do not accept the supreme authority of the Lord.
Such foolish people unnecessarily concoct their own duties without referring to the supreme authority of
the Lord. The so-called political leaders are busy making plans to advance the material prosperity of their
nation, but factually these political leaders only want an exalted position for themselves. Due to their
greed for material position, they falsely present themselves as leaders before the people and collect their
votes, although they are completely under the grip of the laws of material nature. These are some of the
faults of modern civilization. Without taking to God consciousness and accepting the authority of the
Lord, the living entities become ultimately confused and frustrated in their planmaking attempts. Due to
their unauthorized plans for economic development, the price of commodities is rising daily all over the
world, so much so that is has become difficult for the poorer classes, and they are suffering the
consequences. And due to lack of Krsna consciousness, people are being fooled by so-called leaders and
planmakers. Consequently, the sufferings of the people are increasing. According to the laws of nature,
which are backed by the Lord, nothing can be permanent within this material world; therefore everyone
should be allowed to take shelter of the Absolute in order to be saved. In this regard, Lord Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (5.29):
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all
planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs
of material miseries."
If one wants peace of mind and tranquillity in society, he must accept the fact that the real enjoyer is the
Supreme personality of Godhead. The Lord is the proprietor of everything all over the universe, and He is
the supreme friend of all living entities as well. By understanding this, people can become happy and
peaceful individually and collectively.
