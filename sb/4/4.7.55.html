mula--roots; phala-adibhih--by different kinds of vegetables and fruits; sasta--the newly grown grass;
ankura--buds; amsukaih--by the skin of trees, such as the bhurja; ca--and; arcet--should worship; tulasya--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One should worship the Lord by offering pure water, pure flower garlands, fruits, flowers and
vegetables, which are available in the forest, or by collecting newly grown grasses, small buds of flowers
or even the skins of trees, and if possible, by offering tulasi leaves, which are very dear to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is specifically mentioned herein that tulasi leaves are very dear to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and devotees should take particular care to have tulasi leaves in every temple and center of
worship. In the Western countries, while engaged in propagating the Krsna consciousness movement, we
were brought great unhappiness because we could not find tulasi leaves. We are very much obliged,
therefore, to our disciple Srimati Govinda dasi because she has taken much care to grow tulasi plants from
seeds, and she has been successful by the grace of Krsna. Now tulasi plants are growing in almost every
center of our movement.
Tulasi leaves are very important in the method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In
this verse the word salilaih means "by the water." Of course, Dhruva Maharaja was worshiping on the
bank of the Yamuna. The Yamuna and the Ganges are sacred, and sometimes devotees in India insist that
the Deity must be worshiped with water of the Ganges or Yamuna. But here we understand desa-kala to
mean "according to time and country." In the Western countries there is no River Yamuna or Ganges--
water from such sacred rivers is not available. Does this mean that the arca worship should for that reason
be stopped? No. Salilaih refers to any water--whatever is available--but it must be very clear and collected
purely. That water can be used. The other paraphernalia, such as flower garlands, fruits and vegetables,
should be collected according to the country and according to their availability. Tulasi leaves are very
important for satisfying the Lord, so as far as possible an arrangement should be made for growing tulasi
leaves. Dhruva Maharaja was advised to worship the Lord with the fruits and flowers available in the
forest. In the Bhagavad-gita Krsna frankly says that He accepts vegetables, fruits, flowers, etc. One should
not offer Lord Vasudeva anything other than what is prescribed herein by the great authority Narada
Muni. One cannot offer to the Deity according to one's whims; since these fruits and vegetables are
available anywhere in the universe, we should observe this small point very attentively.
