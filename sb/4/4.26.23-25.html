<h2>Translation</h2>
The followers of Yavanesvara [Yamaraja] are called the soldiers of death, and they are known as the
various types of disturbances that pertain to the body and mind. Prajvara represents the two types of
fever: extreme heat and extreme cold--typhoid and pneumonia. The living entity lying down within the
body is disturbed by many tribulations pertaining to providence, to other living entities and to his own
body and mind. Despite all kinds of tribulations, the living entity, subjected to the necessities of the body,
mind and senses and suffering from various types of disease, is carried away by many plans due to his lust
to enjoy the world. Although transcendental to this material existence, the living entity, out of ignorance,
accepts all these material miseries under the pretext of false egoism ("I" and "mine"). In this way he lives
for a hundred years within this body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Vedas it is stated: asango'yam purusah. The living entity is actually separate from material
existence, for the soul is not material. In Bhagavad-gita it is also said that the living entity is the superior
energy, and the material elements--earth, water, fire, air and so on--are the inferior energy. The material
elements are also described as bhinna, or separated energy. When the internal or superior energy comes in
contact with the external energy, it is subjected to so many tribulations. In Bhagavad-gita (2.14) the Lord
also says, matra-sparsas tu kaunteya sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah: because of the material body, the living
entity is subjected to many tribulations brought about by air, water, fire, extreme heat, extreme cold,
sunshine, excessive eating, unhealthy food, maladjustments of the three elements of the body (kapha,
pitta and vayu), and so on. The intestines, the throat, the brain and the other parts of the body are affected
by all kinds of diseases that are so powerful that they become sources of extreme suffering for the living
entity. The living entity, however, is different from all these material elements. The two types of fever
described in this verse can be explained in contemporary language as pneumonia and typhoid. When
there is an extreme fever in the body, there is typhoid and pneumonia, and they are described as Prajvara.
There are also other miseries created by other living entities. The state exacts taxes, and there are also
many thieves, rogues and cheaters. Miseries brought about by other living entities are called adhibhautika.
There are also miseries in the form of famine, pestilence, scarcity, war, earthquakes and so on. These are
caused by the demigods or other sources beyond our control. Actually there are many enemies of the
living entities, and these are all described to point out how miserable this material existence is.
Knowing the basic misery of material existence, one should be induced to get out of the material
clutches and return home, back to Godhead. Actually the living entity is not at all happy in this material
body. Because of the body, he suffers thirst and hunger and is influenced by the mind, by words, by anger,
by the belly, by the genitals, by the rectum, and so on. Manifold miseries encircle the transcendental
living entity simply because he desires to satisfy his senses in this material world. If he simply withdraws
from activities of sense gratification and applies his senses in the service of the Lord, all the problems of
material existence will immediately diminish, and with the advancement of Krsna consciousness, he will
be freed from all tribulation and, after giving up the body, will return home, back to Godhead.
