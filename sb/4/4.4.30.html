<h2>Text</h2>
so 'yam durmarsa-hrdayo brahma-dhruk ca
loke 'pakirtim mahatim avapsyati
yad-angajam svam purusa-dvid udyatam
na pratyasedhan mrtaye 'paradhatah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; ayam--that; durmarsa-hrdayah--hardhearted; brahma-dhruk--unworthy to be a brahmana; ca--
and; loke--in the world; apakirtim--ill fame; mahatim--extensive; avapsyati--will gain; yat-anga-jam--the
daughter of whom; svam--own; purusa-dvit--the enemy of Lord Siva; udyatam--who was preparing; na
pratyasedhat--did not prevent; mrtaye--for death; aparadhatah--because of his offenses.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Daksa, who is so hardhearted that he is unworthy to be a brahmana, will gain extensive ill fame because
of his offenses to his daughter, because of not having prevented her death, and because of his great envy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Daksa is described here as most hardhearted and therefore unqualified to be a brahmana. Brahma-dhruk
is described by some commentators to mean brahma-bandhu, or friend of the brahmanas. A person who is
born in a brahmana family but has no brahminical qualifications is called a brahma-bandhu. Brahmanas
are generally very softhearted and forbearing because they have the power to control the senses and the
mind. Daksa, however, was not forbearing. For the simple reason that his son-in-law, Lord Siva, did not
stand up to show him the formality of respect, he became so angry and hardhearted that he tolerated even
the death of his dearest daughter. Sati tried her best to mitigate the misunderstanding between the son-inlaw
and the father-in-law by coming to her father's house, even without an invitation, and at that time
Daksa should have received her, forgetting all past misunderstandings. But he was so hardhearted that he
was unworthy to be called an Aryan or brahmana. Thus his ill fame still continues. Daksa means "expert,"
and he was given this name because of his ability to beget many hundreds and thousands of children.
Persons who are too sexually inclined and materialistic become so hardhearted because of a slight loss of
prestige that they can tolerate even the death of their children.
