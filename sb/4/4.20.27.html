<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Now I wish to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to serve
just like the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand, because His Lordship, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. I am afraid that the
goddess of fortune and I would quarrel because both of us would be attentively engaged in the same
service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is here addressed as akhila-purusottama, the Supreme personality of Godhead, Lord of the
entire creation. purusa means "the enjoyer," and uttama means "the best." There are different kinds of
purusas, or enjoyers, within the universe. Generally they can be divided into three classes--those who are
conditioned, those who are liberated and those who are eternal. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is called
the supreme eternal of all eternals (nityo nityanam). Both the Supreme personality of Godhead and the
living entities are eternal. The supreme eternals are the visnu-tattva, or Lord Visnu and His expansions. So
nitya refers to the Personality of Godhead, beginning from Krsna to Maha-Visnu, Narayana and other
expansions of Lord Krsna. As stated in the Brahma-samhita (ramadi-murtisu), there are millions and
trillions of expansions of Lord Visnu, as Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha and other incarnations. All of them are
called eternals.
The word mukta refers to the living entities who never come within this material world. The baddhas
are those living entities who are almost eternally living within this material world. The baddhas are
struggling very hard within this material world to become free from the threefold miseries of material
nature and to enjoy life, whereas the muktas are already liberated. They never come into this material
world. Lord Visnu is the master of this material world, and there is no question of His being controlled by
material nature. Consequently, Lord Visnu is addressed here as purusottama, the best of all living
entities--namely visnu-tattvas and jiva-tattvas. It is a great offense, therefore, to compare Lord Visnu and
the jiva-tattva or consider them on an equal level. The Mayavadi philosophers equalize the jivas and the
Supreme Lord and consider them to be one, but that is the greatest offense to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu.
Here in the material world we have practical experience that a superior person is worshiped by an
inferior one. Similarly, purusottama, the greatest, the Supreme personality of Godhead, Krsna, or Lord
Visnu, is always worshiped by others. Prthu Maharaja therefore decided to engage in the service of the
lotus feet of Lord Visnu. Prthu Maharaja is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Visnu, but he is called
a saktyavesa incarnation. Another significant word in this verse is gunalayam, which refers to Visnu as the
reservoir of all transcendental qualities. The Mayavadi philosophers take the Absolute Truth to be nirguna
("without qualities"), in accordance with the impersonalistic view, but actually the Lord is the reservoir of
all good qualities. One of the most important qualities of the Lord is His inclination to His devotees, for
which He is called bhakta-vatsala. The devotees are always very much inclined to render service unto the
lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord is also very much inclined to accept loving service from His devotees.
In that exchange of service there are many transcendental transactions, which are called transcendental
qualitative activities. Some of the transcendental qualities of the Lord are that He is omniscient,
omnipresent, all-pervasive, all-powerful, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, the reservoir of all
pleasures, the reservoir of all knowledge, the all-auspicious and so on.
Prthu Maharaja desired to serve the Lord with the goddess of fortune, but this desire does not mean that
he was situated on the platform of madhurya-rasa. The goddess of fortune is engaged in the service of the
Lord in the rasa of madhurya, conjugal love. Although her position is on the chest of the Lord, the
goddess of fortune, in her position as a devotee, takes pleasure in serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Prthu
Maharaja was thinking only of the lotus feet of the Lord because he is on the platform of dasya-rasa, or
servitorship of the Lord. From the next verse we learn that Prthu Maharaja was thinking of the goddess of
fortune as the universal mother, jagan-mata. Consequently there was no question of his competing with
her on the platform of madhurya-rasa. Nonetheless he feared that she might take offense at his engaging
in the service of the Lord. This suggests that in the absolute world there is sometimes competition
between servitors in the service of the Lord, but such competition is without malice. In the Vaikuntha
worlds if a devotee excels in the service of the Lord, others do not become envious of his excellent service
but rather aspire to come to the platform of that service.
