<h2>Text</h2>
aham mameti svikrtya
grhesu kumatir grhi
dadhyau pramadaya dino
viprayoga upasthite
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aham--I; mama--mine; iti--thus; svi-krtya--accepting; grhesu--in the home; ku-matih--whose mind is full
of obnoxious thoughts; grhi--the householder; dadhyau--turns his attention to; pramadaya--with his wife;
dinah--very poor; viprayoge--when separation; upasthite--occurred.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana was overly attached to his family and conceptions of "I" and "mine." Because he was
overly attracted to his wife, he was already quite poverty-stricken. At the time of separation, he became
very sorry.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is clear in this verse that at the time of death thoughts of material enjoyment do not go away. This
indicates that the living entity, the soul, is carried by the subtle body--mind, intelligence and ego. Due to
false ego, the living entity still wants to enjoy the material world, and for want of material enjoyment he
becomes sorry or sad. He still makes intellectual plans to further his existence, and therefore, although he
gives up the gross body, he is carried by the subtle body to another gross body. The transmigration of the
subtle body is never visible to material eyes; therefore when one gives up the gross body, we think that he
is finished. Plans for material enjoyment are made by the subtle body, and the gross body is the
instrument for enjoying these plans. Thus the gross body can be compared to the wife, for the wife is the
agent for all kinds of sense gratification. Because of long association with the gross body, the living entity
becomes very sad to be separated from it. The mental activity of the living entity obliges him to accept
another gross body and continue his material existence.
The Sanskrit word stri means "expansion." Through the wife one expands his various objects of
attraction--sons, daughters, grandsons and so on. Attachment to family members becomes very prominent
at the time of death. One often sees that just before leaving his body a man may call for his beloved son to
give him charge of his wife and other paraphernalia. He may say, "My dear boy, I am being forced to
leave. Please take charge of the family affairs." He speaks in this way, not even knowing his destination.
