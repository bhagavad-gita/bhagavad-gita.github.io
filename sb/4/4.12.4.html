TRANSLATION
Misidentification of oneself and others as "I" and "you" on the basis of the bodily concept of life is a
product of ignorance. This bodily concept is the cause of repeated birth and death, and it makes us go on
continuously in material existence.
PURPORT
The conception of "I" and "you," aham tvam, as separate from each other, is due to our forgetfulness of
our eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Person, Krsna, is the
central point, and all of us are His parts and parcels, just as hands and legs are parts and parcels of the
whole body. When we actually come to this understanding of being eternally related to the Supreme Lord,
this distinction, which is based on the bodily concept of life, cannot exist. The same example can be cited
herewith: the hand is the hand, and the leg is the leg, but when both of them engage in the service of the
whole body, there is no such distinction as "hands" and "legs," for all of them belong to the whole body,
and all the parts working together constitute the whole body. Similarly, when the living entities are in
Krsna consciousness, there is no such distinction as "I" and "you" because everyone is engaged in the
service of the Lord. Since the Lord is absolute, the services are also absolute; even though the hand is
working one way and the leg is working in another way, since the purpose is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, they are all one. This is not to be confused with the statement by the Mayavadi philosopher that
"everything is one." Real knowledge is that hand is hand, leg is leg, body is body, and yet all together they
are one. As soon as the living entity thinks that he is independent, his conditional, material existence
begins. The conception of independent existence is therefore like a dream. One has to be in Krsna
consciousness, his original position. Then he can be freed from material bondage.
