<h2>Translation</h2>
While all the Pracetas were executing religious rituals and sacrificial ceremonies and thus worshiping
the Supreme Personality of Godhead for His satisfaction, the great sage Narada described the
transcendental qualities of Dhruva Maharaja.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narada Muni is always glorifying the pastimes of the Lord. In this verse we see that not only does he
glorify the Lord, but he also likes to glorify the devotees of the Lord. The great sage Narada's mission is to
broadcast the devotional service of the Lord. For this purpose he has compiled the Narada-pancaratra, a
directory of devotional service, so that devotees can always take information about how to execute
devotional service and thus engage twenty-four hours a day in performing sacrifices for the pleasure of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord has created four orders of social
life, namely brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. In the Narada-pancaratra it is very clearly described
how each of the social orders can please the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita (18.45) it is stated, sve
sve karmany abhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah: by executing one's prescribed duties one can please the
Supreme Lord. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13) also it is stated, svanusthitasya dharmasya samsiddhir
hari-tosanam: the perfection of duty is to see that by discharging one's specific duties one satisfies the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Pracetas were performing sacrifices according to this
direction, Narada Muni was satisfied to see these activities, and he also wanted to glorify Dhruva Maharaja
in that sacrificial arena.
