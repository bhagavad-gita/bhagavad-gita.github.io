tato 'py asid bhayam tv adya

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
arajaka--being without a king; bhayat--out of fear; esah--this Vena; krtah--was made; raja--the king; atat-
arhanah--though not qualified for it; tatah--from him; api--also; asit--there was; bhayam--danger; tu--
then; adya--now; katham--how; syat--can there be; svasti--happiness; dehinam--of the people in general.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thinking to save the state from irregularity, the sages began to consider that it was due to a political
crisis that they made Vena king although he was not qualified. But alas, now the people were being
disturbed by the king himself. Under such circumstances, how could the people be happy?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (18.5) it is stated that even in the renounced order one should not give up sacrifice,
charity and penance. The brahmacaris must perform sacrifices, the grhasthas must give in charity, and
those in the renounced order of life (the vanaprasthas and sannyasis) must practice penance and
austerities. These are the procedures by which everyone can be elevated to the spiritual platform. When
the sages and saintly persons saw that King Vena had stopped all these functions, they became concerned
about the people's progress. Saintly people preach God consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, because
they are anxious to save the general populace from the dangers of animalistic life. There must be a good
government to see that the citizens are actually executing their religious rituals, and thieves and rogues
must be curbed. When this is done, the people can advance peacefully in spiritual consciousness and
make their lives successful.
