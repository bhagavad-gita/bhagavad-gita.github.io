<h2>Text</h2>
sa ca svarlokam aroksyan
sunitim jananim dhruvah
anvasmarad agam hitva
dinam yasye tri-vistapam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; ca--also; svah-lokam--to the celestial planet; aroksyan--about to ascend; sunitim--Suniti;
jananim--mother; dhruvah--Dhruva Maharaja; anvasmarat--immediately remembered; agam--difficult to
attain; hitva--leaving behind; dinam--poor; yasye--I shall go; tri-vistapam--to the Vaikuntha planet.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva was seated in the transcendental airplane, which was just about to start, when he remembered
his poor mother, Suniti. He thought to himself, "How shall I go alone to the Vaikuntha planet and leave
behind my poor mother?"
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva had a feeling of obligation to his mother, Suniti. It was Suniti who had given him the clue which
had now enabled him to be personally carried to the Vaikuntha planet by the associates of Lord Visnu. He
now remembered her and wanted to take her with him. Actually, Dhruva Maharaja's mother, Suniti, was
his patha-pradarsaka-guru. Patha-pradarsaka-guru means "the guru, or the spiritual master, who shows
the way." Such a guru is sometimes called siksa-guru. Although Narada Muni was his diksa-guru
(initiating spiritual master), Suniti, his mother, was the first who gave him instruction on how to achieve
the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the duty of the siksa-guru or diksa-guru to instruct
the disciple in the right way, and it depends on the disciple to execute the process. According to sastric
injunctions, there is no difference between siksa-guru and diksa-guru, and generally the siksa-guru later
on becomes the diksa-guru. Suniti, however, being a woman, and specifically his mother, could not
become Dhruva Maharaja's diksa-guru. Still, he was not less obliged to Suniti. There was no question of
carrying Narada Muni to Vaikunthaloka, but Dhruva Maharaja thought of his mother.
Whatever plan the Supreme Personality of Godhead contemplates immediately fructifies. Similarly, a
devotee who is completely dependent on the Supreme Lord can also fulfill his wishes by the grace of the
Lord. The Lord fulfills His wishes independently, but a devotee fulfills his wishes simply by being
dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore as soon as Dhruva Maharaja thought of his
poor mother, he was assured by the associates of Visnu that Suniti was also going to Vaikunthaloka, in
another plane. Dhruva Maharaja had thought that he was going alone to Vaikunthaloka, leaving behind
his mother, which was not very auspicious because people would criticize him for going alone to
Vaikunthaloka and not carrying with him Suniti, who had given him so much. But Dhruva also
considered that he was not personally the Supreme. Therefore, if Krsna fulfilled his desires, only then
would it be possible. Krsna could immediately understand his mind, and He told Dhruva that his mother
was also going with him. This incident proves that a pure devotee like Dhruva Maharaja can fulfill all his
desires; by the grace of the Lord, he becomes exactly like the Lord, and thus whenever he thinks of
anything, his wish is immediately fulfilled.
