<h2>Text</h2>
sarve sva-mukhya-vatsena
sve sve patre prthak payah
sarva-kama-dugham prthvim
duduhuh prthu-bhavitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarve--all; sva-mukhya--by their own chiefs; vatsena--as the calf; sve sve--in their own; patre--pots;
prthak--different; payah--milk; sarva-kama--all desirables; dugham--supplying as milk; prthvim--the
planet earth; duduhuh--milked out; prthu-bhavitam--controlled by King Prthu.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The planet earth supplied everyone his respective food. During the time of King Prthu, the earth was
fully under the control of the King. Thus all the inhabitants of the earth could get their food supply by
creating various types of calves and putting their particular types of milk in various pots.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is evidence that the Lord supplies food to everyone. As confirmed in the Vedas: eko bahunam yo
vidadhati kaman. Although the Lord is one, He is supplying all necessities to everyone through the
medium of the planet earth. There are different varieties of living entities on different planets, and they all
derive their eatables from their planets in different forms. On the basis of these descriptions, how can one
assume that there is no living entity on the moon? Every moon is earthly, being composed of the five
elements. Every planet produces different types of food according to the needs of its residents. According
to the Vedic sastras, it is not true that the moon does not produce food or that no living entity is living
there.
