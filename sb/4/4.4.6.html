<h2>Translation</h2>
She then reached her father's house, where the sacrifice was being performed, and entered the arena
where everyone was chanting the Vedic hymns. The great sages, brahmanas and demigods were all
assembled there, and there were many sacrificial animals, as well as pots made of clay, stone, gold, grass
and skin, which were all requisite for the sacrifice.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When learned sages and brahmanas assemble to chant Vedic mantras, some of them also engage in
arguing about the conclusion of the scriptures. Thus some of the sages and brahmanas were arguing, and
some of them were chanting the Vedic mantras, so the entire atmosphere was surcharged with
transcendental sound vibration. This transcendental sound vibration has been simplified in the
transcendental vibration Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare. In this age, no one is expected to be highly educated in the Vedic ways of
understanding because people are very slow, lazy and unfortunate. Therefore Lord Caitanya has
recommended the sound vibration Hare Krsna, and in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32) it is also
recommended: yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah. At the present moment it is impossible
to gather sacrificial necessities because of the poverty of the population and their lack of knowledge in
Vedic mantras. Therefore for this age it is recommended that people gather together and chant the Hare
Krsna mantra to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is accompanied by His associates.
Indirectly this indicates Lord Caitanya, who is accompanied by His associates Nityananda, Advaita and
others. That is the process of performing yajna in this age.
Another significant point in this verse is that there were animals for sacrifice. That these animals were
meant for sacrifice does not mean that they were meant to be killed. The great sages and realized souls
assembled were performing yajnas, and their realization was tested by animal sacrifice, just as, in modern
science, tests are made on animals to determine the effectiveness of a particular medicine. The brahmanas
entrusted with the performance of yajna were very realized souls, and to test their realization an old
animal was offered in the fire and rejuvenated. That was the test of a Vedic mantra. The animals gathered
were not meant to be killed and eaten. The real purpose of a sacrifice was not to replace a slaughterhouse
but to test a Vedic mantra by giving an animal new life. Animals were used to test the power of Vedic
mantras, not for meat.
