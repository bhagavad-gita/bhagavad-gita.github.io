TRANSLATION
My dear girl, your face is so beautiful with your nice eyebrows and eyes and with your bluish hair
scattered about. In addition, very sweet sounds are coming from your mouth. Nonetheless, you are so
covered with shyness that you do not see me face to face. I therefore request you, my dear girl, to smile
and kindly raise your head to see me.
PURPORT
Such a speech is typical of a living entity attracted by the opposite sex. This is called bewilderment
occasioned by becoming conditioned by material nature. When thus attracted by the beauty of the
material energy, one becomes very eager to enjoy. This is elaborately described in this instance of
Puranjana's becoming attracted by the beautiful woman. In conditional life the living entity is attracted by
a face, eyebrows or eyes, a voice or anything. In short, everything becomes attractive. When a man or a
woman is attracted by the opposite sex, it does not matter whether the opposite sex is beautiful or not.
The lover sees everything beautiful in the face of the beloved and thus becomes attracted. This attraction
causes the living entity to fall down in this material world. This is described in Bhagavad-gita (7.27):
iccha-dvesa-samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhutani sammoham
sarge yanti parantapa
"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome
by the dualities of desire and hate."
This condition of life is called avidya. Opposed to this avidya is real knowledge. Sri Isopanisad
distinguishes between vidya and avidya, knowledge and ignorance. By avidya (ignorance) one becomes
conditioned, and by vidya (knowledge) one becomes liberated. Puranjana admits herein that he is
attracted by avidya. Now he wishes to see the complete feature of avidya and so requests the girl to raise
her head so that he can see her face to face. He thus wishes to see the various features that make avidya
attractive.
