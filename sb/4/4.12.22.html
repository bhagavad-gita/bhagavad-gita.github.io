<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja was always absorbed in thinking of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. His heart was full
with Krsna. When the two confidential servants of the Supreme Lord, who were named Nanda and
Sunanda, approached him, smiling happily, Dhruva stood with folded hands, bowing humbly. They then
addressed him as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word puskaranabha-sammatau is significant. Krsna, or Lord Visnu, is known for His
lotus eyes, lotus navel, lotus feet and lotus palms. Here He is called puskara-nabha, which means "the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a lotus navel," and sammatau means "two confidential or very
obedient servants." The materialistic way of life differs from the spiritual way of life in that one is
disobedience and the other is obedience to the will of the Supreme Lord. All living entities are part and
parcel of the Supreme Lord, and they are supposed to be always agreeable to the order of the Supreme
person; that is perfect oneness.
In the Vaikuntha world all the living entities are in oneness with the Supreme Godhead because they
never defy His orders. Here in the material world, however, they are not sammata, agreeable, but always
asammata, disagreeable. This human form of life is a chance to be trained to be agreeable to the orders of
the Supreme Lord. To bring about this training in society is the mission of the Krsna consciousness
movement. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, the laws of material nature are very strict; no one can
overcome the stringent laws of material nature. But one who becomes a surrendered soul and agrees to
the order of the Supreme Lord can easily overcome those stringent laws. The example of Dhruva Maharaja
is very fitting. Simply by becoming agreeable to the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and by
developing love of Godhead, Dhruva got the chance to personally meet the confidential servants of Lord
Visnu face to face. What was possible for Dhruva Maharaja is possible for everyone. Anyone who very
seriously engages in devotional service can obtain, in due course of time, the same perfection of the
human form of life.
