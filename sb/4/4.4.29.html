<h2>Text</h2>
aho anatmyam mahad asya pasyata
prajapater yasya caracaram prajah
jahav asun yad-vimatatmaja sati
manasvini manam abhiksnam arhati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--oh; anatmyam--neglect; mahat--great; asya--of Daksa; pasyata--just see; prajapateh--of the
Prajapati; yasya--of whom; cara-acaram--all living entities; prajah--offspring; jahau--gave up; asun--her
body; yat--by whom; vimata--disrespected; atma-ja--his own daughter; sati--Sati; manasvini--voluntarily;
manam--respect; abhiksnam--repeatedly; arhati--deserved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It was astonishing that Daksa, who was Prajapati, the maintainer of all living entities, was so
disrespectful to his own daughter, Sati, who was not only chaste but was also a great soul, that she gave
up her body because of his neglect.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word anatmya is significant. Atmya means "the life of the soul," so this word indicates that
although Daksa appeared to be living, actually he was a dead body, otherwise how could he neglect Sati,
who was his own daughter? It was the duty of Daksa to look after the maintenance and comforts of all
living entities because he was situated as Prajapati, the governor of all living entities. Therefore how is it
that he neglected his own daughter, who was the most exalted and chaste woman, a great soul, and who
therefore deserved the most respectful treatment from her father? The death of Sati because of her being
neglected by Daksa, her father, was most astonishing to all the great demigods of the universe.
