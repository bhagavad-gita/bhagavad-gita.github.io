<h2>Translation</h2>
The four great sages were elder to Lord Siva, and when they were seated on the golden throne, they
appeared just like fire blazing on an altar. Maharaja Prthu, out of his great gentleness and respect for
them, began to speak with great restraint as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Kumaras are described herein as the elder brothers of Lord Siva. When the Kumaras were born out
of the body of Lord Brahma, they were requested to get married and increase the population. In the
beginning of the creation there was a great need of population; therefore Lord Brahma was creating one
son after another and ordering them to increase. However, when the Kumaras were requested to do so,
they declined. They wanted to remain brahmacari throughout life and be engaged fully in the devotional
service of the Lord. The Kumaras are called naisthika-brahmacari, meaning they are never to marry.
Because of their refusal to marry, Lord Brahma became so angry that his eyes became reddish. From
between his eyes, Lord Siva, or Rudra, appeared. The mode of anger is consequently known as rudra. Lord
Siva also has a sampradaya party, known as the Rudra-sampradaya, and they are also known as Vaisnavas.
