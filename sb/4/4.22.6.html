<h2>Text</h2>
rajnam vrttim karadanadanda-
sulkadi-darunam
manyamano dirgha-sattravyajena
visasarja ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajnam--of the kings; vrttim--source of livelihood; kara--taxes; adana--realization; danda--punishment;
sulka--fines; adi--etc.; darunam--which are very severe; manyamanah--thinking like that; dirgha--long;
sattra--sacrifice; vyajena--on the plea; visasarja--gave up; ha--in the past.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Whenever Antardhana, the supreme royal power, had to exact taxes, punish his citizens or fine them
severely, he was not willing to do so. Consequently he retired from the execution of such duties and
engaged himself in the performance of different sacrifices.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is clear herein that the king sometimes has to perform duties which are not very desirable just because
he is the king. Similarly, Arjuna was not at all willing to fight because fighting or killing one's own
kinsmen and family members is not at all desirable. Nonetheless the ksatriyas had to perform such
undesirable actions as a matter of duty. Maharaja Antardhana was not very happy while exacting taxes or
punishing the citizens for their criminal activities; therefore, on the plea of performing sacrifices, he
retired from the royal majestic power at a very early age.
