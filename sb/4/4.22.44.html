darsanam no didrksunam
dehi bhagavatarcitam
rupam priyatamam svanam
sarvendriya-gunanjanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
darsanam--vision; nah--our; didrksunam--desirous to see; dehi--kindly exhibit; bhagavata--of the
devotees; arcitam--as worshiped by them; rupam--form; priya-tamam--dearmost; svanam--of Your
devotees; sarva-indriya--all the senses; guna--qualities; anjanam--very much pleasing.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, I wish to see You exactly in the form that Your very dear devotees worship. You have
many other forms, but I wish to see Your form that is especially liked by the devotees. Please be merciful
upon me and show me that form, for only that form worshiped by the devotees can perfectly satisfy all the
demands of the senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the sruti, or veda-mantra, it is said that the Supreme Absolute Truth is sarva-kamah sarva-gandhah
sarva-rasah, or, in other words, He is known as raso vai sah, the source of all relishable relationships
(rasas). We have various senses--the powers of seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, etc.--and all the
propensities of our senses can be satisfied when the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord.
Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate: "Bhakti means engaging all the senses in the service of the
master of the senses, Hrsikesa." (Narada-pancaratra) These material senses, however, cannot be engaged
in the service of the Lord; therefore one has to become free from all designations. Sarvopadhivinirmuktam
tatparatvena nirmalam. One has to become free from all designation or false egotism and
thus become purified. come free from all designation or false egotism and thus become purified. When we
engage our senses in the service of the Lord, the desires or the inclinations of the senses can be perfectly
fulfilled. Lord Siva therefore wants to see the Lord in a form which is inconceivable to the Bauddha
philosophers, or the Buddhists.
The impersonalists and the voidists also have to see the form of the Absolute. In Buddhist temples there
are forms of Lord Buddha in meditation, but these are not worshiped like the forms of the Lord in
Vaisnava temples (forms like Radha-Krsna, Sita-Rama or Laksmi-Narayana). Amongst the different
sampradayas (Vaisnava sects) either Radha-Krsna or Laksmi-Narayana is worshiped. Lord Siva wants to
see that form perfectly, just as the devotees want to see it. I he words rupam priyatamam svanam are
specifically mentioned here, indicating that Lord Siva wants to see that form which is very dear to the
devotees. The word svanam is especially significant because only the devotees are very, very dear to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The jnanis, yogis and karmis are not particularly dear, for the karmis
simply want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their order supplier. The jnanis want to see
Him to become one with Him, and the yogis want to see Him partially represented within their heart as
Paramatma, but the bhaktas, or the devotees, want to see Him in His complete perfection. As stated in
Brahma-samhita (5.30):
venum kvanantam aravinda-dalayataksam
barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam
kandarpa-koti-kamaniya-visesa-sobham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept at playing on His flute, whose eyes are blooming
like lotus petals, whose head is bedecked with peacock feathers, whose beauty is tinged with the hue of
blue clouds, and whose unique loveliness charms millions of Cupids." Thus Lord Siva's desire is to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in this way--that is, he wants to see Him as He appears
to the bhagavatas, the devotees. The conclusion is that Lord Siva wants to see Him in complete perfection
and not in the impersonalist or voidist way. Although the Lord is one in His various forms (advaitam
acyutam anadim), still His form as the young enjoyer of the gopis and companion of the cowherd boys
(kisora-murti) is the most perfect form. Thus Vaisnavas accept the form of the Lord in His Vrndavana
pastimes as the chief form.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily
features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely
beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a
beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After the scorching heat of the summer season, it is very pleasing to see dark clouds in the sky. As
confirmed in Brahma-samhita: barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam. The Lord wears a peacock
feather in His hair, and His bodily complexion is just like a blackish cloud. The word sundara, or snigdha,
means "very pleasing." Kandarpa-koti-kamaniya. Krsna's beauty is so pleasing that not even millions upon
millions of Cupids can compare to it. The Lord's form as Visnu is decorated in all opulence; therefore
Lord Siva is trying to see that most opulent form of Narayana, or Visnu. Generally the worship of the Lord
begins with the worship of Narayana, or Visnu, whereas the worship of Lord Krsna and Radha is most
confidential. Lord Narayana is worshipable by the pancaratrika-vidhi, or regulative principles, whereas
Lord Krsna is worshipable by the bhagavata-vidhi. No one can worship the Lord in the bhagavata-vidhi
without going through the regulations of the pancaratrika-vidhi. Actually, neophyte devotees worship the
Lord according to the pancaratrika-vidhi, or the regulative principles enjoined in the Narada-pancaratra.
Radha-Krsna cannot be approached by the neophyte devotees; therefore temple worship according to
regulative principles is offered to Laksmi-Narayana. Although there may be a Radha-Krsna vigraha, or
form, the worship of the neophyte devotees is acceptable as Laksmi-Narayana worship. Worship
according to the pancaratrika-vidhi is called vidhi-marga, and worship according to the bhagavata-vidhi
principles is called raga-marga. The principles of raga-marga are especially meant for devotees who are
elevated to the Vrndavana platform.
The inhabitants of Vrndavana--the gopis, mother Yasoda, Nanda Maharaja, the cowherd boys, the cows
and everyone else--are actually on the raga-marga or bhagavata-marga platform. They participate in five
basic rasas--dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, madhurya and santa. But although these five rasas are found in the
bhagavata-marga, the bhagavata-marga is especially meant for vatsalya and madhurya, or paternal and
conjugal relationships. Yet there is the vipralambha-sakhya, the higher fraternal worship of the Lord
especially enjoyed by the cowherd boys. Although there is friendship between Krsna and the cowherd
boys, this friendship is different from the aisvarya friendship between Krsna and Arjuna. When Arjuna
saw the visva-rupa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord, he was afraid for having treated Krsna as an
ordinary friend; therefore he begged Krsna's pardon. However, the cowherd boys who are friends of Krsna
in Vrndavana sometimes ride on the shoulders of Krsna. They treat Krsna equally, just as they treat one
another, and they are never afraid of Him, nor do they ever beg His pardon. Thus the raga-marga, or
bhagavata-marga, friendship exists on a higher platform with Krsna, namely the platform of vipralambha
friendship. Paternal friendship, paternal service and conjugal service are visible in the Vrndavana ragamarga
relationships.
Without serving Krsna according to the vidhi-marga regulative principles of the pancaratrika-vidhi,
unscrupulous persons want to jump immediately to the raga-marga principles. Such persons are called
sahajiya. There are also demons who enjoy depicting Krsna and His pastimes with the gopis, taking
advantage of Krsna by their licentious character. These demons who print books and write lyrics on the
raga-marga principles are surely on the way to hell. Unfortunately, they lead others down with them.
Devotees in Krsna consciousness should be very careful to avoid such demons. One should strictly follow
the vidhi-marga regulative principles in the worship of Laksmi-Narayana, although the Lord is present in
the temple as Radha-Krsna. Radha-Krsna includes Laksmi-Narayana; therefore when one worships the
Lord according to the regulative principles, the Lord accepts the service in the role of Laksmi-Narayana.
In The Nectar of Devotion full instructions are given about the vidhi-marga worship of Radha-Krsna, or
Laksmi-Narayana. Although there are sixty-four kinds of offenses one can commit in vidhi-marga
worship, in raga-marga worship there is no consideration of such offenses because the devotees on that
platform are very much elevated, and there is no question of offense. But if we do not follow the regulative
principles on the vidhi-marga platform and keep our eyes trained to spot offenses, we will not make
progress.
In his description of Krsna's beauty, Lord Siva uses the words carvayata-catur-bahu sujata-rucirananam,
indicating the beautiful four-armed form of Narayana, or Visnu. Those who worship Lord Krsna describe
Him as sujata-rucirananam. In the visnu-tattva there are hundreds and thousands and millions of forms of
the Supreme Lord, but of all these forms, the form of Krsna is the most beautiful. Thus for those who
worship Krsna, the word sujata-rucirananam is used.
The four arms of Lord Visnu have different purposes. The hands holding a lotus flower and conchshell
are meant for the devotees, whereas the other two hands, holding a disc and mace, or club, are meant for
the demons. Actually all of the Lord's arms are auspicious, whether they are holding conchshells and
flowers or clubs and discs. The demons killed by Lord Visnu's cakra disc and club are elevated to the
spiritual world, just like the devotees who are protected by the hands holding the lotus flower and
conchshell. However, the demons who are elevated to the spiritual world are situated in the impersonal
Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are allowed to enter into the Vaikuntha planets. Those who are
devotees of Lord Krsna are immediately elevated to the Goloka Vrndavana planet.
The Lord's beauty is compared to rainfall because when the rain falls in the rainy season, it becomes
more and more pleasing to the people. After the scorching heat of the summer season, the people enjoy
the rainy season very much. Indeed, they even come out of their doors in the villages and enjoy the
rainfall directly. Thus the Lord's bodily features are compared to the clouds of the rainy season. The
devotees enjoy the Lord's beauty because it is a collection of all kinds of beauties. Therefore the word
sarva-saundarya-sangraham is used. No one can say that the body of the Lord is wanting in beautiful
parts. It is completely purnam. Everything is complete: God's creation, God's beauty and God's bodily
features. All these are so complete that all one's desires can become fully satisfied when one sees the
beauty of the Lord. The word sarva-saundarya indicates that there are different types of beauties in the
material and spiritual worlds and that the Lord contains all of them. Both materialists and spiritualists can
enjoy the beauty of the Lord. Because the Supreme Lord attracts everyone, including demons and
devotees, materialists and spiritualists, He is called Krsna. Similarly, His devotees also attract everyone. As
mentioned in the Sad-gosvami-stotra: dhiradhira-jana-priyau--the Gosvamis are equally dear to the dhira
(devotees) and adhira (demons). Lord Krsna was not very pleasing to the demons when He was present in
Vrndavana, but the six Gosvamis were pleasing to the demons when they were present in Vrndavana.
That is the beauty of the Lord's dealings with His devotees; sometimes the Lord gives more credit to His
devotees than He takes for Himself. For instance, on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Lord Krsna fought
simply by giving directions. Yet it was Arjuna who took the credit for fighting. Nimitta-matram bhava
savyasacin: "You, O Savyasaci [Arjuna], can be but an instrument in the fight." (Bg. 11.33) Everything
was arranged by the Lord, but the credit of victory was given to Arjuna. Similarly, in the Krsna
consciousness movement, everything is happening according to the predictions of Lord Caitanya, but the
credit goes to Lord Caitanya's sincere servants. Thus the Lord is described herein as sarva-saundaryasangraham.

<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord is superexcellently beautiful on account of His open and merciful smile and Mis sidelong
glance upon His devotees. His black hair is curly, and His garments, waving in the wind, appear like flying
saffron pollen from lotus flowers. His glittering earrings, shining helmet, bangles, garland, ankle bells,
waist belt and various other bodily ornaments combine with conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower to
increase the natural beauty of the Kaustubha pearl on His chest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word prahasitapanga, referring to Krsna's smile and sidelong glances at His devotees, specifically
applies to His dealings with the gopis. Krsna is always in a joking mood when He increases the feelings of
conjugal rasa in the hearts of the gopis. The conchshell, club, disc and lotus flower can be either held in
His hands or seen on the palms of His hands. According to palmistry, the signs of a conchshell, club, lotus
flower and disc mark the palms of great personalities and especially indicate the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
