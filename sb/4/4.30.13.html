<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kandoh--of the sage Kandu; pramlocaya--by a heavenly society girl named Pramloca; labdha--obtained;
kanya--daughter; kamala-locana--lotus-eyed; tam--her; ca--also; apaviddham--given up; jagrhuh--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O sons of King Pracinabarhisat, the heavenly society girl named Pramloca kept the lotus-eyed daughter
of Kandu in the care of the forest trees. Then she went back to the heavenly planet. This daughter was
born by the coupling of the Apsara named Pramloca with the sage Kandu.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power, the King of heaven, Indra,
becomes very envious. All the demigods have responsible posts for the management of universal affairs
and are very highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living entities, they are able
to attain responsible posts, like Lord Brahma, Indra, Candra and Varuna. As is the nature of this material
world, the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe austerities. The whole
material world is filled with such envy that everyone becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman
is afraid of his associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds of envious
people who have come here to compete with the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus
Indra was very much afraid of the severe austerities performed by the great sage Kandu, and he sent
Pramloca to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place in the case of Visvamitra. From
other incidents in the sastras, it appears that Indra has always been envious. When King Prthu was
celebrating various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he disturbed King Prthu's
sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking
the vow of the great sage Kandu, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society girl
Pramloca and begot a female child. This child is described herein as lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being
thus successful in her mission, Pramloca returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to
the care of the trees. Fortunately, the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her.
