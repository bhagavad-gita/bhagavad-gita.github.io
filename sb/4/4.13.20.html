<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the great demigods, controllers of universal
affairs. When He is satisfied, nothing is impossible to achieve. For this reason all the demigods, presiding
deities of different planets, as well as the inhabitants of their planets, take great pleasure in offering all
kinds of paraphernalia for His worship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All Vedic civilization is summarized in this verse: all living entities, either on this planet or on other
planets, have to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by their respective duties. When He is
satisfied, all necessities of life are automatically supplied. In the Vedas it is also stated: eko bahunam yo
vidadhati kaman (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). From the Vedas we understand that He is supplying everyone's
necessities, and we can actually see that the lower animals, the birds and the bees, have no business or
profession, yet they are not dying for want of food. They are all living in nature's way, and they all have
the necessities of life provided--namely eating, sleeping, mating and defending.
Human society, however, has artificially created a type of civilization which makes one forgetful of his
relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Modern society even enables one to forget the
Supreme Personality of Godhead's grace and mercy. Consequently modern civilized man is always
unhappy and in need of things. People do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to approach Lord
Visnu and satisfy Him. They have taken this materialistic way of life as everything and have become
captivated by materialistic activities. Indeed, their leaders are always encouraging them to follow this
path, and the general populace, being ignorant of the laws of God, are following their blind leaders down
the path of unhappiness. In order to rectify this world situation, all people should be trained in Krsna
consciousness and act in accordance with the varnasrama system. The state should also see that the
people are engaged in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the primary duty of the
state. The Krsna consciousness movement was started to convince the general populace to adopt the best
process by which to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus solve all problems.
