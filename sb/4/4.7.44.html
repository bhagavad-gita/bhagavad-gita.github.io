<h2>Translation</h2>
The Vidyadharas said: Dear Lord, this human form of body is meant for attaining the highest
perfectional objective, but, impelled by Your external energy, the living entity misidentifies himself with
his body and with the material energy, and therefore, influenced by maya, he wants to become happy by
material enjoyment. He is misled and always attracted by temporary, illusory happiness. But Your
transcendental activities are so powerful that if one engages in the hearing and chanting of such topics, he
can be delivered from illusion.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The human form of life is called arthada because the body can very nicely help the embodied soul to
achieve the highest perfection. Prahlada Maharaja said that even though temporary, the body can give us
the highest perfectional achievement. In the process of evolution from the lower to the higher grade of
living, the human form of life is a great boon. But maya is so strong that in spite of achieving this great
boon of the human form of life, we are influenced by temporary material happiness, and we forget our
goal of life. We are attracted by things which will cease to exist. The beginning of such attraction is the
temporary body. In this horrible condition of life there is only one way of liberation--to engage in the
activities of transcendental chanting and hearing of the holy name of the Supreme Lord: Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. The words yusmatkathamrta-
nisevakah mean "those who engage in relishing the nectar of the topics of Your Lordship."
There are two narrative books which especially concern the words and activities of Krsna. Bhagavad-gita
is the instruction given by Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is the book containing topics exclusively about
Krsna and His devotees. These two books are the special nectar of the words of Krsna. For those who
engage in the preaching of these two Vedic literatures it is very easy to get out of the illusory conditional
life imposed upon us by maya. The illusion is that the conditioned soul does not try to understand his
spiritual identity. He is more interested in his external body, which is only a flash and which will be
finished as soon as the time is designated. The whole atmosphere will change when the living entity has to
transmigrate from one body to another. Under the spell of maya, he will again be satisfied in a different
atmosphere. This spell of maya is called avaranatmika sakti because it is so strong that the living entity is
satisfied in any abominable condition. Even if he is born as a worm living within the intestine or abdomen
in the midst of urine and stool, still he is satisfied. This is the covering influence of maya. But the human
form of life is a chance to understand, and if one misses this opportunity, he is most unfortunate. The way
to get out of illusory maya is to engage in the topics of Krsna. Lord Caitanya advocated a process whereby
everyone may remain in his present position without change but simply hear from the proper
authoritative sources about Krsna. Lord Caitanya advised everyone to spread the word of Krsna. He
advised, "All of you become spiritual masters. Your duty is simply to talk to whomever you meet of Krsna
or of the instructions given by Krsna." The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is operating
for this purpose. We do not ask anyone to first change his position and then come to us. Instead, we
invite everyone to come with us and simply chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare
Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, because we know that if one simply chants and hears the
topics of Krsna, one's life will change; he will see a new light, and his life will be successful.
