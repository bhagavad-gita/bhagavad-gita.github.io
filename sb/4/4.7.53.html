<h2>Translation</h2>
O son of the King, now I shall speak unto you the mantra which is to be chanted with this process of
meditation. One who carefully chants this mantra for seven nights can see the perfect human beings flying
in the sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Within this universe there is a planet called Siddhaloka. The inhabitants of Siddhaloka are by nature
perfect in the yoga achievements, which are of eight varieties: one can become smaller than the smallest,
lighter than the lightest, or bigger than the biggest; one can immediately get whatever he likes, one can
even create a planet, etc. These are some of the yogic perfections. By virtue of the laghima-siddhi, or
purificatory process to become lighter than the lightest, the inhabitants of Siddhaloka can fly in the sky
without airplanes or airships. It is hinted herein by Narada Muni to Dhruva Maharaja that by meditating
upon the transcendental form of the Lord and at the same time chanting the mantra one becomes so
perfect within seven days that he can see the human beings who fly in the sky. Narada Muni uses the
word japah, which indicates that the mantra to be chanted is very confidential. One may ask, "If it is
confidential, why is it mentioned in the writing of Srimad-Bhagavatam?" It is confidential in this sense:
one may receive a published mantra anywhere, but unless it is accepted through the chain of disciplic
succession, the mantra does not act. It is said by authoritative sources that any mantra chanted without
having been received from the disciplic succession has no efficacy.
Another point established in this verse is that meditation should be carried on with the chanting of a
mantra. Chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is the easiest process of meditation in this age. As soon as one
chants the Hare Krsna mantra, he sees the forms of Krsna, Rama and Their energies, and that is the
perfect stage of trance. One should not artificially try to see the form of the Lord while chanting Hare
Krsna, but when the chanting is performed offenselessly the Lord will automatically reveal Himself to the
view of the chanter. The chanter, therefore, has to concentrate on hearing the vibration, and without extra
endeavor on his part, the Lord will automatically appear.
