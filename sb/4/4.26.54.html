<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, woman, who is very attractive in the beginning but in the end very disturbing, is exactly
like the flower, which is attractive in the beginning and detestable at the end. With woman, the living
entity is entangled with lusty desires, and he enjoys sex, just as one enjoys the aroma of a flower. He thus
enjoys a life of sense gratification--from his tongue to his genitals--and in this way the living entity
considers himself very happy in family life. United with his wife, he always remains absorbed in such
thoughts. He feels great pleasure in hearing the talks of his wife and children, which are like the sweet
humming of bumblebees that collect honey from flower to flower. He forgets that before him is time,
which is taking away his life-span with the passing of day and night. He does not see the gradual
diminishing of his life, nor does he care about the superintendent of death, who is trying to kill him from
behind. Just try to understand this. You are in a precarious position and are threatened from all sides.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialistic life means forgetting one's constitutional position as the eternal servant of Krsna, and this
forgetfulness is especially enhanced in the grhastha-asrama. In the grhastha-asrama a young man accepts a
young wife who is very beautiful in the beginning, but in due course of time, after giving birth to many
children and becoming older and older, she demands many things from the husband to maintain the
entire family. At such a time the wife becomes detestable to the very man who accepted her in her
younger days. One becomes attached to the grhastha-asrama for two reasons only--the wife cooks
palatable dishes for the satisfaction of her husband's tongue, and she gives him sexual pleasure at night. A
person attached to the grhastha-asrama is always thinking of these two things--palatable food and sex
enjoyment. The talks of the wife, which are enjoyed as a family recreation, and the talks of the children
both attract the living entity. He thus forgets that he has to die someday and has to prepare for the next
life if he wants to be put into a congenial body.
The deer in the flower garden is an allegory used by the great sage Narada to point out to the King that
the King himself is similarly entrapped by such surroundings. Actually everyone is surrounded by such a
family life, which misleads one. The living entity thus forgets that he has to return home, back to
Godhead. He simply becomes entangled in family life. Prahlada Maharaja has therefore hinted: hitvatmapatam
grham andha-kupam vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta. Family life is considered a blind well
(andha-kupam) into which a person falls and dies without help. Prahlada Maharaja recommends that
while one's senses are there and one is strong enough, he should abandon the grhastha-asrama and take
shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, going to the forest of Vrndavana. According to Vedic civilization, one
has to give up family life at a certain age (the age of fifty), take vanaprastha and eventually remain alone
as a sannyasi. That is the prescribed method of Vedic civilization known as varnasrama-dharma. When
one takes sannyasa after enjoying family life, he pleases the Supreme Lord Visnu.
One has to understand one's position in family or worldly life. That is called intelligence. One should
not remain always trapped in family life to satisfy his tongue and genitals in association with a wife. In
such a way, one simply spoils his life. According to Vedic civilization, it is imperative to give up the family
at a certain stage, by force if necessary. Unfortunately, so-called followers of Vedic life do not give up their
family even at the end of life, unless they are forced by death. There should be a thorough overhauling of
the social system, and society should revert to the Vedic principles, that is, the four varnas and the four
asramas.
