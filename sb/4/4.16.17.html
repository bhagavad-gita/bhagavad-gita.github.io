<h2>Text</h2>
matr-bhaktih para-strisu
patnyam ardha ivatmanah
prajasu pitrvat snigdhah
kinkaro brahma-vadinam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
matr-bhaktih--as respectful as one is to his mother; para-strisu--to other women; patnyam--to his own
wife; ardhah--half; iva--like; atmanah--of his body; prajasu--unto the citizens; pitr-vat--like a father;
snigdhah--affectionate; kinkarah--servant; brahma-vadinam--of the devotees who preach the glories of the
Lord.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King will respect all women as if they were his own mother, and he will treat his own wife as the
other half of his body. He will be just like an affectionate father to his citizens, and he will treat himself as
the most obedient servant of the devotees, who always preach the glories of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A learned man treats all women except his wife as his mother, looks on others' property as garbage in
the street, and treats others as he would treat his own self. These are the symptoms of a learned person as
described by Canakya Pandita. This should be the standard for education. Education does not mean
having academic degrees only. One should execute what he has learned in his personal life. These learned
characteristics were verily manifest in the life of King Prthu. Although he was the king, he treated himself
as a servant of the Lord's devotees. According to Vedic etiquette, if a devotee came to a king's palace, the
king would immediately offer his own seat to him. The word brahma-vadinam is very significant. Brahmavadi
refers to the devotees of the Lord. Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan are different terms for the
Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman is Lord Krsna. This is accepted in Bhagavad-gita (10.12) by
Arjuna (param brahma param dhama). Thus the word brahma-vadinam refers to the devotees of the Lord.
The state should always serve the devotees of the Lord, and the ideal state should conduct itself according
to the instructions of the devotee. Because King Prthu followed this principle, he is highly praised.
