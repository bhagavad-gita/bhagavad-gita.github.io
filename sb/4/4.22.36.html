<h2>Text</h2>
pare 'vare ca ye bhava
guna-vyatikarad anu
na tesam vidyate ksemam
isa-vidhvamsitasisam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pare--in the higher status of life; avare--in the lower status of life; ca--and; ye--all those; bhavah--
conceptions; guna--material qualities; vyatikarat--by interaction; anu--following; na--never; tesam--of
them; vidyate--exist; ksemam--correction; isa--the Supreme Lord; vidhvamsita--destroyed; asisam--of the
blessings.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We accept as blessings different states of higher life, distinguishing them from lower states of life, but
we should know that such distinctions exist only in relation to the interchange of the modes of material
nature. Actually these states of life have no permanent existence, for all of them will be destroyed by the
supreme controller.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In our material existence we accept a higher form of life as a blessing and a lower form as a curse. This
distinction of "higher" and "lower" only exists as long as the different material qualities (gunas) interact.
In other words, by our good activities we are elevated to the higher planetary systems or to a higher
standard of life (good education, beautiful body, etc.). These are the results of pious activities. Similarly,
by impious activities we remain illiterate, get ugly bodies, a poor standard of living, etc. But all these
different states of life are under the laws of material nature through the interaction of the qualities of
goodness, passion and ignorance. However, all these qualities will cease to act at the time of the
dissolution of the entire cosmic manifestation. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
Even though we elevate ourselves to the highest planetary system by the scientific advancement of
knowledge or by the religious principles of life--great sacrifices and fruitive activities--at the time of
dissolution these higher planetary systems and life on them will be destroyed. In this verse the words isavidhvamsitasisam
indicate that all such blessings will be destroyed by the supreme controller. We will not
be protected. Our bodies, either in this planet or in another planet, will be destroyed, and again we will
have to remain for millions of years in an unconscious state within the body of Maha-Visnu. And again,
when the creation is manifested, we have to take birth in different species of life and begin our activities.
Therefore we should not be satisfied simply by a promotion to the higher planetary systems. We should
try to get out of the material cosmic manifestation, go to the spiritual world and take shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is our highest achievement. We should not be attracted by
anything material, higher or lower, but should consider them all on the same level. Our real engagement
should be in inquiring about the real purpose of life and rendering devotional service to the Lord. Thus
we will be eternally blessed in our spiritual activities, full of knowledge and bliss.
Regulated human civilization promotes dharma, artha, kama and moksa. In human society there must
be religion. Without religion, human society is only animal society. Economic development and sense
gratification must be based on religious principles. When religion, economic development and sense
gratification are adjusted, liberation from this material birth, death, old age and disease is assured. In the
present age of Kali, however, there is no question of religion and liberation. People have taken interest
only in economic development and sense gratification. Therefore, despite sufficient economic
development all over the world, dealings in human society have become almost animalistic. When
everything becomes grossly animalistic, dissolution takes place. This dissolution is to be accepted as isavidhvamsitasisam.
The Lord's so-called blessings of economic development and sense gratification will be
conclusively dissolved by destruction. At the end of this Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as the incarnation
of Kalki, and His only business will be to kill all human beings on the surface of the globe. After that
killing, another golden age will begin. We should therefore know that our material activities are just like
childish play. Children may play on the beach, and the father will sit and watch this childish play, the
construction of buildings with sand, the construction of walls and so many things, but finally the father
will ask the children to come home. Then everything is destroyed. Persons who are too much addicted to
the childish activities of economic development and sense gratification are sometimes especially favored
by the Lord when He destroys their construction of these things.
It is said by the Lord: yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih. The Lord told Yudhisthira
Maharaja that His special favor is shown to His devotee when He takes away all the devotee's material
opulences. Generally, therefore, it is experienced that Vaisnavas are not very opulent in the material
sense. When a Vaisnava, pure devotee, tries to be materially opulent and at the same time desires to serve
the Supreme Lord, his devotional service is checked. The Lord, in order to show him a special favor,
destroys his so-called economic development and material opulences. Thus the devotee, being frustrated
in his repeated attempts at economic development, ultimately takes solid shelter under the lotus feet of
the Lord. This kind of action may also be accepted as isa-vidhvam-sitasisam, whereby the Lord destroys
one's material opulences but enriches one in spiritual understanding. In the course of our preaching work,
we sometimes see that materialistic persons come to us and offer their obeisances to take blessings, which
means they want more and more material opulences. If such material opulences are checked, such
persons are no longer interested in offering obeisances to the devotees. Such materialistic persons are
always concerned about their economic development. They offer obeisances to saintly persons or the
Supreme Lord and give something in charity for preaching work with a view that they will be rewarded
with further economic development.
However, when one is sincere in his devotional service, the Lord obliges the devotee to give up his
material development and completely surrender unto Him. Because the Lord does not give blessings of
material opulence to His devotee, people are afraid of worshiping Lord Visnu because they see that the
Vaisnavas, who are worshipers of Lord Visnu, are poor in superficial material opulences. Such
materialistic persons, however, get immense opportunity for economic development by worshiping Lord
Siva, for Lord Siva is the husband of the goddess Durga, the proprietor of this universe. By the grace of
Lord Siva, a devotee gets the opportunity to be blessed by the goddess Durga. Ravana, for example, was a
great worshiper and devotee of Lord Siva, and in return he got all the blessings of goddess Durga, so much
so that his whole kingdom was constructed of golden buildings. In Brazil, in this present age, huge
quantities of gold have been found, and from historical references in the Puranas, we can guess safely that
this was Ravana's kingdom. This kingdom was, however, destroyed by Lord Ramacandra.
By studying such incidents, we can understand the full meaning of isa-vidhvamsitasisam. The Lord does
not bestow material blessings upon the devotees, for they may be entrapped again in this material world
by continuous birth, death, old age and disease. Due to materialistic opulences, persons like Ravana
become puffed up for sense gratification. Ravana even dared kidnap Sita, who was both the wife of Lord
Ramacandra and the goddess of fortune, thinking that he would be able to enjoy the pleasure potency of
the Lord. But actually, by such action, Ravana became vidhvamsita, or ruined. At the present moment
human civilization is too much attached to economic development and sense gratification and is therefore
nearing the path of ruination.
