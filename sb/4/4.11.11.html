<h2>Text</h2>
sarvatmany acyute 'sarve
tivraugham bhaktim udvahan
dadarsatmani bhutesu
tam evavasthitam vibhum
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarva-atmani--unto the Supersoul; acyute--infallible; asarve--without any limit; tivra-ogham--with
unrelenting force; bhaktim--devotional service; udvahan--rendering; dadarsa--he saw; atmani--in the
Supreme Spirit; bhutesu--in all living entities; tam--Him; eva--only; avasthitam--situated; vibhum--allpowerful.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja rendered devotional service unto the Supreme, the reservoir of everything, with
unrelenting force. While carrying out his devotional service to the Lord, he could see that everything is
situated in Him only and that He is situated in all living entities. The Lord is called Acyuta because He
never fails in His prime duty, to give protection to His devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Not only did Dhruva Maharaja perform many sacrifices, but he carried on his transcendental occupation
of engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. The ordinary karmis, who want to enjoy the results
of fruitive activities, are concerned only with sacrifices and ritualistic ceremonies as enjoined in the Vedic
sastras. Although Dhruva Maharaja performed many sacrifices in order to be an exemplary king, he was
constantly engaged in devotional service. The Lord always protects His surrendered devotee. A devotee
can see that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (isvarah sarvabhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati). Ordinary persons cannot understand how the Supreme Lord is
situated in everyone's heart, but a devotee can actually see Him. Not only can the devotee see Him
outwardly, but he can see, with spiritual vision, that everything is resting in the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, as described in Bhagavad-gita (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani). That is the vision of a mahabhagavata.
He sees everything others see, but instead of seeing merely the trees, the mountains, the cities
or the sky, he sees only his worshipable Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything because
everything is resting in Him only. This is the vision of the maha-bhagavata. In summary, a mahabhagavata,
a highly elevated pure devotee, sees the Lord everywhere, as well as within the heart of
everyone. This is possible for devotees who have developed elevated devotional service to the Lord. As
stated in the Brahma-samhita (5.38), premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: only those who have
smeared their eyes with the ointment of love of Godhead can see everywhere the Supreme Lord face to
face; it is not possible by imagination or so-called meditation.
