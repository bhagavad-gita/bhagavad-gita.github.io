<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the mental scope of even demigods like Brahma was unable to comprehend the unlimited
glories of the Supreme Lord, they were all able to perceive the transcendental form of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by His grace. Only by such grace could they offer their respectful prayers
according to their different capacities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always unlimited, and His glories cannot be
completely enumerated by anyone, even by a personality like Lord Brahma. It is said that Ananta, a direct
incarnation of the Lord, has unlimited mouths, and with each mouth He has been trying to describe the
glories of the Lord for an unlimited span of time, yet the glories of the Lord remain unlimited, and He
therefore never finishes. It is not possible for any ordinary living entity to understand or to glorify the
unlimited Personality of Godhead, but one can offer prayers or service to the Lord according to one's
particular capacity. This capacity is increased by the service spirit. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau means that
the service of the Lord begins with the tongue. This refers to chanting. By chanting Hare Krsna, one
begins the service of the Lord. Another function of the tongue is to taste and accept the Lord's prasada.
We have to begin our service to the Unlimited with the tongue and become perfect in chanting, and
accepting the Lord's prasada. To accept the Lord's prasada means to control the entire set of senses. The
tongue is considered to be the most uncontrollable sense because it hankers for so many unwholesome
eatables, thereby forcing the living entity into the dungeon of material conditional life. As the living entity
transmigrates from one form of life to another, he has to eat so many abominable foodstuffs that finally
there is no limit. The tongue should be engaged in chanting and in eating the Lord's prasada so that the
other senses will be controlled. Chanting is the medicine, and prasada is the diet. With these processes
one can begin his service, and as the service increases, the Lord reveals more and more to the devotee. But
there is no limit to His glories, and there is no limit to engaging oneself in the service of the Lord.
