<h2>Text</h2>
pratyudgama-prasrayanabhivadanam
vidhiyate sadhu mithah sumadhyame
prajnaih parasmai purusaya cetasa
guha-sayayaiva na deha-manine
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pratyudgama--standing up from one's seat; prasrayana--welcoming; abhivadanam--obeisances;
vidhiyate--are intended; sadhu--proper; mithah--mutually; su-madhyame--my dear young wife; prajnaih--
by the wise; parasmai--unto the Supreme; purusaya--unto the Supersoul; cetasa--with the intelligence;
guha-sayaya--sitting within the body; eva--certainly; na--not; deha-manine--to the person identifying with
the body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear young wife, certainly friends and relatives offer mutual greetings by standing up, welcoming
one another and offering obeisances. But those who are elevated to the transcendental platform, being
intelligent, offer such respects to the Supersoul, who is sitting within the body, not to the person who
identifies with the body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It may be argued that since Daksa was the father-in-law of Lord Siva, it was certainly the duty of Lord
Siva to offer him respect. In answer to that argument it is explained here that when a learned person
stands up or offers obeisances in welcome, he offers respect to the Supersoul, who is sitting within
everyone's heart. It is seen, therefore, among Vaisnavas, that even when a disciple offers obeisances to his
spiritual master, the spiritual master immediately returns the obeisances because they are mutually offered
not to the body but to the Supersoul. Therefore the spiritual master also offers respect to the Supersoul
situated in the body of the disciple. The Lord says in Srimad-Bhagavatam that offering respect to His
devotee is more valuable than offering respect to Him. Devotees do not identify with the body, so offering
respect to a Vaisnava means offering respect to Visnu. It is stated also that as a matter of etiquette as soon
as one sees a Vaisnava one must immediately offer him respect, indicating the Supersoul sitting within. A
Vaisnava sees the body as a temple of Visnu. Since Lord Siva had already offered respect to the Supersoul
in Krsna consciousness, offering respect to Daksa, who identified with his body, was already performed.
There was no need to offer respect to his body, for that is not directed by any Vedic injunction.
