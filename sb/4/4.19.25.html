sa uttamasloka mahan-mukha-cyuto

kuyoginam no vitaraty alam varaih
<p></p>

delivered from the mouths; bhavat--Your; pada-ambhoja--from the lotus feet; sudha--of nectar;
kana--particles; anilah--soothing breeze; smrtim--remembrance; punah--again; vismrta--forgotten; tattva--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are glorified by the selected verses uttered by great personalities. Such glorification
of Your lotus feet is just like saffron particles. When the transcendental vibration from the mouths of great
devotees carries the aroma of the saffron dust of Your lotus feet, the forgetful living entity gradually
remembers his eternal relationship with You. Devotees thus gradually come to the right conclusion about
the value of life. My dear Lord, I therefore do not need any other benediction but the opportunity to hear
from the mouth of Your pure devotee.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is explained in the previous verse that one has to hear glorification of the Lord from the mouth of a
pure devotee. This is further explained here. The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure
devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity's memory of his eternal relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory maya, we have
almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who
forgets his duties. In the Vedas it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of maya. We
must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility
of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by Thakura Bhaktivinoda, Lord Caitanya says, jiva jaga,
jiva jaga. The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his
mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a
pure devotee.
A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore
he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord.
Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this
material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the
lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the
mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up
until that moment he had forgotten everything.
For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is
fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or
contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is kuyogi because we have engaged in the
service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving
servants. It is our duty to rise from the kuyoga platform to become suyogis, perfect mystics. The process
of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. One may stay in his position of life--it does not matter what it is--but if one hears from the
mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and
thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of
hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual
understanding.
