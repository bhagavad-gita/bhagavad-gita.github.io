<h2>Text</h2>
bahubhyam asvinoh pusno
hastabhyam krta-bahavah
bhavantv adhvaryavas canye
basta-smasrur bhrgur bhavet
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bahubhyam--with two arms; asvinoh--of Asvini-kumara; pusnah--of Pusa; hastabhyam--with two hands;
krta-bahavah--those in need of arms; bhavantu--they will have to; adhvaryavah--the priests; ca--and;
anye--others; basta-smasruh--the beard of the goat; bhrguh--Bhrgu; bhavet--he may have.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who have had their arms cut off will have to work with the arms of Asvini-kumara, and those
whose hands were cut off will have to do their work with the hands of Pusa. The priests will also have to
act in that manner. As for Bhrgu, he will have the beard from the goat's head.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhrgu Muni, a great supporter of Daksa, was awarded the beard of the goat's head which was substituted
for the head of Daksa. It appears from the exchange of Daksa's head that the modern scientific theory that
the brain substance is the cause of all intelligent work is not valid. The brain substance of Daksa and that
of a goat are different, but Daksa still acted like himself, even though his head was replaced by that of a
goat. The conclusion is that it is the particular consciousness of an individual soul which acts. The brain
substance is only an instrument which has nothing to do with real intelligence. The real intelligence,
mind and consciousness are part of the particular individual soul. It will be found in the verses ahead that
after Daksa's head was replaced by the goat's head, he was as intelligent as he had previously been. He
prayed very nicely to satisfy Lord Siva and Lord Visnu, which is not possible for a goat to do. Therefore it
is definitely concluded that the brain substance is not the center of intelligence; it is the consciousness of
a particular soul that works intelligently. The whole movement of Krsna consciousness is to purify the
consciousness. It doesn't matter what kind of brain one has because if he simply transfers his
consciousness from matter to Krsna, his life becomes successful. It is confirmed by the Lord Himself in
Bhagavad-gita that anyone who takes up Krsna consciousness achieves the highest perfection of life,
regardless of whatever abominable condition of life he may have fallen into. Specifically, anyone in Krsna
consciousness goes back to Godhead, back to home, on leaving his present material body.
