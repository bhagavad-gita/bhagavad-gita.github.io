hitva grhan sutan bhogan
vaidarbhi madireksana
anvadhavata pandyesam
jyotsneva rajani-karam
SYNONYMS
hitva--giving up; grhan--home; sutan--children; bhogan--material happiness; vaidarbhi--the daughter of
King Vidarbha; madira-iksana--with enchanting eyes; anvadhavata--followed; pandya-isam--King
Malayadhvaja; jyotsna iva--like the moonshine; rajani-karam--the moon.
TRANSLATION
Just as the moonshine follows the moon at night, immediately after King Malayadhvaja departed for
Kulacala, his devoted wife, whose eyes were very enchanting, followed him, giving up all homely
happiness, despite family and children.
PURPORT
Just as in the vanaprastha stage the wife follows the husband, similarly when the spiritual master retires
for nirjana-bhajana, some of his advanced devotees follow him and engage in his personal service. In
other words, those who are very fond of family life should come forward in the service of the spiritual
master and abandon so-called happiness afforded by society, friendship and love. A verse by Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura in his Gurv-astaka is significant in this regard. Yasya prasadad bhagavatprasadah.
A disciple should always remember that by serving the spiritual master he can easily advance in
Krsna consciousness. All the scriptures recommend that it is by pleasing the spiritual master and serving
him directly that one can attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service.
The word madireksana is also significant in this verse. Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained in his Sandarbha
that the word madira means "intoxicating." If one's eyes become intoxicated upon seeing the Deity, he
may be called madireksana. Queen Vaidarbhi's eyes were very enchanting, just as one's eyes are
madireksana when engaged in seeing the temple Deity. Unless one is an advanced devotee, he cannot fix
his eyes on the Deity in the temple.

tat-punya-salilair nityam

SYNONYMS
tatra--there; candravasa--the Candravasa River; nama--named; tamraparni--the Tamraparni River;
vatodaka--the Vatodaka River; tat--of those rivers; punya--pious; salilaih--with the waters; nityam--daily;
ubhayatra--in both ways; atmanah--of himself; mrjan--washing; kanda--bulbs; astibhih--and by seeds;
mula--roots; phalaih--and by fruits; puspa--flowers; parnaih--and by leaves; trna--grass; udakaih--and by
water; vartamanah--subsisting; sanaih--gradually; gatra--his body; karsanam--rendering thin; tapah--
austerity; asthitah--he underwent.
TRANSLATION
In the province of Kulacala, there were rivers named Candravasa, Tamraparni and Vatodaka. King
Malayadhvaja used to go to those pious rivers regularly and take his bath there. Thus he purified himself
externally and internally. He took his bath and ate bulbs, seeds, leaves, flowers, roots, fruits and grasses
and drank water. In this way he underwent severe austerities. Eventually he became very skinny.
PURPORT
We can definitely see that to advance in Krsna consciousness one must control his bodily weight. If one
becomes too fat, it is to be assumed that he is not advancing spiritually. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura severely criticized his fat disciples. The idea is that one who intends to advance in Krsna
consciousness must not eat very much. Devotees used to go to forests, high hills or mountains on
pilgrimages, but such severe austerities are not possible in these days. One should instead eat only prasada
and no more than required. According to the Vaisnava calendar, there are many fasts, such as Ekadasi and
the appearance and disappearance days of God and His devotees. All of these are meant to decrease the fat
within the body so that one will not sleep more than desired and will not become inactive and lazy.
Overindulgence in food will cause a man to sleep more than required. This human form of life is meant
for austerity, and austerity means controlling sex, food intake, etc. In this way time can be saved for
spiritual activity, and one can purify himself both externally and internally. Thus both body and mind can
be cleansed.
