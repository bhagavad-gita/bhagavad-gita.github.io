<h2>Translation</h2>
The palace of the King was surrounded by walls made of marble with many engravings made of valuable
jewels like sapphires, which depicted beautiful women with shining jewel lamps in their hands.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The description of King Uttanapada's palace depicts the state of affairs many hundreds and thousands of
years ago, long before Srimad-Bhagavatam was compiled. Since it is described that Maharaja Dhruva ruled
for thirty-six thousand years, he must have lived in the Satya-yuga, when people lived for one hundred
thousand years. The life durations in the four yugas are also mentioned in the Vedic literature. In the
Satya-yuga people used to live for one hundred thousand years, in the Treta-yuga people lived for ten
thousand years, in Dvapara-yuga they lived for one thousand years, and in this age, Kali-yuga, people may
live up to one hundred years. With the progressive advance of each new yuga, the duration of human life
is reduced by ninety percent--from one hundred thousand to ten thousand, from ten thousand to one
thousand, and from one thousand to one hundred.
It is said that Dhruva Maharaja was the great-grandson of Lord Brahma. This indicates that Dhruva
Maharaja's time was in the Satya-yuga in the beginning of creation. During one day of Lord Brahma, as
stated in the Bhagavad-gita, there are many Satya-yugas. According to the Vedic calculation, at the present
moment the twenty-eighth millennium is current. It can be calculated that Dhruva Maharaja lived many
millions of years ago, but the description of the palace of Dhruva's father is so glorious that we cannot
accept that advanced human civilization did not exist even forty or fifty thousand years ago. There were
walls like those in the palace of Maharaja Uttanapada even very recently, during the Mogul period.
Anyone who has seen the Red Fort in Delhi must have marked that the walls are made of marble and were
once decorated with jewels. During the British period all these jewels were taken away and dispatched to
the British Museum.
The conception of worldly opulence was formerly based mainly on natural resources such as jewels,
marble, silk, ivory, gold and silver. The advancement of economic development was not based on big
motorcars. Advancement of human civilization depends not on industrial enterprises, but on possession
of natural wealth and natural food, which is all supplied by the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that
we may save time for self-realization and success in the human form of body.
Another aspect of this verse is that Dhruva Maharaja's father, Uttanapada, would very soon give up
attachment for his palaces and would go to the forest for self-realization. From the description of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, therefore, we can make a very thorough comparative study of modern civilization and the
civilization of mankind in the other millenniums, Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga and Dvapara-yuga.
