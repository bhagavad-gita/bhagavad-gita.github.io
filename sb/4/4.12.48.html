prayatah kirtayet pratah
samavaye dvi-janmanam
sayam ca punya-slokasya
dhruvasya caritam mahat
SYNONYMS
prayatah--with great care; kirtayet--one should chant; pratah--in the morning; samavaye--in the
association; dvi-janmanam--of the twice-born; sayam--in the evening; ca--also; punya-slokasya--of sacred
renown; dhruvasya--of Dhruva; caritam--character; mahat--great.
TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya recommended: One should chant of the character and activities of Dhruva
Maharaja both in the morning and in the evening, with great attention and care, in a society of brahmanas
or other twice-born persons.
PURPORT
It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character and
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. In this verse it is especially
recommended that Dhruva Maharaja's character be discussed in a society of the twice-born, which refers
to the qualified brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. One should especially seek the society of brahmanas
who are elevated to the position of Vaisnavas. Thus discussion of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which describes the
character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord, is very quickly effective. The International Society for
Krishna Consciousness has been organized for this purpose. In every center of this Society--not only in
the morning, evening or noon, but practically twenty-four hours a day--there is continuous devotional
service going on. Anyone who comes in contact with the Society automatically becomes a devotee. We
have actual experience that many karmis and others come to the Society and find a very pleasing and
peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse the word dvi janmanam means "of the twiceborn."
Anyone can join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and be initiated to become
twice-born. As recommended by Sanatana Gosvami, by the process of initiation and authorized training,
any man can become twice-born. The first birth is made possible by the parents, and the second birth is
made possible by the spiritual father and Vedic knowledge. Unless one is twice-born one cannot
understand the transcendental characteristics of the Lord and His devotees. Study of the Vedas is therefore
forbidden for sudras. Simply by academic qualifications a sudra cannot understand the transcendental
science. At the present moment, throughout the entire world the educational system is geared to produce
sudras. A big technologist is no more than a big sudra. Kalau sudra-sambhavah: in the age of Kali,
everyone is a sudra. Because the whole population of the world consists only of sudras, there is a decline
of spiritual knowledge, and people are unhappy. The Krsna consciousness movement has been started
especially to create qualified brahmanas to broadcast spiritual knowledge all over the world, for thus
people may become very happy.

SYNONYMS
paurnamasyam--on the full moon; sinivalyam--on the dark moon; dvadasyam--on the day after Ekadasi;
sravane--during the Sravana star's appearance; athava--or; dina-ksaye--at the end of the tithi; vyatipate--a

Personality of Godhead; pada-asrayah--taken shelter of the lotus feet; na icchan--without desiring
remuneration; tatra--there; atmana--by the self; atmanam--the mind; santustah--pacified; iti--thus;
sidhyati--becomes perfect.
TRANSLATION
Persons who have completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord should recite this narration of
Dhruva Maharaja without taking remuneration. Specifically, recitation is recommended on the full moon
or dark moon day, on the day after Ekadasi, on the appearance of the Sravana star, at the end of a
particular tithi, or the occasion of Vyatipata, at the end of the month, or on Sunday. Such recitation
should of course be performed before a favorable audience. When recitation is performed this way,
without professional motive, the reciter and audience become perfect.
PURPORT
Professional reciters may ask money to extinguish the blazing fire within their bellies, but they cannot
make any spiritual improvement or become perfect. It is therefore strictly forbidden to recite Srimad-
Bhagavatam as a profession to earn a livelihood. Only one who is completely surrendered at the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, depending fully on Him for personal maintenance or even for
maintenance of his family, can attain perfection by recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is full of
narrations of the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. The process can be summarized as follows: the
audience must be faithfully receptive to the Bhagavata message, and the reciter should completely depend
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavata recitation must not be a business. If done in the right
way, not only does the reciter achieve perfect satisfaction, but the Lord also is very satisfied with the
reciter and the audience, and thus both are liberated from material bondage simply by the process of
hearing.
