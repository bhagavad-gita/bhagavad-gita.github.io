<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya recommended: One should chant of the character and activities of Dhruva
Maharaja both in the morning and in the evening, with great attention and care, in a society of brahmanas
or other twice-born persons.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that only in the association of devotees can one understand the importance of the character and
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees. In this verse it is especially
recommended that Dhruva Maharaja's character be discussed in a society of the twice-born, which refers
to the qualified brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas. One should especially seek the society of brahmanas
who are elevated to the position of Vaisnavas. Thus discussion of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which describes the
character and pastimes of devotees and the Lord, is very quickly effective. The International Society for
Krishna Consciousness has been organized for this purpose. In every center of this Society--not only in
the morning, evening or noon, but practically twenty-four hours a day--there is continuous devotional
service going on. Anyone who comes in contact with the Society automatically becomes a devotee. We
have actual experience that many karmis and others come to the Society and find a very pleasing and
peaceful atmosphere in the temples of ISKCON. In this verse the word dvi janmanam means "of the twiceborn."
Anyone can join the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and be initiated to become
twice-born. As recommended by Sanatana Gosvami, by the process of initiation and authorized training,
any man can become twice-born. The first birth is made possible by the parents, and the second birth is
made possible by the spiritual father and Vedic knowledge. Unless one is twice-born one cannot
understand the transcendental characteristics of the Lord and His devotees. Study of the Vedas is therefore
forbidden for sudras. Simply by academic qualifications a sudra cannot understand the transcendental
science. At the present moment, throughout the entire world the educational system is geared to produce
sudras. A big technologist is no more than a big sudra. Kalau sudra-sambhavah: in the age of Kali,
everyone is a sudra. Because the whole population of the world consists only of sudras, there is a decline
of spiritual knowledge, and people are unhappy. The Krsna consciousness movement has been started
especially to create qualified brahmanas to broadcast spiritual knowledge all over the world, for thus
people may become very happy.
