TRANSLATION
The fortunate inhabitants of Pitrloka, who preside over the funeral ceremonies, made Aryama into a
calf. With great faith they milked kavya, food offered to the ancestors, into an unbaked earthen pot.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (9.25) it is said, pitrn yanti pitr-vratah. Those who are interested in family welfare are
called pitr-vratah. There is a planet called Pitrloka, and the predominating deity of that planet is called
Aryama. He is somewhat of a demigod, and by satisfying him one can help ghostly family members
develop a gross body. Those who are very sinful and attached to their family, house, village or country do
not receive a gross body made of material elements but remain in a subtle body, composed of mind, ego
and intelligence. Those who live in such subtle bodies are called ghosts. This ghostly position is very
painful because a ghost has intelligence, mind and ego and wants to enjoy material life, but because he
doesn't have a gross material body, he can only create disturbances for want of material satisfaction. It is
the duty of family members, especially the son, to offer oblations to the demigod Aryama or to Lord
Visnu. From time immemorial in India the son of a dead man goes to Gaya and, at a Visnu temple there,
offers oblations for the benefit of his ghostly father. It is not that everyone's father becomes a ghost, but
the oblations of pinda are offered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu so that if a family member happens to
become a ghost, he will be favored with a gross body. However, if one is habituated to taking the prasada
of Lord Visnu, there is no chance of his becoming a ghost or anything lower than a human being. In Vedic
civilization there is a performance called sraddha by which food is offered with faith and devotion. If one
offers oblations with faith and devotion--either to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu or to His representative in
Pitrloka, Aryama--one's forefathers will attain material bodies to enjoy whatever material enjoyment is
due them. In other words, they do not have to become ghosts.
