adhyatma-paroksyam idam
mayadhigatam adbhutam
evam striyasramah pumsas
chinno 'mutra ca samsayah
SYNONYMS
adhyatma--spiritual; paroksyam--described by authority; idam--this; maya--by me; adhigatam--heard;
adbhutam--wonderful; evam--thus; striya--with a wife; asramah--shelter; pumsah--of the living entity;
chinnah--finished; amutra--about life after death; ca--also; samsayah--doubt.
TRANSLATION
The allegory of King Puranjana, described herein according to authority, was heard by me from my
spiritual master, and it is full of spiritual knowledge. If one can understand the purpose of this allegory,
he will certainly be relieved from the bodily conception and will clearly understand life after death.
Although one may not understand what transmigration of the soul actually is, one can fully understand it
by studying this narration.
PURPORT
The word striya, meaning "along with the wife," is significant. The male and female living together
constitute the sum and substance of material existence. The attraction between male and female in this
material world is very strong. In all species of life the attraction between male and female is the basic
principle of existence. The same principle of intermingling is also in human society, but is in a regulative
form. Material existence means living together as male and female and being attracted by one another.
However, when one fully understands spiritual life, his attraction for the opposite sex is completely
vanquished. By such attraction, one becomes overly attached to this material world. It is a hard knot
within the heart.
pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam
tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho 'yam aham mameti
(Bhag. 5.5.8)
Everyone comes to this material world attracted to sense gratification, and the hard knot of sense
gratification is the attraction between male and female. By this attraction, one becomes overly attached to
the material world in terms of grha-ksetra-suta-apta-vitta--that is, home, land, children, friends, money
and so forth. Thus one becomes entangled in the bodily conception of "I" and "mine." However, if one
understands the story of King Puranjana and understands how, by sexual attraction, Puranjana became a
female in his next life, one will also understand the process of transmigration.
SPECIAL NOTE: According to Vijayadhvaja Tirtha, who belongs to the Madhvacarya-sampradaya, the
first two of the following verses appear after verse 45 of this chapter, and the remaining two verses appear
after verse 79.
TEXTS 1a-2a
sarvesam eva jantunam
satatam deha-posane
asti prajna samayatta
ko visesas tada nrnam
labdhvehante manusyatvam
hitva dehady-asad-graham
atma-srtya vihayedam
jivatma sa visisyate
SYNONYMS
sarvesam--all; eva--certainly; jantunam--of animals; satatam--always; deha-posane--to maintain the
body; asti--there is; prajna--intelligence; samayatta--resting on; kah--what; visesah--difference; tada--then;
nrnam--of the human beings; labdhva--having attained; iha--here; ante--at the end of many births;
manusyatvam--a human life; hitva--after giving up; deha-adi--in the gross and subtle body; asat-graham--
an incorrect conception of life; atma--of spiritual knowledge; srtya--by the path; vihaya--having
abandoned; idam--this body; jiva-atma--the individual spirit soul; sah--that; visisyate--becomes
prominent.
TRANSLATION
A desire to maintain body, wife and children is also observed in animal society. The animals have full
intelligence to manage such affairs. If a human being is simply advanced in this respect, what is the
difference between him and an animal? One should be very careful to understand that this human life is
attained after many, many births in the evolutionary process. A learned man who gives up the bodily
conception of life, both gross and subtle, will, by the enlightenment of spiritual knowledge, become a
prominent individual spirit soul, as the Supreme Lord is also.
PURPORT
It is said that man is a rational animal, but from this verse we can also understand that rationality exists
even in animal life. Unless there is rationality, how can an animal maintain its body by working so hard?
That the animals are not rational is untrue; their rationality, however, is not very advanced. In any case,
we cannot deny them rationality. The point is that one should use one's reason to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for that is the perfection of human life.
