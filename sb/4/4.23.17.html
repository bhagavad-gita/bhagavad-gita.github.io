the senses; yatha-udbhavam--wherefrom they generated; bhuta-adina--by the five elements; amuni--all
those sense objects; utkrsya--taking out; mahati--in the mahat-tattva; atmani--unto the ego; sandadhe--
amalgamated.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He amalgamated the mind with the senses and the senses with the sense objects, according to their
respective positions, and he also amalgamated the material ego with the total material energy, mahattattva.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In respect to the ego, the total material energy is sundered in two parts--one agitated by the mode of
ignorance and the other agitated by the modes of passion and goodness. Due to agitation by the mode of
ignorance, the five gross elements are created. Due to agitation by the mode of passion, the mind is
created, and due to agitation by the mode of goodness, false egoism, or identification with matter, is
created. The mind is protected by a particular type of demigod. Sometimes the mind (manah) is also
understood to have a controlling deity or demigod. In this way the total mind, namely the material mind
controlled by material demigods, was amalgamated with the senses. The senses, in turn, were
amalgamated with the sense objects. The sense objects are forms, tastes, smells, sounds, etc. Sound is the
ultimate source of the sense objects. The mind was attracted by the senses and the senses by the sense
objects, and all of them were ultimately amalgamated in the sky. The creation is so arranged that cause
and effect follow one after the other. The merging process involves amalgamating the effect with the
original cause. Since the ultimate cause in the material world is mahat-tattva, everything was gradually
wound up and amalgamated with the mahat-tattva. This may be compared to sunya-vada, or voidism, but
this is the process for cleansing the real spiritual mind, or consciousness.
When the mind is completely washed of all material contamination, the pure consciousness acts. The
sound vibration from the spiritual sky can automatically cleanse all material contaminations, as confirmed
by Caitanya Mahaprabhu: ceto-darpana-marjanam. We need only take the advice of Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu and chant the Hare Krsna mantra to cleanse the mind of all material contamination, and this
may be considered the summary of this difficult verse. As soon as the whole material contamination is
washed away by this process of chanting, all desires and reactions to material activities become
immediately vanquished, and real life, peaceful existence, begins. In this age of Kali it is very difficult to
adopt the yogic process mentioned in this verse. Unless one is very expert in such yoga, the best course is
to adopt the ways and means of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, sri-krsna-sankirtanam. Thus one can
gloriously become freed from all material contamination by the simple process of chanting Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. Just as life in this
material world has its beginning in material sound, similarly a spiritual life has its beginning in this
spiritual sound vibration.
