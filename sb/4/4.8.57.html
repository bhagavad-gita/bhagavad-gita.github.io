<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Dhruva, besides worshiping the Deity and chanting the mantra three times a day, you should
meditate upon the transcendental activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different
incarnations, as exhibited by His supreme will and personal potencies.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devotional service comprises nine prescribed practices--hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping,
serving, offering everything to the Deity, etc. Here Dhruva Maharaja is advised not only to meditate on the
form of the Lord, but to think of His transcendental pastimes in His different incarnations. Mayavadi
philosophers take the incarnation of the Lord to be in the same category as the ordinary living entity. This
is a great mistake. The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not forced to act by the
material laws of nature. The word sveccha is used here to indicate that He appears out of His supreme
will. The conditioned soul is forced to accept a particular type of body according to his karma given by
the laws of material nature under the direction of the Supreme Lord. But when the Lord appears, He is not
forced by the dictation of material nature; He appears as He likes by His own internal potency. That is the
difference. The conditioned soul accepts a particular type of body, such as the body of a hog, by his work
and by the superior authority of material nature. But when Lord Krsna appears in the incarnation of a
boar, He is not the same kind of hog as an ordinary animal. Krsna appears as Varaha-avatara in an
expansive feature which cannot be compared to an ordinary hog's. His appearance and disappearance are
inconceivable to us. In the Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that He appears by His own internal potency for
the protection of the devotees and the annihilation of the nondevotees. A devotee should always consider
that Krsna does not appear as an ordinary human being or ordinary beast; His appearance as Varaha-murti
or a horse or tortoise is an exhibition of His internal potency. In the Brahma-samhita it is said, anandacinmaya-
rasa-pratibhavitabhih: one should not mistake the appearance of the Lord as a human being or a
beast to be the same as the birth of an ordinary conditioned soul, who is forced to appear by the laws of
nature, whether as an animal, as a human being or as a demigod. This kind of thinking is offensive. Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has condemned the Mayavadis as offensive to the Supreme Personality of Godhead
because of their thinking that the Lord and the conditioned living entities are one and the same.
Narada advises Dhruva to meditate on the pastimes of the Lord, which is as good as the meditation of
concentrating one's mind on the form of the Lord. As meditation on any form of the Lord is valuable, so is
chanting of different names of the Lord, such as Hari, Govinda and Narayana. But in this age we are
especially advised to chant the Hare Krsna mantra as enunciated in the sastra: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
