<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, due to Your illusory energy, all living beings in this material world have forgotten their real
constitutional position, and out of ignorance they are always desirous of material happiness in the form of
society, friendship and love. Therefore, please do not ask me to take some material benefits from You, but
as a father, not waiting for the son's demand, does everything for the benefit of the son, please bestow
upon me whatever You think best for me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is the duty of the son to depend upon his father without asking anything from him. The good son has
faith that the father knows best how to benefit him. Similarly, a pure devotee does not ask anything from
the Lord for material benefit. Nor does he ask anything for spiritual benefit. The pure devotee is fully
surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord takes charge of him, as stated in Bhagavad-gita
(18.66): aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami. The father knows the necessities of the son and
supplies them, and the Supreme Lord knows the necessities of the living entities and supplies them
sumptuously. Therefore the Isopanisad states that everything in this material world is complete (purnam
idam). The difficulty is that due to forgetfulness the living entities create unnecessary demands and
entangle themselves in material activities. The result is that there is no end to material activities, life after
life.
Before us there are varieties of living entities, and everyone is entangled in transmigrations and
activities. Our duty is simply to surrender unto the Supreme personality of Godhead and let Him take
charge, for He knows what is good for us.
Prthu Maharaja therefore tells the Lord that, as the supreme father, He may elect to bestow whatever He
considers beneficial for Prthu Maharaja. That is the perfect position of the living entity. Therefore Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu teaches us in His Siksastaka:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi
"O Almighty Lord! I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor have I any desire to enjoy beautiful
women, nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotional service in my life,
birth after birth."
The conclusion is that the pure devotee should not aspire after any material benefit from devotional
service, nor should he be enamored by fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. He should always
be engaged favorably in the service of the Lord. That is the highest perfection of life.
