<h2>Text</h2>
tat praja bhartr-pindartham
svartham evanasuyavah
kurutadhoksaja-dhiyas
tarhi me 'nugrahah krtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; prajah--my dear citizens; bhartr--of the master; pinda-artham--welfare after death; svaartham--
own interest; eva--certainly; anasuyavah--without being envious; kuruta--just execute;
adhoksaja--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; dhiyah--thinking of Him; tarhi--therefore; me--unto me;
anugrahah--mercy; krtah--being done.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prthu Maharaja continued: Therefore, my dear citizens, for the welfare of your king after his death, you
should execute your duties properly in terms of your positions of varna and asrama and should always
think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within your hearts. By doing so, you will protect your own
interests, and you will bestow mercy upon your king for his welfare after death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words adhoksaja-dhiyah, meaning "Krsna consciousness," are very important in this verse. The
king and citizens should both be Krsna conscious, otherwise both of them will be doomed to lower
species of life after death. A responsible government must teach Krsna consciousness very vigorously for
the benefit of all. Without Krsna consciousness, neither the state nor the citizens of the state can be
responsible. Prthu Maharaja therefore specifically requested the citizens to act in Krsna consciousness,
and he was also very anxious to teach them how to become Krsna conscious. A summary of Krsna
consciousness is given in Bhagavad-gita (9.27):
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you give in charity and whatever penances you undergo
should be done in Krsna consciousness, or for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." If
all the people of the state, including the government servants, are taught the techniques of spiritual life,
then although everyone is liable to be punished in different ways by the stringent laws of material nature,
they will not be implicated.
