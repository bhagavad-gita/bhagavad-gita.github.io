<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
sa tan prsatkair abhidhavato mrdhe
nikrtta-bahuru-sirodharodaran
ninaya lokam param arka-mandalam
vrajanti nirbhidya yam urdhva-retasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Dhruva Maharaja); tan--all the Yaksas; prsatkaih--by his arrows; abhidhavatah--coming
forward; mrdhe--in the battlefield; nikrtta--being separated; bahu--arms; uru--thighs; sirah-dhara--necks;
udaran--and bellies; ninaya--delivered; lokam--to the planet; param--supreme; arka-mandalam--the sun
globe; vrajanti--go; nirbhidya--piercing; yam--to which; urdhva-retasah--those who do not discharge
semen at any time.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja saw the Yaksas coming forward, he immediately took his arrows and cut the
enemies to pieces. Separating their arms, legs, heads and bellies from their bodies, he delivered the Yaksas
to the planetary system which is situated above the sun globe and which is attainable only by first-class
brahmacaris, who have never discharged their semen.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To be killed by the Lord or by His devotees is auspicious for nondevotees. The Yaksas were killed
indiscriminately by Dhruva Maharaja, but they attained the planetary system attainable only for
brahmacaris who never discharged their semen. As the impersonalist jnanis or the demons killed by the
Lord attain Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, persons killed by a devotee of the Lord also attain Satyaloka. To
reach the Satyaloka planetary system described here, one has to be elevated above the sun globe. Killing,
therefore, is not always bad. If the killing is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee
or in great sacrifices, it is for the benefit of the entity killed in that way. Material so-called nonviolence is
very insignificant in comparison to killing done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees.
Even when a king or the state government kills a person who is a murderer, that killing is for the benefit
of the murderer, for thus he may become cleared of all sinful reactions.
An important word in this verse is urdhva-retasah, which means brahmacaris who have never
discharged semen. Celibacy is so important that even though one does not undergo any austerities,
penances or ritualistic ceremonies prescribed in the Vedas, if one simply keeps himself a pure brahmacari,
not discharging his semen, the result is that after death he goes to the Satyaloka. Generally, sex life is the
cause of all miseries in the material world. In the Vedic civilization sex life is restricted in various ways.
Out of the whole population of the social structure, only the grhasthas are allowed restricted sex life. All
others refrain from sex. The people of this age especially do not know the value of not discharging semen.
As such, they are variously entangled with material qualities and suffer an existence of struggle only. The
word urdhva-retasah especially indicates the Mayavadi sannyasis, who undergo strict principles of
austerity. But in the Bhagavad-gita (8.16) the Lord says that even if one goes up to Brahmaloka, he again
comes back (abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna). Therefore, actual mukti, or liberation, can
be attained only by devotional service, because by devotional service one can go above Brahmaloka, or to
the spiritual world, wherefrom he never comes back. Mayavadi sannyasis are very proud of becoming
liberated, but actual liberation is not possible unless one is in touch with the Supreme Lord in devotional
service. It is said, harim vina na srtim taranti: without Krsna's mercy, no one can have liberation.
