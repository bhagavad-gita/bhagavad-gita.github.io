<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who have completely taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord should recite this narration of
Dhruva Maharaja without taking remuneration. Specifically, recitation is recommended on the full moon
or dark moon day, on the day after Ekadasi, on the appearance of the Sravana star, at the end of a
particular tithi, or the occasion of Vyatipata, at the end of the month, or on Sunday. Such recitation
should of course be performed before a favorable audience. When recitation is performed this way,
without professional motive, the reciter and audience become perfect.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Professional reciters may ask money to extinguish the blazing fire within their bellies, but they cannot
make any spiritual improvement or become perfect. It is therefore strictly forbidden to recite Srimad-
Bhagavatam as a profession to earn a livelihood. Only one who is completely surrendered at the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, depending fully on Him for personal maintenance or even for
maintenance of his family, can attain perfection by recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is full of
narrations of the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees. The process can be summarized as follows: the
audience must be faithfully receptive to the Bhagavata message, and the reciter should completely depend
on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavata recitation must not be a business. If done in the right
way, not only does the reciter achieve perfect satisfaction, but the Lord also is very satisfied with the
reciter and the audience, and thus both are liberated from material bondage simply by the process of
hearing.
