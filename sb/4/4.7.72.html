<h2>Translation</h2>
For the first month Dhruva Maharaja ate only fruits and berries on every third day, only to keep his
body and soul together, and in this way he progressed in his worship of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kapittha is a flower which is known in Indian vernacular as kayeta. We do not find an English
equivalent for the name of this flower, but its fruit is generally not accepted by human beings; it is eaten
by monkeys in the forest. Dhruva Maharaja, however, accepted such fruits, not for luxurious feasting but
just to keep his body and soul together. The body needs food, but a devotee should not accept foodstuff to
satisfy the tongue in sense gratification. It is recommended in Bhagavad-gita that one should accept as
much food as necessary to keep the body fit, but one should not eat for luxury. Dhruva Maharaja is an
acarya, and by undergoing severe austerities and penances he teaches us how one should execute
devotional service. We must carefully know the process of Dhruva Maharaja's service; how severely he
passed his days will be shown in later verses. We should always remember that to become a bona fide
devotee of the Lord is not an easy task, but in this age, by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, it has been made
very easy. But if we do not follow even the liberal instructions of Lord Caitanya, how can we expect to
discharge our regular duties in devotional service? lt is not possible in this age to follow Dhruva Maharaja
in his austerity, but the principles must be followed; we should not disregard the regulative principles
given by our spiritual master, for they make it easier for the conditioned soul. As far as our ISKCON
movement is concerned, we simply ask that one observe the four prohibitive rules, chant sixteen rounds
and, instead of indulging in luxurious eating for the tongue, simply accept prasada offered to the Lord.
This does not mean that with our fasting the Lord should also fast. The Lord should be given foodstuff
which is as nice as possible. But we should not make it a point to satisfy our own tongues. As far as
possible we should accept simple foodstuff, just to keep the body and soul together to execute devotional
service.
It is our duty to remember always that in comparison to Dhruva Maharaja we are insignificant. We
cannot do anything like what Dhruva Maharaja did for self-realization because we are absolutely
incompetent to execute such service. But by Lord Caitanya's mercy we have been given all concessions
possible for this age, so at least we should always remember that neglect of our prescribed duties in
devotional service will not make us successful in the mission we have undertaken. It is our duty to follow
in the footsteps of Dhruva Maharaja, for he was very determined. We should also be determined to finish
our duties in executing devotional service in this life; we should not wait for another life to finish our job.
