<h2>Translation</h2>
At the end of ten thousand years of severe austerities performed by the Pracetas, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, to reward their austerities, appeared before them in His very pleasing form. This
appealed to the Pracetas and satisfied the labor of their austerities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Performing ten thousand years of severe austerities does not seem a happy endeavor. Yet the devotees,
the serious students of spiritual life, undergo such austerities to attain the favor of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. At that time, when the duration of life was very long, people could undergo
severe austerities for thousands of years. It is said that Valmiki, the author of Ramayana, underwent
meditational austerities for sixty thousand years. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciated the
austerities undergone by the Pracetas, and He finally appeared before them in a pleasing form. Thus they
all became satisfied and forgot the austerities they underwent. In the material world, if one is successful
after hard labor, he is very pleased. Similarly, the devotee forgets all his labors and austerities as soon as
he contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Dhruva Maharaja was only a five-year-old boy,
he underwent severe austerities by eating simply dry foliage, drinking only water and taking no food. In
this way, after six months, he was able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. When he
saw the Lord, he forgot all his austerities and said, svamin krtartho'smi: "My dear Lord, I am very
pleased."
Of course, these austerities were performed in the Satya-yuga, Dvapara-yuga and Treta-yuga, but not in
this age of Kali. In this Kali-yuga, one can attain the same results simply by chanting the Hare Krsna
maha-mantra. Because the people of this age are fallen, the Lord is kind enough to give them the easiest
method. Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, one can attain the same results. However, as Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu points out, we are so unfortunate that we are not even attracted to chanting the
maha-mantra--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare.
