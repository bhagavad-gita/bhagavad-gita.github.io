<h2>Translation</h2>
The great saint Maitreya continued: After that, the Pracetas lived at home for thousands of years and
developed perfect knowledge in spiritual consciousness. At last they remembered the blessings of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and left home, putting their wife in charge of a perfect son.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After the Pracetas had finished their penances, they were blessed by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Lord blessed them by telling them that after finishing their family life they would return
home, back to Godhead, in due course of time. After finishing their family life, which lasted thousands of
years according to the calculations of the demigods, the Pracetas decided to leave home, putting their wife
in the charge of a son named Daksa. This is the process of Vedic civilization. In the beginning of life, as a
brahmacari, one has to undergo severe penances and austerities in order to be educated in spiritual values.
The brahmacari, or student, is never allowed to mingle with women and learn from the beginning of life
about sex enjoyment. The basic flaw in modern civilization is that boys and girls are given freedom during
school and college to enjoy sex life. Most of the children are varna-sankara, meaning "born of undesirable
fathers and mothers." Consequently, the whole world is in chaos. Actually, human civilization should be
based on the Vedic principles. This means that in the beginning of life boys and girls should undergo
penances and austerities. When they are grown, they should get married, live for some time at home and
beget children. When the children are grown up, the man should leave home and search for Krsna
consciousness. In this way one can make one's life perfect by going home to the kingdom of God.
Unless one practices penances and austerities in his student life, he cannot understand the existence of
God. Without realizing Krsna, one cannot make his life perfect. The conclusion is that when the children
are grown, the wife should be put in the children's charge. The husband may then leave home to develop
Krsna consciousness. Everything depends on the development of mature knowledge. King
Pracinabarhisat, the father of the Pracetas, left home before the arrival of his sons, who were engaged in
austerity within the water. As soon as the time is ripe, or as soon as one has developed perfect Krsna
consciousness, he should leave home, even though all his duties may not be fulfilled. Pracinabarhisat was
waiting for the arrival of his sons, but following the instructions of Narada, as soon as his intelligence was
properly developed, he simply left instructions for his ministers to impart to his sons. Thus without
waiting for their arrival, he left home.
Giving up a comfortable home life is absolutely necessary for human beings and is advised by Prahlada
Maharaja. Hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam: to finish the materialistic way of life, one should leave
his so-called comfortable home life, which is simply a means for killing the soul (atma-patam). The home
is considered to be a dark well covered by grass, and if one falls within this well, he simply dies without
anyone's caring. One should therefore not be too much attached to family life, for it will spoil one's
development of Krsna consciousness.
