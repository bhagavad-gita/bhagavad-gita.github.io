<h2>Text</h2>

pataye yajna-retase
trpti-daya ca jivanam

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

the demigods; trayyah--of the three Vedas; pataye--unto the master; yajna--sacrifices; retase--unto the

also; jivanam--of the living entities; namah--I offer my obeisances; sarva-rasa-atmane--unto the allpervading

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are the provider of the Pitrlokas as well as all the demigods. You are the predominating
deity of the moon and the master of all three Vedas. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because
You are the original source of satisfaction for all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the living entity is born with this material world--especially as a human being--he has several
obligations unto the demigods, unto the saintly persons and unto living entities in general. As enjoined in
the sastras: devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam. Thus one has an obligation to one's forefathers, the previous
hierarchy. Lord Siva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so he can become free from all
obligation to the Pitas, demigods, general living entities and saintly persons and completely engage
himself in the devotional service of the Lord. As stated:
devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam
na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan
sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam
gato mukundam parihrtya kartam
(Bhag. 11.5.41)
One becomes free from all obligations to the demigods, saintly persons, pitas, ancient forefathers, etc., if
one is completely engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Lord Siva therefore prays to Lord
Aniruddha to give him strength so that he can be free from such obligations and entirely engage in the
Lord s service.
Soma, or the predominating deity of the moon, is responsible for the living entity's ability to relish the
taste of food through the tongue. Lord Siva prays to Lord Aniruddha to give him strength so that he will
not taste anything but the prasada of the Lord. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung a verse indicating
that the tongue is the most formidable enemy among all the senses. If one can control the tongue, he can
easily control the other senses. The tongue can be controlled only by eating prasada offered to the Deity.
Lord Siva's prayer to Lord Aniruddha is meant for this purpose (trpti-daya); he prays to Lord Aniruddha
to help him be satisfied by eating only prasada offered to the Lord.
