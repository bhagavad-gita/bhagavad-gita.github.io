<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage Maitreya said: When such cursing and countercursing was going on between Lord Siva's
followers and the parties of Daksa and Bhrgu, Lord Siva became very morose. Not saying anything, he left
the arena of the sacrifice, followed by his disciples.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here Lord Siva's excellent character is described. In spite of the cursing and countercursing between the
parties of Daksa and Siva, because he is the greatest Vaisnava he was so sober that he did not say
anything. A Vaisnava is always tolerant, and Lord Siva is considered the topmost Vaisnava, so his
character, as shown in this scene, is excellent. He became morose because he knew that these people, both
his men and Daksa's, were unnecessarily cursing and countercursing one another, without any interest in
spiritual life. From his point of view, he did not see anyone as lower or higher, because he is a Vaisnava.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.18), panditah sama-darsinah: one who is perfectly learned does not see
anyone as lesser or greater, because he sees everyone from the spiritual platform. Thus the only alternative
left to Lord Siva was to leave in order to stop his follower, Nandisvara, as well as Bhrgu Muni, from
cursing and countercursing in that way.
