<h2>Text</h2>
tvam karmanam mangala mangalanam
kartuh sva-lokam tanuse svah param va
amangalanam ca tamisram ulbanam
viparyayah kena tad eva kasyacit
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvam--Your Lordship; karmanam--of the prescribed duties; mangala--O most auspicious; mangalanam--
of the auspicious; kartuh--of the performer; sva-lokam--respective higher planetary systems; tanuse--
expand; svah--heavenly planets; param--transcendental world; va--or; amangalanam--of the inauspicious;
ca--and; tamisram--the name of a particular hell; ulbanam--ghastly; viparyayah--the opposite; kena--why;
tat eva--certainly that; kasyacit--for someone.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O most auspicious lord, you have ordained the heavenly planets, the spiritual Vaikuntha planets and the
impersonal Brahman sphere as the respective destinations of the performers of auspicious activities.
Similarly, for others, who are miscreants, you have destined different kinds of hells which are horrible and
ghastly. Yet sometimes it is found that their destinations are just the opposite. It is very difficult to
ascertain the cause of this.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is called the supreme will. It is by the supreme will that
everything is happening. It is said, therefore, that not a blade of grass moves without the supreme will.
Generally it is prescribed that performers of pious activities are promoted to the higher planetary systems,
devotees are promoted to the Vaikunthas, or spiritual worlds, and impersonal speculators are promoted to
the impersonal Brahman effulgence; but it sometimes so happens that a miscreant like Ajamila is
immediately promoted to the Vaikunthaloka simply by chanting the name of Narayana. Although when
Ajamila uttered this vibration he intended to call his son Narayana, Lord Narayana took it seriously and
immediately gave him promotion to Vaikunthaloka, despite his background, which was full of sinful
activities. Similarly King Daksa was always engaged in the pious activities of performing sacrifices, yet
simply because of creating a little misunderstanding with Lord Siva, he was severely taken to task. The
conclusion is, therefore, that the supreme will is the ultimate judgment; no one can argue upon this. A
pure devotee therefore submits in all circumstances to the supreme will of the Lord, accepting it as allauspicious.
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
(Bhag. 10.14.8)
The purport of this verse is that when a devotee is in a calamitous condition he takes it as a benediction
of the Supreme Lord and takes responsibility himself for his past misdeeds. In such a condition, he offers
still more devotional service and is not disturbed. One who lives in such a disposition of mind, engaged in
devotional service, is the most eligible candidate for promotion to the spiritual world. In other words,
such a devotee's claim for promotion to the spiritual world is assured in all circumstances.
