<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tasya vamsyas tu naisada
giri-kanana-gocarah
yenaharaj jayamano
vena-kalmasam ulbanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--his (Nisada's); vamsyah--descendants; tu--then; naisadah--called Naisadas; giri-kanana--the hills
and forests; gocarah--inhabiting; yena--because; aharat--he took upon himself; jayamanah--being born;
vena--of King Vena; kalmasam--all kinds of sin; ulbanam--very fearful.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After his [Nisada's] birth, he immediately took charge of all the resultant actions of King Vena's sinful
activities. As such, this Naisada class are always engaged in sinful activities like stealing, plundering and
hunting. Consequently they are only allowed to live in the hills and forests.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Naisadas are not allowed to live in cities and towns because they are sinful by nature. As such, their
bodies are very ugly, and their occupations are also sinful. We should, however, know that even these
sinful men (who are sometimes called Kiratas) can be delivered from their sinful condition to the topmost
Vaisnava platform by the mercy of a pure devotee. Engagement in the transcendental loving devotional
service of the Lord can make anyone, however sinful he may be, fit to return home, back to Godhead. One
has only to become free from all contamination by the process of devotional service. In this way everyone
can become fit to return home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita
(9.32):
mam hi partha vyapasritya
ye 'pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sudras
te 'pi yanti param gatim
"O son of Prtha, those who take shelter of Me, though they be of lower birth--women, vaisyas
[merchants], as well as sudras [workers]--can approach the supreme destination."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Story of King Vena."
Chapter Fifteen
King Prthu's Appearance and Coronation
King Prthu' s Appearance and Coronation
