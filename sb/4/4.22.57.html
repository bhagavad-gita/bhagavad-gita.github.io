<h2>Text</h2>
durdharsas tejasevagnir
mahendra iva durjayah
titiksaya dharitriva
dyaur ivabhista-do nrnam
<br>

iva--likened; durjayah--insuperable; titiksaya--by tolerance; dharitri--the earth; iva--like; dyauh--the
heavenly planets; iva--like; abhista-dah--fulfilling desires; nrnam--of human society.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Prthu was so strong and powerful that no one could disobey his orders any more than one
could conquer fire itself. He was so strong that he was compared to Indra, the King of heaven, whose
power is insuperable. On the other hand, Maharaja Prthu was also as tolerant as the earth, and in fulfilling
various desires of human society, he was like heaven itself.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is the duty of a king to give protection to the citizens and to fulfill their desires. At the same time, the
citizens must obey the laws of the state. Maharaja Prthu maintained all the standards of good government,
and he was so invincible that no one could disobey his orders any more than a person could stop heat and
light emanating from a fire. He was so strong and powerful that he was compared to the King of heaven,
Indra. In this age modern scientists have been experimenting with nuclear weapons, and in a former age
they used to release brahmastras, but all these brahmastras and nuclear weapons are insignificant
compared to the thunderbolt of the King of heaven. When Indra releases a thunderbolt, even the biggest
hills and mountains crack. On the other hand, Maharaja Prthu was as tolerant as the earth itself, and he
fulfilled all the desires of his citizens just like torrents of rain from the sky. Without rainfall, it is not
possible to fulfill one's various desires on this planet. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.14), parjanyad annasambhavah:
food grains are produced only because rain falls from the sky, and without grains, no one on
the earth can be satisfied. Consequently an unlimited distribution of mercy is compared to the water
falling from the clouds. Maharaja Prthu distributed his mercy incessantly, much like rainfall. In other
words, Maharaja Prthu was softer than a rose flower and harder than a thunderbolt. In this way he ruled
over his kingdom.
