<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tan atisthati yah samyag
upayan purva-darsitan
avarah sraddhayopeta
upeyan vindate 'njasa
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan--those; atisthati--follows; yah--anyone who; samyak--completely; upayan--principles; purva--
formerly; darsitan--instructed; avarah--inexperienced; sraddhaya--with faith; upetah--being situated;
upeyan--the fruits of activities; vindate--enjoys; anjasa--very easily.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who follows the principles and instructions enjoined by the great sages of the past can utilize these
instructions for practical purposes. Such a person can very easily enjoy life and pleasures.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic principles (mahajano yena gatah sa panthah) urge us to follow in the footsteps of great
liberated souls. In this way we can receive benefit in both this life and the next, and we can also improve
our material life. By following the principles laid down by great sages and saints of the past, we can very
easily understand the aim of all life. The word avarah, meaning "inexperienced," is very significant in this
verse. Every conditioned soul is inexperienced. Everyone is abodha jata--born a fool and rascal. In
democratic government at the present moment all kinds of fools and rascals are making decisions. But
what can they do? What is the result of their legislation? They enact something today just to whimsically
repeal it tomorrow. One political party utilizes a country for one purpose, and the next moment another
political party forms a different type of government and nullifies all the laws and regulations. This process
of chewing the chewed (punah punas carvita-carvananam) will never make human society happy. In
order to make all human society happy and prosperous, we should accept the standard methods given by
liberated persons.
