<h2>Translation</h2>
Although abominable persons like my father, Vena, the grandson of death personified, are bewildered
on the path of religion, all the great personalities like those mentioned agree that in this world the only
bestower of the benedictions of religion, economic development, sense gratification, liberation or
elevation to the heavenly planets is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Vena, the father of Prthu Maharaja, was condemned by the brahmanas and saintly persons because
of his denying the existence of the Supreme personality of Godhead and rejecting the method of satisfying
Him by performance of Vedic sacrifice. In other words, he was an atheist, who did not believe in the
existence of God, and who consequently stopped all Vedic ritualistic ceremonies in his kingdom. Prthu
Maharaja considered King Vena's character abominable because Vena was foolish regarding the execution
of religious performances. Atheists are of the opinion that there is no need to accept the authority of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead to be successful in religion, economic development, sense gratification
or liberation. According to them, dharma, or religious principles, are meant to establish an imaginary God
to encourage one to become moral, honest and just so that the social orders may be maintained in peace
and tranquillity. Furthermore, they say that actually there is no need to accept God for this purpose, for if
one follows the principles of morality and honesty, that is sufficient. Similarly, if one makes nice plans
and works very hard for economic development, automatically the result of economic development will
come. Similarly, sense gratification also does not depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, for if one earns enough money by any process, one will have sufficient opportunity for sense
gratification. Insofar as liberation is concerned, they say that there is no need to talk of liberation because
after death everything is finished. Prthu Maharaja, however, did not accept the authority of such atheists,
headed by his father, who was the grandson of death personified. Generally, a daughter inherits the
qualities of her father, and a son gets the qualities of his mother. Thus Mrtyu's daughter, Sunitha, got all
the qualities of her father, and Vena inherited the qualities of his mother. A person who is always
subjected to the rules and regulations of repeated birth and death cannot accommodate anything beyond
materialistic ideas. Since King Vena was such a man, he did not believe in the existence of God. Modern
civilization agrees with the principles of King Vena, but factually if we scrutinizingly study all the
conditions of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, we must accept the
principles of the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Vedic literature, religion
consists only of the codes of law given by God.
If one does not accept the authority of the Supreme Godhead in matters of religion and morality, one
must explain why two persons of the same moral standard achieve different results. It is generally found
that even if two men have the same moral standards of ethics, honesty and morality, their positions are
still not the same. Similarly, in economic development it is seen that if two men work very hard day and
night, still the results are not the same. One person may enjoy great opulence without even working,
whereas another person, although working very hard, does not even get two sufficient meals a day.
Similarly, in the matter of sense gratification, sometimes one who has sufficient food is still not happy in
his family affairs or sometimes is not even married, whereas another person, even though not
economically well off, has the greatest opportunity for sense gratification. Even an animal like a hog or a
dog may have greater opportunities for sense gratification than a human being. Aside from liberation,
even if we consider only the preliminary necessities of life--dharma, artha and kama (religion, economic
development and sense gratification)--we will see that they are not the same for everyone. Therefore it
must be accepted that there is someone who determines the different standards. In conclusion, not only
for liberation must one depend on the Lord, but even for ordinary necessities in this material world. Prthu
Maharaja therefore indicated that in spite of having rich parents, children are sometimes not happy.
Similarly, in spite of valuable medicine administered by a competent physician, sometimes a patient dies;
or in spite of having a big safe boat, sometimes a man drowns. We may thus struggle to counteract
impediments offered by material nature, but our attempts cannot be successful unless we are favored by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
