<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, what You have said to Your unalloyed devotee is certainly very much bewildering. The
allurements You offer in the Vedas are certainly not suitable for pure devotees. People in general, bound
by the sweet words of the Vedas, engage themselves again and again in fruitive activities, enamored by the
results of their actions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura, a great acarya of the Gaudiya-sampradaya, has said that persons who are
very much attached to the fruitive activities of the Vedas, namely karma-kanda and jnana-kanda, are
certainly doomed. In the Vedas there are three categories of activities, known as karma-kanda (fruitive
activities), jnana-kanda (philosophical research) and upasana-kanda (worship of different demigods for
receiving material benefits). Those who are engaged in karma-kanda and jnana-kanda are doomed in the
sense that everyone is doomed who is entrapped by this material body, whether it is a body of a demigod,
a king, a lower animal or whatever. The sufferings of the threefold miseries of material nature are the
same for all. Cultivation of knowledge to understand one's spiritual position is also, to a certain extent, a
waste of time. Because the living entity is an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his immediate
business is to engage himself in devotional service. Prthu Maharaja therefore says that the allurement of
material benedictions is another trap to entangle one in this material world. He therefore frankly tells the
Lord that the Lord's offerings of benedictions in the form of material facilities are certainly causes for
bewilderment. A pure devotee is not at all interested in bhukti or mukti.
The Lord sometimes offers benedictions to the neophyte devotees who have not yet understood that
material facilities will not make them happy. In the Caitanya-caritamrta the Lord therefore says that a
sincere devotee who is not very intelligent may ask some material benefit from the Lord, but the Lord,
being omniscient, does not generally give material rewards but, on the contrary, takes away whatever
material facilities are being enjoyed by His devotee, so that ultimately the devotee will completely
surrender unto Him. In other words, the offering of benedictions in the form of material profit is never
auspicious for the devotee. The statements of the Vedas which offer elevation to heavenly planets in
exchange for great sacrifices are simply bewildering. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (2.42) the Lord says: yam
imam puspitam vacam pravadanty avipascitah. The less intelligent class of men (avipascitah), attracted by
the flowery language of the Vedas, engage in fruitive activities to become materially benefited. Thus they
continue life after life, in different bodily forms, to search very, very hard.
