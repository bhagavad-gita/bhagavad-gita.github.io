<h2>Text</h2>
tatrapi hamsam purusam
paramatmanam atma-drk
yajams tal-lokatam apa
kusalena samadhina
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra api--despite his engagement; hamsam--one who kills the distress of his kinsmen; purusam--unto
the Supreme Person; parama-atmanam--the most beloved Supersoul; atma-drk--one who has seen or
acquired self-realization; yajan--by worshiping; tat-lokatam--achieved the same planet; apa--achieved;
kusalena--very easily; samadhina--always keeping himself in ecstasy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although Maharaja Antardhana was engaged in performing sacrifices, because he was a self-realized
soul he very intelligently rendered devotional service to the Lord, who eradicates all the fears of His
devotees. By thus worshiping the Supreme Lord, Maharaja Antardhana, rapt in ecstasy, attained His planet
very easily.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since sacrifices are generally performed by fruitive actors, it is especially mentioned here (tatrapi) that
although Maharaja Antardhana was externally engaged in performing sacrifices, his real business was
rendering devotional service by hearing and chanting. In other words, he was performing the usual
sacrifices by the method of sankirtana-yajna, as recommended herein:
sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
(Bhag. 7.5.23)
Devotional service is called kirtana-yajna, and by practicing the sankirtana-yajna, one is very easily
elevated to the planet where the Supreme Lord resides. Out of the five kinds of liberations, achieving the
same planet where the Lord resides and living with the Lord there is called salokya liberation.
