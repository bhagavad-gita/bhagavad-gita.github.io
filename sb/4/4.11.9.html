<h2>Text</h2>
tasya pritena manasa
tam dattvaidavidas tatah
pasyato 'ntardadhe so 'pi
sva-puram pratyapadyata
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--with Dhruva; pritena--being very pleased; manasa--with such a mentality; tam--that
remembrance; dattva--having given; aidavidah--Kuvera, son of Idavida; tatah--thereafter; pasyatah--while
Dhruva was looking on; antardadhe--disappeared; sah--he (Dhruva); api--also; sva-puram--to his city;
pratyapadyata--returned.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The son of Idavida, Lord Kuvera, was very pleased, and happily he gave Dhruva Maharaja the
benediction he wanted. Thereafter he disappeared from Dhruva's presence, and Dhruva Maharaja returned
to his capital city.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kuvera, who is known as the son of Idavida, was very pleased with Dhruva Maharaja because he did not
ask him for anything materially enjoyable. Kuvera is one of the demigods, so one may put forward the
argument, "Why did Dhruva Maharaja take a benediction from a demigod?" The answer is that for a
Vaisnava there is no objection to taking a benediction from a demigod if it is favorable for advancing
Krsna consciousness. The gopis, for example, worshiped Katyayani, a demigoddess, but the only
benediction they wanted from the goddess was to have Krsna as their husband. A Vaisnava is not
interested in asking any benediction from the demigods, nor is he interested in asking benedictions from
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said in the Bhagavatam that liberation can be offered by the
Supreme Person, but even if a pure devotee is offered liberation by the Supreme Lord, he refuses to accept
it. Dhruva Maharaja did not ask Kuvera for transference to the spiritual world, which is called liberation;
he simply asked that wherever he would remain--whether in the spiritual or material world--he would
always remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A Vaisnava is always respectful to everyone. So
when Kuvera offered him a benediction, he did not refuse it. But he wanted something which would be
favorable to his advancement in Krsna consciousness.
