tatra nirbhinna-gatranam
citra-vajaih silimukhaih
viplavo 'bhud duhkhitanam
duhsahah karunatmanam
SYNONYMS
tatra--there; nirbhinna--being pierced; gatranam--whose bodies; citra-vajaih--with variegated feathers;
sili-mukhaih--by the arrows; viplavah--destruction; abhut--was done; duhkhitanam--of the most
aggrieved; duhsahah--unbearable; karuna-atmanam--for persons who are very merciful.
TRANSLATION
When King Puranjana was hunting in this way, many animals within the forest lost their lives with great
pain, being pierced by the sharp arrowheads. Upon seeing these devastating, ghastly activities performed
by the King, all the people who were merciful by nature became very unhappy. Such merciful persons
could not tolerate seeing all this killing.
PURPORT
When demoniac persons engage in animal-killing, the demigods, or devotees of the Lord, are very much
afflicted by this killing. Demoniac civilizations in this modern age maintain various types of
slaughterhouses all over the world. Rascal svamis and yogis encourage foolish persons to go on eating
flesh and killing animals and at the same time continue their so-called meditation and mystical practices.
All these affairs are ghastly, and a compassionate person, namely a devotee of the Lord, becomes very
unhappy to see such a sight. The hunting process is also carried on in a different way, as we have already
explained. Hunting women, drinking different types of liquor, becoming intoxicated, killing animals and
enjoying sex all serve as the basis of modern civilization. Vaisnavas are unhappy to see such a situation in
the world, and therefore they are very busy spreading this Krsna consciousness movement.
The devotees are pained to see the hunting and killing of animals in the forest, the wholesale slaughter
of animals in the slaughterhouses, and the exploitation of young girls in brothels that function under
different names as clubs and societies. Being very much compassionate upon the killing of animals in
sacrifice, the great sage Narada began his instructions to King Pracinabarhisat. In these instructions,
Narada Muni explained that devotees like him are very much afflicted by all the killing that goes on in
human society. Not only are saintly persons afflicted by this killing, but even God Himself is afflicted and
therefore comes down in the incarnation of Lord Buddha. Jayadeva Gosvami therefore sings: sadayahrdaya-
darsita-pasu-ghatam. Simply to stop the killing of animals, Lord Buddha compassionately
appeared. Some rascals put forward the theory that an animal has no soul or is something like dead stone.
In this way they rationalize that there is no sin in animal-killing. Actually animals are not dead stone, but
the killers of animals are stonehearted. Consequently no reason or philosophy appeals to them. They
continue keeping slaughterhouses and killing animals in the forest. The conclusion is that one who does
not care for the instructions of saintly persons like Narada and his disciplic succession surely falls into the
category of nasta-prajna and thus goes to hell.
