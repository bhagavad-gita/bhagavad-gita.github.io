<h2>Translation</h2>
Of these many sons, each produced hundreds and hundreds of grandsons. In this way the whole city of
Pancala became overcrowded by these sons and grandsons of King Puranjana.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We must remember that Puranjana is the living entity, and the city Pancala is the body. The body is the
field of activity for the living entity, as stated in Bhagavad-gita: ksetra-ksetrajna. There are two
constituents: one is the living entity (ksetra jna), and the other is the body of the living entity (ksetra).
Any living entity can know that he is covered by the body if he only contemplates the body a little bit. Just
with a little contemplation he can come to understand that the body is his possession. One can
understand this by practical experience and by the authority of the sastras. In Bhagavad-gita (2.13) it is
said: dehino'smin yatha dehe. The proprietor of the body, the soul, is within the body. The body is taken
as the pancala-desa, or the field of activities wherein the living entity can enjoy the senses in their
relationship to the five sense objects, namely gandha, rasa, rupa, sparsa and sabda--that is, sense objects
made out of earth, water, fire, air and sky. Within this material world, covered by the material body of
subtle and gross matter, every living entity creates actions and reactions, which are herein known
allegorically as sons and grandsons. There are two kinds of actions and reactions--namely pious and
impious. In this way our material existence becomes coated by different actions and reactions. In this
regard, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura states:
karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda,
amrta baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya
"Fruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison. Whoever drinks of them, thinking
them to be nectar, must struggle very hard life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all
kinds of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense enjoyment."
Thus the field of action and reactions, by which one's descendants are increased, begins with sex life.
Puranjana increased his whole family by begetting sons who in their turn begot grandsons. Thus the
living entity, being inclined toward sexual gratification, becomes involved in many hundreds and
thousands of actions and reactions. In this way he remains within the material world simply for the
purpose of sense gratification and transmigrates from one body to another. His process of reproducing so
many sons and grandsons results in so-called societies, nations, communities and so on. All these
communities, societies, dynasties and nations simply expand from sex life. As stated by Prahlada
Maharaja: yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham (Bhag. 7.9.45). A grhamedhi is one who wants
to remain within this material existence. This means that he wants to remain within this body or society
and enjoy friendship, love and community. His only enjoyment is in increasing the number of sex
enjoyers. He enjoys sex and produces children, who in their turn marry and produce grandchildren. The
grandchildren also marry and in their turn produce great-grandchildren. In this way the entire earth
becomes overpopulated, and then suddenly there are reactions provoked by material nature in the form of
war, famine, pestilence and earthquakes, etc. Thus the entire population is again extinguished simply to
be re-created. This process is explained in Bhagavad-gita (8.19) as repeated creation and annihilation:
bhutva bhutva praliyate. Due to a lack of Krsna consciousness, all this creation and annihilation is going
on under the name of human civilization. This cycle continues due to man's lack of knowledge of the soul
and the Supreme personality of Godhead.
