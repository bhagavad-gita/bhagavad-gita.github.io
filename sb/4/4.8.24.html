<h2>Text</h2>
istva mam yajna-hrdayam
yajnaih puskala-daksinaih
bhuktva cehasisah satya
ante mam samsmarisyasi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
istva--after worshiping; mam--Me; yajna-hrdayam--the heart of all sacrifices; yajnaih--by great sacrifices;
puskala-daksinaih--comprehending distribution of great charities; bhuktva--after enjoying; ca--also; iha--
within this world; asisah--blessings; satyah--true; ante--at the end; mam--Me; samsmarisyasi--you will be
able to remember.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord continued: I am the heart of all sacrifices. You will be able to perform many great sacrifices
and also give great charities. In this way you will be able to enjoy the blessings of material happiness in
this life, and at the time of your death you will be able to remember Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The most important factor in this verse is the Lord's instructions regarding how to remember the
Supreme Personality of Godhead at the end of life. Ante narayana-smrtih: the result of whatever we do in
executing spiritual activities is successful if we can remember Narayana, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This program of constant remembrance can be disturbed by many things, but Dhruva
Maharaja's life would be so pure, as assured by the Lord Himself, that Dhruva would never forget Him.
Thus at the time of his death he would remember the Supreme Lord, and before his death he would enjoy
this material world, not by sense gratification, but by performing great sacrifices. As stated in the Vedas,
when one performs great sacrifices he must give charity, not only to the brahmanas, but also to the
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras. It is assured here that Dhruva Maharaja would be able to perform such
activities. In this age of Kali, however, the great sacrifice is the performance of sankirtana-yajna. Our
Krsna consciousness movement is designed to teach people (and to learn ourselves) the exact instruction
of the Personality of Godhead. In this way we shall continuously perform the sankirtana-yajna and
continuously chant the Hare Krsna mantra. Then at the end of our lives we shall certainly be able to
remember Krsna, and our program of life will be successful. In this age, distribution of prasada has
replaced distribution of money. No one has sufficient money to distribute, but if we distribute krsnaprasada
as far as possible, this is more valuable than the distribution of money.
