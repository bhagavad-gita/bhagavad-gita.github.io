maitreya uvaca
yadabhisiktah prthur anga viprair
amantrito janatayas ca palah
praja niranne ksiti-prstha etya
ksut-ksama-dehah patim abhyavocan
SYNONYMS
maitreyah uvaca--the great sage Maitreya said; yada--when; abhisiktah--was enthroned; prthuh--King
Prthu; anga--my dear Vidura; vipraih--by the brahmanas; amantritah--was declared; janatayah--of the
people; ca--also; palah--the protector; prajah--the citizens; niranne--being without food grains; ksitiprsthe--
the surface of the globe; etya--coming near; ksut--by hunger; ksama--skinny; dehah--their bodies;
patim--to the protector; abhyavocan--they said.
TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, at the time King Prthu was enthroned by the great
sages and brahmanas and declared to be the protector of the citizens, there was a scarcity of food grains.
The citizens actually became skinny due to starvation. Therefore they came before the King and informed
him of their real situation.
PURPORT
Information is given herein concerning the selection of the king by the brahmanas. According to the
varnasrama system, the brahmanas are considered to be the heads of the society and therefore to be
situated in the topmost social position. The varnasrama-dharma, the institution of four varnas and four
asramas, is very scientifically designed. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, varnasrama-dharma is not a man-made
institution, but is God-made. In this narration it is clearly indicated that the brahmanas used to control
the royal power. When an evil king like Vena ruled, the brahmanas would kill him through their
brahminical powers and would select a proper ruler by testing his qualifications. In other words, the
brahmanas, the intelligent men or great sages, would control the monarchical powers. Here we have an
indication of how the brahmanas elected King Prthu to the throne as the protector of the citizens. The
citizens, being skinny due to hunger, approached the King and informed him that necessary action should
be taken. The structure of the varnasrama-dharma; was so nice that the brahmanas would guide the head
of state. The head of state would then give protection to the citizens. The ksatriyas would take charge of
protecting the people in general, and under the protection of the ksatriyas, the vaisyas would protect the
cows, produce food grains and distribute them. Sudras, the working class, would help the higher three
classes by manual labor. This is the perfect social system.

bestower; tvam--you; kila--indeed; loka-palah--the protector of the citizens.
TRANSLATION
Dear King, just as a tree with a fire burning in the hollow of the trunk gradually dries up, we are drying
up due to the fire of hunger in our stomachs. You are the protector of surrendered souls, and you have
been appointed to give employment to us. Therefore we have all come to you for protection. You are not
only a king, but the incarnation of God as well. Indeed, you are the king of all kings. You can give us all
kinds of occupational engagements, for you are the master of our livelihood. Therefore, O king of all
kings, please arrange to satisfy our hunger by the proper distribution of food grains. Please take care of us,
lest we soon die for want of food.
PURPORT
It is the duty of the king to see that everyone in the social orders--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--
is fully employed in the state. Just as it is the duty of the brahmanas to elect a proper king, it is the duty of
the king to see that all the varnas--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--are fully engaged in their
respective occupational duties. It is here indicated that although the people were allowed to perform their
duties, they were still unemployed. Although they were not lazy, they still could not produce sufficient
food to satisfy their hunger. When the people are perplexed in this way, they should approach the head of
government, and the president or king should take immediate action to mitigate the distress of the people.
