ije ca kratubhir ghorair
diksitah pasu-marakaih
devan pitrn bhuta-patin
nana-kamo yatha bhavan
SYNONYMS
ije--he worshiped; ca--also; kratubhih--by sacrifices; ghoraih--ghastly; diksitah--inspired; pasumarakaih--
wherein poor animals are killed; devan--the demigods; pitrn--forefathers; bhuta-patin--great
leaders of human society; nana--various; kamah--having desires; yatha--like; bhavan--you.
TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King Pracinabarhisat, like you King Puranjana also became
implicated in so many desires. Thus he worshiped demigods, forefathers and social leaders with various
sacrifices which were all very ghastly because they were inspired by the desire to kill animals.
PURPORT
In this verse the great sage Narada discloses that the character of Puranjana was being described to give
lessons to King Pracinabarhisat. Actually the entire description was figuratively describing the activities of
King Pracinabarhisat. In this verse Narada frankly says "like you" (yatha bhavan), which indicates that
King Puranjana is none other than King Pracinabarhisat himself. Being a great Vaisnava, Narada Muni
wanted to stop animal-killing in sacrifices. He knew that if he tried to stop the King from performing
sacrifices, the King would not hear him. Therefore he is describing the life of Puranjana. But in this verse
he first discloses the intention, although not fully, by saying "like you." Generally the karmis, who are
attached to increasing descendants, have to perform so many sacrifices and worship so many demigods for
future generations, as well as to satisfy so many leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists to make
things go on properly for future generations. The so-called scientists are very eager to see that future
generations will live very comfortably, and as such they are trying to find different means of generating
energy to drive locomotives, cars, airplanes and so on. Now they are exhausting the petroleum supply.
These activities are described in the Bhagavad-gita (2.41):
vyavasayatmika buddhir
ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-sakha hy anantas ca
buddhayo 'vyavasayinam
"Those who are on the spiritual path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of
the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched."
Actually, those who are in knowledge of everything are determined to execute Krsna consciousness, but
those who are rascals (mudhah), sinners (duskrtinah) and the lowest of mankind (naradhamah), who are
bereft of all intelligence (mayayapahrta jnanah) and who take shelter of the demoniac way of life (asuram
bhavam asritah), are disinterested in Krsna consciousness. As such they become implicated and take on so
many activities. Most of these activities center around the killing of animals. Modern civilization is
centered around animal-killing. Karmis are advertising that without eating meat, their vitamin value or
vitality will be reduced; so to keep oneself fit to work hard, one must eat meat, and to digest meat, one
must drink liquor, and to keep the balance of drinking wine and eating meat, one must have sufficient
sexual intercourse to keep fit to work very hard like an ass.
There are two ways of animal-killing. One way is in the name of religious sacrifices. All the religions of
the world--except the Buddhists--have a program for killing animals in places of worship. According to
Vedic civilization, the animal-eaters are recommended to sacrifice a goat in the temple of Kali under
certain restrictive rules and regulations and eat the flesh. Similarly, they are recommended to drink wine
by worshiping the goddess Candika. The purpose is restriction. People have given up all this restriction.
Now they are regularly opening wine distilleries and slaughterhouses and indulging in drinking alcohol
and eating flesh. A Vaisnava acarya like Narada Muni knows very well that persons engaged in such
animal-killing in the name of religion are certainly becoming involved in the cycle of birth and death,
forgetting the real aim of life: to go home, back to Godhead.
Thus the great sage Narada, while instructing Srimad-Bhagavatam to Vyasa Muni, condemned the
karma-kanda (fruitive) activities mentioned in the Vedas. Narada told Vyasa:
jugupsitam dharma-krte 'nusasatah
svabhava-raktasya mahan vyatikramah
yad vakyato dharma ititarah sthito
na manyate tasya nivaranam janah
"The people in general are naturally inclined to enjoy, and you have encouraged them in that way in the
name of religion. This is verily condemned and is quite unreasonable. Because they are guided under your
instructions, they will accept such activities in the name of religion and will hardly care for prohibitions."
(Bhag. 1.5.15)
Srila Narada Muni chastised Vyasadeva for compiling so many Vedic supplementary scriptures, which
are all intended for guiding the people in general. Narada Muni condemned these scriptures because they
do not mention direct devotional service. Under Narada's instructions, direct worship of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, as described in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, was set forth by Vyasadeva. The
conclusion is that neither the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, nor His devotee ever sanctions
animal-killing in the name of religion. Indeed, Krsna incarnated Himself as Lord Buddha to put an end to
animal-killing in the name of religion. Animal sacrifice under the name of religion is conducted by the
influence of tamo-guna (the mode of ignorance), as indicated in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita
(18.31-32):
yaya dharmam adharmam ca
karyam cakaryam eva ca
ayathavat prajanati
buddhih sa partha rajasi
adharmam dharmam iti ya
manyate tamasavrta
sarvarthan viparitams ca
buddhih sa partha tamasi
"That understanding which cannot distinguish between the religious way of life and the irreligious,
between action that should be done and action that should not be done--that imperfect understanding, O
son of Prtha, is in the mode of passion. That understanding which considers irreligion to be religion and
religion to be irreligion, under the spell of illusion and darkness, and strives always in the wrong
direction, O Partha, is in the mode of ignorance."
Those who are involved in the mode of ignorance manufacture religious systems for killing animals.
Actually dharma is transcendental. As Lord Sri Krsna teaches, we must give up all other systems of
religion and simply surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya). Thus the Lord and His devotees and
representatives teach the transcendental dharma, which does not allow animal-killing at all. At the present
moment it is the greatest misfortune that in India many so-called missionary workers are spreading
irreligion in the name of religion. They claim an ordinary human being to be God and recommend meateating
for everyone, including so-called sannyasis.
