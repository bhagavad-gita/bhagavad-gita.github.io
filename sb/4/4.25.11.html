so 'nvesamanah saranam
babhrama prthivim prabhuh
nanurupam yadavindad
abhut sa vimana iva
<br>

prthivim--the whole planet earth; prabhuh--to become an independent master; na--never; anurupam--to

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana began to search for a suitable place to live, and thus he traveled all over the world. Even
after a great deal of traveling, he could not find a place just to his liking. Finally he became morose and
disappointed.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The travelings of Puranjana are similar to the travelings of the modern hippies. Generally hippies are
sons of great fathers and great families. It is not that they are always poor. But some way or another they
abandon the shelter of their rich fathers and travel all over the world. As stated in this verse, the living
entity wants to become a prabhu, or master. The word prabhu means "master," but actually the living
entity is not a master; he is the eternal servant of God. When the living entity abandons the shelter of
God, Krsna, and tries to become a prabhu independently, he travels all over the creation. There are
8,400,000 species of life and millions and millions and trillions of planets within the creation. The living
entity wanders throughout these various types of bodies and throughout different planets, and thus he is
like King Puranjana, who traveled all over the world looking for a suitable place to live.
Sri Narottama dasa Thakura has sung, karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda: "The path of
karma-kanda [fruitive activities] and the path of jnana-kanda [speculation] are just like strong pots of
poison." Amrta baliya yeba khaya, nana yoni sada phire: "A person who mistakes this poison to be nectar
and drinks it travels in different species of life." Kadarya bhaksana kare: "And, according to his body, he
eats all types of abominable things." For instance, when the living entity is in the body of a hog, he eats
stool. When the living entity is in the body of a crow, he eats all kinds of refuse, even pus and mucus, and
enjoys it. Thus Narottama dasa Thakura points out that the living entity travels in different types of
bodies and eats all kinds of abominable things. When he does not become ultimately happy, he becomes
morose or takes to the ways of hippies.
Thus in this verse it is said (na anurupam) that the King could never find a place suitable for his
purposes. This is because in any form of life and on any planet in the material world, a living entity
cannot be happy because everything in the material world is unsuitable for the spirit soul. As stated in this
verse, the living entity independently wants to become a prabhu, but as soon as he gives up this idea and
becomes a servant of God, Krsna, his happiness immediately begins. Therefore Srila Bhaktivinoda
Thakura sings:
miche mayara vase, yaccha bhese',
khaccha habudubu, bhai
"My dear living entity, why are you being carried away by the waves of maya?" As stated in the
Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."
The living entity is carried in the machine of the body through so many species of life on so many
planets. Therefore Bhaktivinoda Thakura asks the living entity why he is being carried away in these
bodily machines to be placed in so many different circumstances. He advises that one surmount the waves
of maya by surrendering unto Krsna.
jiva krsna-dasa, ei visvasa,
karle ta' ara duhkha nai
As soon as we confront Krsna, Krsna advises:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." (Bg. 18.66)
Thus we are immediately relieved from traveling from one body to another and from one planet to
another. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says: brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva (Cc. Madhya 19.151).
If, while traveling, a living entity becomes fortunate enough to become blessed by the association of
devotees and to come to Krsna consciousness, his real life actually begins. This Krsna consciousness
movement is giving all wandering living entities a chance to take to the shelter of Krsna and thus become
happy.
In this verse the words vimana iva are very significant. In this material world even the great King of
heaven is also full of anxiety. If even Lord Brahma is full of anxiety, what of these ordinary living entities
who are working within this planet? Bhagavad-gita (8.16) confirms:
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein
repeated birth and death take place." In the material world a living entity is never satisfied. Even in the
position of Brahma or in the position of Indra or Candra, one is full of anxiety simply because he has
accepted this material world as a place of happiness.
