TRANSLATION
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, when thus asked to accept a benediction from
Kuvera the Yaksaraja [King of the Yaksas], Dhruva Maharaja, that most elevated pure devotee, who was
an intelligent and thoughtful king, begged that he might have unflinching faith in and remembrance of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for thus a person can cross over the ocean of nescience very easily,
although it is very difficult for others to cross.
PURPORT
According to the opinion of expert followers of Vedic rites, there are different types of benedictions in
terms of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. These four principles are
known as catur-vargas. Of all the catur-vargas, the benediction of liberation is considered to be the
highest in this material world. To be enabled to cross over material nescience is known as the highest
purusartha, or benediction for the human being. But Dhruva Maharaja wanted a benediction which
surpasses even the highest purusartha, liberation. He wanted the benediction that he might constantly
remember the lotus feet of the Lord. This stage of life is called pancama-purusartha. When a devotee
comes to the platform of pancama-purusartha, simply engaging in devotional service to the Lord, the
fourth purusartha, liberation, becomes very insignificant in his eyes. Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has
stated in this connection that for a devotee liberation is a hellish condition of life; as for sense
gratification, which is available in the heavenly planets, the devotee considers it to be a will-o'-the-wisp,
having no value in life. Yogis endeavor to control the senses, but for a devotee controlling the senses is no
difficulty at all. The senses are compared to serpents, but for a devotee the serpents' poison teeth are
broken. Thus Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has analyzed all kinds of benedictions available in this world,
and he has clearly declared that for a pure devotee they are all of no significance. Dhruva Maharaja was
also a maha-bhagavata, or a first-class pure devotee, and his intelligence was very great (maha-matih).
Unless one is very intelligent, one cannot take to devotional service, or Krsna consciousness. Naturally,
anyone who is a first-class devotee must be a first-class intelligent person and therefore not interested in
any kind of benediction within this material world. Dhruva Maharaja was offered a benediction by the
king of the kings. Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, whose only business is to supply immense riches
to persons within this materialistic world, is described as the king of kings because unless one is blessed
by Kuvera one cannot become a king. The king of kings personally offered Dhruva Maharaja any amount
of riches, but he declined to accept them. He is described, therefore, as maha-matih, very thoughtful, or
highly intellectual.
