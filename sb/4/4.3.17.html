<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the six qualities education, austerity, wealth, beauty, youth and heritage are for the highly
elevated, one who is proud of possessing them becomes blind, and thus he loses his good sense and
cannot appreciate the glories of great personalities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It may be argued that since Daksa was very learned, wealthy and austere and had descended from a very
exalted heritage, how could he be unnecessarily angry towards another? The answer is that when the
qualities of good education, good parentage, beauty and sufficient wealth are misplaced in a person who is
puffed up by all these possessions, they produce a very bad result. Milk is a very nice food, but when milk
is touched by an envious serpent it becomes poisonous. Similarly, material assets such as education,
wealth, beauty and good parentage are undoubtedly nice, but when they decorate persons of a malicious
nature, then they act adversely. Another example, given by Canakya Pandita, is that a serpent that has a
jewel on its head is still fearful because it is a serpent. A serpent, by nature, is envious of other living
entities, even though they be faultless. When a serpent bites another creature, it is not necessarily because
the other creature is at fault; it is the habit of the serpent to bite innocent creatures. Similarly, although
Daksa was qualified by many material assets, because he was proud of his possessions and because he was
envious, all those qualities were polluted. It is sometimes, therefore, detrimental for a person advancing in
spiritual consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, to possess such material assets. Kuntidevi, while offering
prayers to Krsna, addressed Him as akincana-gocara, one who is easily approached by those who are
bereft of all material acquisitions. Material exhaustion is an advantage for advancement in Krsna
consciousness, although if one is conscious of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one can utilize one's material assets, such as great learning and beauty and exalted ancestry, for
the service of the Lord; then such assets become glorious. In other words, unless one is Krsna conscious,
all his material possessions are zero, but when this zero is by the side of the Supreme One, it at once
increases in value to ten. Unless situated by the side of the Supreme One, zero is always zero; one may add
one hundred zeros, but the value will still remain zero. Unless one's material assets are used in Krsna
consciousness, they may play havoc and degrade the possessor.
