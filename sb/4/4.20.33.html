<h2>Translation</h2>
Prthu Maharaja advised his citizens: Engaging your minds, your words, your bodies and the results of
your occupational duties, and being always open-minded, you should all render devotional service to the
Lord. According to your abilities and the occupations in which you are situated, you should engage your
service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead with full confidence and without
reservation. Then you will surely be successful in achieving the final objective in your lives.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Eighteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, sva-karmana tam abhyarcya: one has to worship
the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one's occupational duties. This necessitates accepting the
principle of four varnas and four asramas. Prthu Maharaja therefore says, gunaih sva-karmabhih. This
phrase is explained in Bhagavad-gita. Catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "The four
castes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras) are created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
according to the material modes of nature and the particular duties discharged in those modes." A person
who is situated in the mode of goodness is certainly more intelligent than others. Therefore he can
practice the brahminical activities--namely speaking the truth, controlling the senses, controlling the
mind, remaining always clean, practicing tolerance, having full knowledge about one's self-identity, and
understanding devotional service. In this way, if he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord as an
actual brahmana, his aim to achieve the final interest of life is attained. Similarly, the ksatriya's duties are
to give protection to the citizens, to give all his possessions in charity, to be strictly Vedic in the
management of state affairs and to be unafraid to fight whenever there is an attack by enemies. In this
way, a ksatriya can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his occupational duties. Similarly, a
vaisya can satisfy the Supreme Godhead by properly executing his occupational duties--engaging himself
in producing foodstuffs, giving protection to cows, and trading if necessary when there is an excess of
agricultural production. Similarly, because sudras do not have ample intelligence, they should simply
engage as workers to serve the higher statuses of social life. Everyone's aim should be to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by engaging his mind in thinking always of Krsna, his words in always
offering prayers to the Lord or preaching about the glories of the Lord, and his body in executing the
service required to satisfy the Lord. As there are four divisions within our body--the head, the arms, the
belly and the legs--similarly, human society, taken as a whole, is divided into four classes of men
according to their material qualities and occupational duties. Thus the brahminical or intelligent men
have to execute the duty of the head, the ksatriyas must fulfill the duty of the arms, the vaisya class must
fulfill the duty of the belly, and the sudras must fulfill the duty of the legs. In executing the prescribed
duties of life, no one is higher or lower; there are such divisions as "higher" and "lower," but since there is
actually a common interest--to satisfy the Supreme personality of Godhead--there are no distinctions
between them.
The question may be raised that since the Lord is supposed to be worshiped by great demigods like Lord
Brahma, Lord Siva and others, how can an ordinary human being on this planet serve Him? This is clearly
explained by Prthu Maharaja by the use of the word yathadhikara, "according to one's ability." If one
sincerely executes his occupational duty, that will be sufficient. One does not need to become like Lord
Brahma, Lord Siva, Indra, Lord Caitanya or Ramanujacarya, whose capabilities are certainly far above
ours. Even a sudra, who is in the lowest stage of life according to the material qualities, can achieve the
same success. Anyone can become successful in devotional service provided he displays no duplicity. It is
explained here that one must be very frank and open-minded (amayinah). To be situated in a lower status
of life is not a disqualification for success in devotional service. The only qualification is that whether one
is a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, he must be open, frank and free from reservations. Then, by
performing his particular occupational duty under the guidance of a proper spiritual master, he can
achieve the highest success in life. As confirmed by the Lord Himself, striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te 'pi
yanti param gatim (Bg. 9.32). It does not matter what one is, whether a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra
or a degraded woman. If one engages himself seriously in devotional service, working with body, mind
and intelligence, he is sure to be successful in going back home, back to Godhead. The Lord's lotus feet
are described here as kama-dughanghri-pankajam because they have all power to fulfill the desires of
everyone. A devotee is happy even in this life because although in material existence we have many needs,
all his material needs are satisfied, and when he at last quits his body, he goes back home, back to
Godhead, without a doubt.
