<h2>Translation</h2>
[The form of the Lord is described herein.] The Lord's face is perpetually very beautiful and pleasing in
attitude. To the devotees who see Him, He appears never to be displeased, and He is always prepared to
award benedictions to them. His eyes, His nicely decorated eyebrows, His raised nose and His broad
forehead are all very beautiful. He is more beautiful than all the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse clearly explains how one has to meditate on the form of the Lord. Impersonal meditation is a
bogus invention of modern days. In none of the Vedic literatures is impersonal meditation recommended.
In Bhagavad-gita, when meditation is recommended, the word mat-parah, which means "pertaining to
Me," is used. Any Visnu form pertains to Lord Krsna because Lord Krsna is the original Visnu form.
Sometimes someone tries to meditate upon the impersonal Brahman, which is described in Bhagavad-gita
as avyakta, meaning "unmanifested" or "impersonal." But it is remarked by the Lord Himself that those
who are attached to this impersonal feature of the Lord suffer a very troublesome task because no one can
concentrate on the impersonal feature. One has to concentrate on the form of the Lord, which is described
here in connection with Dhruva Maharaja's meditation. As will be apparent from later descriptions,
Dhruva Maharaja perfected this kind of meditation, and his yoga was successful.
