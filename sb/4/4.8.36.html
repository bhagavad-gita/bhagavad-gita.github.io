<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, persons like you, who are pure devotees of the
lotus feet of Mukunda [the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can offer liberation] and who are
always attached to the honey of His lotus feet, are always satisfied in serving at the lotus feet of the Lord.
In any condition of life, such persons remain satisfied, and thus they never ask the Lord for material
prosperity.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor of everything
and anything within this creation, and the supreme friend of everyone. When one knows these things
perfectly, he is always satisfied. The pure devotee never hankers after any kind of material prosperity. The
karmis, however, or jnanis or yogis endeavor always for their own personal happiness. Karmis work day
and night to improve their economic condition, jnanis undergo severe austerities in order to get
liberation, and yogis also undergo severe austerities by practicing the yoga system for attainment of
wonderful mystic powers. A devotee, however, is not interested in such activities; he does not want mystic
powers or liberation or material prosperity. He is satisfied in any condition of life, as long as he is
constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. The Lord's feet are compared to the lotus, wherein there is
saffron dust. A devotee is always engaged in drinking the honey from the lotus feet of the Lord. Unless
one is freed from all material desires, he cannot actually taste the honey from the Lord's lotus feet. One
has to discharge his devotional duties without being disturbed by the coming and going of material
circumstances. This desirelessness for material prosperity is called niskama. One should not mistakenly
think that niskama means giving up all desires. That is impossible. A living entity is eternally existent, and
he cannot give up desires. A living entity must have desires; that is the symptom of life. When there is a
recommendation to become desireless, it is to be understood that this means that we should not desire
anything for our sense gratification. For a devotee this state of mind, nihsprha, is the right position.
Actually every one of us already has an arrangement for our standard of material comforts. A devotee
should always remain satisfied with the standard of comforts offered by the Lord, as stated in the
Isopanisad (tena tyaktena bhunjithah). This saves time for executing Krsna consciousness.
