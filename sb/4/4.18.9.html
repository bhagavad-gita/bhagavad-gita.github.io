<h2>Text</h2>
sindhavo ratna-nikaran
girayo 'nnam catur-vidham
upayanam upajahruh
sarve lokah sa-palakah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sindhavah--the oceans; ratna-nikaran--heaps of jewels; girayah--the hills; annam--eatables; catuhvidham--
four kinds of; upayanam--presentations; upajahruh--brought forward; sarve--all; lokah--the
people in general of all planets; sa-palakah--along with the governors.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Prthu was presented with various gifts from the general populace and predominating deities of all
planets. The oceans and seas were full of valuable jewels and pearls, and the hills were full of chemicals
and fertilizers. Four kinds of edibles were produced profusely.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Isopanisad, this material creation is supplied with all the potencies for the production of all
necessities required by the living entities--not only human beings, but animals, reptiles, aquatics and
trees. The oceans and seas produce pearls, coral and valuable jewels so that fortunate law-abiding people
can utilize them. Similarly, the hills are full of chemicals so that when rivers flow down from them the
chemicals spread over the fields to fertilize the four kinds of foodstuffs. These are technically known as
carvya (those edibles which are chewed), lehya (those which are licked up), cusya (those which are
swallowed) and peya (those which are drunk).
Prthu Maharaja was greeted by the residents of other planets and their presiding deities. They presented
various gifts to the King and acknowledged him as the proper type of king by whose planning and
activities everyone throughout the universe could be happy and prosperous. It is clearly indicated in this
verse that the oceans and seas are meant for producing jewels, but in Kali-yuga the oceans are mainly
being utilized for fishing. Sudras and poor men were allowed to fish, but the higher classes like the
ksatriyas and vaisyas would gather pearls, jewels and coral. Although poor men would catch tons of fish,
they would not be equal in value to one piece of coral or pearl. In this age so many factories for the
manufacture of fertilizers have been opened, but when the Personality of Godhead is pleased by the
performance of yajnas, the hills automatically produce fertilizing chemicals, which help produce edibles
in the fields. Everything is dependent on the people's acceptance of the Vedic principles of sacrifice.
