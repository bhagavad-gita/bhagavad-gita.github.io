asti yajna-patir nama
kesancid arha-sattamah
ihamutra ca laksyante
jyotsnavatyah kvacid bhuvah
SYNONYMS
asti--there must be; yajna-patih--the enjoyer of all sacrifices; nama--of the name; kesancit--in the
opinion of some; arha-sattamah--O most respectable; iha--in this material world; amutra--after death; ca--
also; laksyante--it is visible; jyotsna-vatyah--powerful, beautiful; kvacit--somewhere; bhuvah--bodies.
TRANSLATION
My dear respectable ladies and gentlemen, according to the authoritative statements of sastra, there
must be a supreme authority who is able to award the respective benefits of our present activities.
Otherwise, why should there be persons who are unusually beautiful and powerful both in this life and in
the life after death?
PURPORT
Prthu Maharaja's sole aim in ruling his kingdom was to raise the citizens to the standard of God
consciousness. Since there was a great assembly in the arena of sacrifice, there were different types of men
present, but he was especially interested in speaking to those who were not atheists. It has already been
explained in the previous verses that Prthu Maharaja advised the citizens to become adhoksaja-dhiyah,
which means God conscious, or Krsna conscious, and in this verse he specifically presents the authority of
sastra, even though his father was a number one atheist who did not abide by the injunctions mentioned
in the Vedic sastras, who practically stopped all sacrificial performances and who so disgusted the
brahmanas that they not only dethroned him but cursed and killed him. Atheistic men do not believe in
the existence of God, and thus they understand everything which is happening in our daily affairs to be
due to physical arrangement and chance. Atheists believe in the atheistic Sankhya philosophy of the
combination of prakrti and purusa. They believe only in matter and hold that matter under certain
conditions of amalgamation gives rise to the living force, which then appears as purusa, the enjoyer; then,
by a combination of matter and the living force, the many varieties of material manifestation come into
existence. Nor do atheists believe in the injunctions of the Vedas. According to them, all the Vedic
injunctions are simply theories that have no practical application in life. Taking all this into consideration,
Prthu Maharaja suggested that theistic men will solidly reject the views of the atheists on the grounds that
there cannot be many varieties of existence without the plan of a superior intelligence. Atheists very
vaguely explain that these varieties of existence occur simply by chance, but the theists who believe in the
injunctions of the Vedas must reach all their conclusions under the direction of the Vedas.
In the Visnu Purana it is said that the entire varnasrama institution is meant to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The rules and regulations set up for the execution of the duties of brahmanas,
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras or brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis are all meant to satisfy
the Supreme Lord. At the present moment, although the so-called brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and
sudras have lost their original culture, they claim to be brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras by
birthright. Yet they have rejected the proposition that such social and spiritual orders are especially meant
for worship of Lord Visnu. The dangerous Mayavada theory set forth by Sankaracarya--that God is
impersonal--does not tally with the injunctions of the Vedas. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore
described the Mayavadi philosophers as the greatest offenders against the Personality of Godhead.
According to the Vedic system, one who does not abide by the orders of the Vedas is called a nastika, or
atheist. When Lord Buddha preached his theory of nonviolence, he was obliged to deny the authority of
the Vedas, and for this reason he was considered by the followers of the Vedas to be a nastika. But
although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu very clearly enunciated that the followers of Lord Buddha's philosophy
are nastikas, or atheists, because of their denial of the authority of the Vedas, He considered the
Sankarites, who wanted to establish Vedic authority by trickery and who actually followed the Mayavada
philosophy of Buddha's school, to be more dangerous than the Buddhists themselves. The Sankarite
philosophers' theory that we have to imagine a shape of God is more dangerous than denial of the
existence of God. Notwithstanding all the philosophical theorizing by atheists or Mayavadis, the followers
of Krsna consciousness rigidly live according to the injunctions given in Bhagavad-gita, which is accepted
as the essence of all Vedic scripture. In Bhagavad-gita (18.46) it is said:
yatah pravrttir bhutanam
yena sarvam idam tatam
sva-karmana tam abhyarcya
siddhim vindati manavah
"By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the
performance of his own duty, attain perfection." This indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is the original source of everything, as described in the Vedanta-sutra (janmady asya yatah). The Lord
Himself also confirms in Bhagavad-gita, aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am the origin of everything." The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of all emanations, and at the same time, as
Paramatma, He is spread all over existence. The Absolute Truth is therefore the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and every living being is meant to satisfy the Supreme Godhead by performing his respective
duty (sva-karmana tam abhyarcya). Maharaja Prthu wanted to introduce this formula amongst his
citizens.
The most important point in human civilization is that while one engages in different occupational
duties, he must try to satisfy the Supreme Lord by the execution of such duties. That is the highest
perfection of life. Svanusthitasya dharmasya samsiddhir hari-tosanam: by discharging one's prescribed
duty, one can become very successful in life if he simply satisfies the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The vivid example is Arjuna. He was a ksatriya, his duty was to fight, and by executing his prescribed
duty he satisfied the Supreme Lord and therefore became perfect. Everyone should follow this principle.
The atheists, who do not, are condemned in Bhagavad-gita (16.19) by the following statement: tan aham
dvisatah kruran samsaresu naradhaman. In this verse it is clearly said that persons who are envious of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead are the lowest of mankind and are very mischievous. Under the
regulative principles of the Supreme, such mischievous persons are thrown into the darkest region of
material existence and are born of asuras, or atheists. Birth after birth, such asuras go still further down,
finally to animal forms like those of tigers or similar ferocious beasts. Thus for millions of years they have
to remain in darkness without knowledge of Krsna.
The Supreme personality of Godhead is known as Purusottama, or the best of all living entities. He is a
person like all other living entities, but He is the leader or the best of all living beings. That is stated in the
Vedas also. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. He is the chief of all eternals, the chief of all living
entities, and He is complete and full. He has no need to derive benefit by interfering with the affairs of
other living entities, but because He is the maintainer of all, He has the right to bring them to the proper
standard so that all living entities may become happy. A father wants all of his children to become happy
under his direction. Similarly, God, or Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has the right to see
that all living entities are happy. There is no possibility of becoming happy within this material world.
The father and the sons are eternal, but if a living entity does not come to the platform of his eternal life of
bliss and knowledge, there is no question of happiness. Although Purusottama, the best of all living
entities, has no benefit to derive from the common living entities, He does have the right to discriminate
between their right and wrong ways. The right way is the path of activities meant to satisfy the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, as we have already discussed (svanusthitasya dharmasya samsiddhir haritosanam).
A living entity may engage in any occupational duty, but if he wants to have perfection in his
duties, he must satisfy the Supreme Lord. As such, one who pleases Him gets better facilities for living,
but one who displeases Him gets involved in undesirable situations.
It is therefore concluded that there are two kinds of duties--mundane duty and duty performed for the
sake of yajna, or sacrifice (yajnarthat karma). Any karma (activity) one performs which is not for the
purpose of yajna is a cause of bondage. Yajnarthat karmano'nyatra loko'yam karma-bandhanah: "Work
done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." (Bg.
3.9) Karma-bandhanah, or the bondage of karma, is administered under the regulations of the stringent
laws of material nature. Material existence is a struggle to conquer the impediments put forth by material
nature. The asuras are always fighting to overcome these impediments, and by the illusory power of
material nature the foolish living entities work very hard within this material world and take this to be
happiness. This is called maya. In that hard struggle for existence, they deny the existence of the supreme
authority, Purusottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In order to regulate the activities of the living entities, God has given us codes, just as a king gives codes
of law in a state, and whoever breaks the law is punished. Similarly, the Lord has given the infallible
knowledge of the Vedas, which are not contaminated by the four defects of human life--namely the
tendency to commit mistakes, to be illusioned, to cheat and to have imperfect senses. If we do not take
direction from the Vedas but act whimsically according to our own choice, we are sure to be punished by
the laws of the Lord, who offers different types of bodies in the 8,400,000 species of forms. Material
existence, or the sense gratification process, is conducted according to the type of body we are given by
prakrti, or material nature. As such, there must be divisions of pious and impious activities (punya and
papa). In Bhagavad-gita (7.28) it is clearly stated:
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"One who has completely surpassed the resultant activities of the impious path of life [this is possible
only when one engages exclusively in pious activities] can understand his eternal relationship with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one engages in the Lord's transcendental loving service." This life
of engaging always in the loving service of the Lord is called adhoksaja-dhiyah, or a life of Krsna
consciousness, which King Prthu meant his citizens to follow.
The different varieties of life and of material existence do not come about by chance and necessity; they
are different arrangements made by the Supreme Lord in terms of the pious and impious activities of the
living entities. By performing pious activities one can take birth in a good family in a good nation, one can
get a beautiful body or can become very well educated or very rich. We see, therefore, that in different
places and in different planets there are different standards of life, bodily features and educational
statuses, all awarded by the Supreme personality of Godhead according to pious or impious activities.
Varieties of life, therefore, develop not by chance but by prearrangement. There is a plan, which is already
outlined in the Vedic knowledge. One has to take advantage of this knowledge and mold his life in such a
way that at the end, especially in the human form of life, he may go back home, back to Godhead, by
practicing Krsna consciousness.
The theory of chance can best be explained in the Vedic literature by the words ajnata-sukrti, which
refer to pious activities performed without the actor's knowledge. But these are also planned. For
example, Krsna comes like an ordinary human being, He comes as a devotee like Lord Caitanya, or He
sends His representative, the spiritual master, or pure devotee. This is also the planned activity of the
Supreme personality of Godhead. They come to canvass and educate, and thus a person in the illusory
energy of the Supreme Lord gets a chance to mix with them, talk with them and take lessons from them,
and somehow or other if a conditioned soul surrenders to such personalities and by intimate association
with them chances to become Krsna conscious, he is saved from the material conditions of life. Krsna
therefore instructs:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." (Bg. 18.66) The word sarva-papebhyah means "from all sinful activities." A person who
surrenders unto Him by utilizing the chance to associate with the pure devotee, spiritual master or other
authorized incarnations of Godhead, like Prthu Maharaja, is saved by Krsna. Then his life becomes
successful.

TRANSLATION
This is confirmed not only by the evidence of the Vedas but also by the personal behavior of great
personalities like Manu, Uttanapada, Dhruva, Priyavrata and my grandfather Anga, as well as by many
other great personalities and ordinary living entities, exemplified by Maharaja Prahlada and Bali, all of
whom are theists, believing in the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who carries a club.
PURPORT
Narottama dasa Thakura states that one has to ascertain the right path for his activities by following in
the footsteps of great saintly persons and books of knowledge under the guidance of a spiritual master
(sadhu-sastra-guru-vakya). A saintly person is one who follows the Vedic injunctions, which are the
orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word guru refers to one who gives proper direction
under the authority of the Vedic injunctions and according to the examples of the lives of great
personalities. The best way to mold one's life is to follow in the footsteps of the authorized personalities
like those mentioned herein by Prthu Maharaja, beginning with Svayambhuva Manu. The safest path in
life is to follow such great personalities, especially those mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The
mahajanas, or great personalities, are Brahma, Lord Siva, Narada Muni, Manu, the Kumaras, Prahlada
Maharaja, Bali Maharaja, Yamaraja, Bhisma, Janaka, Sukadeva Gosvami and Kapila Muni.
