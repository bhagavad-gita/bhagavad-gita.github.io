<h2>Text</h2>
atah kayam imam vidvan
avidya-kama-karmabhih
arabdha iti naivasmin
pratibuddho 'nusajjate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atah--therefore; kayam--body; imam--this; vidvan--he who has knowledge; avidya--by nescience; kama--
desires; karmabhih--and by activities; arabdhah--created; iti--thus; na--never; eva--certainly; asmin--to this
body; pratibuddhah--one who knows; anusajjate--becomes addicted.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are in full knowledge of the bodily conception of life, who know that this body is composed
of nescience, desires and activities resulting from illusion, do not become addicted to the body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in a previous verse, those with good intellect (sudhiyah) do not accept themselves to be the
body. Being a creation of nescience, the body has two types of activities. In the bodily conception, when
we think that sense gratification will help us, we are in illusion. Another kind of illusion is to think that
one will become happy by trying to satisfy the desires that arise from the illusory body or by attaining
elevation to the higher planetary systems or by performing various types of Vedic rituals. This is all
illusion. Similarly, material activities performed for political emancipation and social and humanitarian
activities performed with an idea that people of the world will be happy are also illusory because the basic
principle is the bodily conception, which is illusory. Whatever we desire or perform under the bodily
conception is all illusion. In other words, Lord Visnu informed Prthu Maharaja that although the
sacrificial performances set an example for ordinary people, there was no need for such sacrificial
performances as far as his personal self was concerned. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.45):
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the self."
The ritualistic performances recommended in the Vedas mainly depend on the three modes of material
nature. Consequently Arjuna was advised to transcend the Vedic activities. The activities Arjuna was
advised to perform were the transcendental activities of devotional service.
