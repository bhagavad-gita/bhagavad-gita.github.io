<h2>Text</h2>
yat-pada-padmam mahatam mano-'libhir
nisevitam brahma-rasasavarthibhih
lokasya yad varsati casiso 'rthinas
tasmai bhavan druhyati visva-bandhave
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat-pada-padmam--the lotus feet of whom; mahatam--of the higher personalities; manah-alibhih--by the
bees of the mind; nisevitam--being engaged at; brahma-rasa--of transcendental bliss (brahmananda);
asava-arthibhih--seeking the nectar; lokasya--of the common man; yat--which; varsati--he fulfills; ca--and;
asisah--desires; arthinah--seeking; tasmai--towards him (Lord Siva); bhavan--you; druhyati--are envious;
visva-bandhave--unto the friend of all living entities within the three worlds.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
You are envious of Lord Siva, who is the friend of all living entities within the three worlds. For the
common man he fulfills all desires, and because of their engagement in thinking of his lotus feet, he also
blesses higher personalities who are seeking after brahmananda [transcendental bliss].
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Ordinarily there are two classes of men. One class, who are grossly materialistic, want material
prosperity, and their desires are fulfilled if they worship Lord Siva. Lord Siva, being very quickly satisfied,
satisfies the material desires of the common man very quickly; therefore it is seen that ordinary men are
very much apt to worship him. Next, those who are disgusted or frustrated with the materialistic way of
life worship Lord Siva to attain salvation, which entails freedom from material identification. One who
understands that he is not the material body but is spirit soul is liberated from ignorance. Lord Siva also
offers that facility. People generally practice religion for economic development, to get some money, for
by getting money they can satisfy their senses. But when they are frustrated they want spiritual
brahmananda, or merging into the Supreme. These four principles of material life--religion, economic
development, sense gratification and liberation--exist, and Lord Siva is the friend of both the ordinary
man and the man who is elevated in spiritual knowledge. Thus it was not good for Daksa to create enmity
towards him. Even Vaisnavas, who are above both the ordinary and the elevated men in this world, also
worship Lord Siva as the greatest Vaisnava. Thus he is the friend of everyone--the common men, the
elevated men and the devotees of the Lord--so no one should disrespect or create enmity towards Lord
Siva.
