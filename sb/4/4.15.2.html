<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The reciters continued: Dear King, you are a direct incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Lord Visnu, and by His causeless mercy you have descended on this earth. Therefore it is not possible for
us to actually glorify your exalted activities. Although you have appeared through the body of King Vena,
even great orators and speakers like Lord Brahma and other demigods cannot exactly describe the
glorious activities of Your Lordship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word mayaya means "by your causeless mercy." The Mayavadi philosophers explain the
word maya as meaning "illusion" or "falseness." However, there is another meaning of maya--that is,
"causeless mercy." There are two kinds of maya--yogamaya and mahamaya. Mahamaya is an expansion of
yogamaya, and both these mayas are different expressions of the Lord's internal potencies. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, the Lord appears through His internal potencies (atma-mayaya). We should therefore
reject the Mayavada explanation that the Lord appears in a body given by the external potency, the
material energy. The Lord and His incarnation are fully independent and can appear anywhere and
everywhere by virtue of the internal potency. Although born out of the so-called dead body of King Vena,
King Prthu was still an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the Lord's internal potency.
The Lord can appear in any family. Sometimes He appears as a fish incarnation (matsya-avatara) or a boar
incarnation (varaha-avatara). Thus the Lord is completely free and independent to appear anywhere and
everywhere by His internal potency. It is stated that Ananta, an incarnation of the Lord who has unlimited
mouths, cannot reach the end of His glorification of the Lord, although Ananta has been describing the
Lord since time immemorial. So what to speak of demigods like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and others? It is
said that the Lord is siva-virinci-nutam--always worshiped by demigods like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.
If the demigods cannot find adequate language to express the glories of the Lord, then what to speak of
others? Consequently reciters like the suta and magadha felt inadequate to speak about King Prthu.
By glorifying the Lord with exalted verses, one becomes purified. Although we are unable to offer
prayers to the Lord in an adequate fashion, our duty is to make the attempt in order to purify ourselves. It
is not that we should stop our glorification because demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva cannot
adequately glorify the Lord. Rather, as stated by Prahlada Maharaja, everyone should glorify the Lord
according to his own ability. If we are serious and sincere devotees, the Lord will give us the intelligence
to offer prayers properly.
