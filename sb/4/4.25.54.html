<h2>Text</h2>
hamsav aham ca tvam carya
sakhayau manasayanau
abhutam antara vaukah
sahasra-parivatsaran
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hamsau--two swans; aham--I; ca--and; tvam--you; ca--also; arya--O great soul; sakhayau--friends;
manasa-ayanau--together in the Manasa Lake; abhutam--became; antara--separated; va--indeed; okah--
from the original home; sahasra--thousands; pari--successively; vatsaran--years.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear gentle friend, both you and I are exactly like two swans. We live together in the same heart,
which is just like the Manasa Lake. Although we have been living together for many thousands of years,
we are still far away from our original home.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The original home of the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the spiritual world. In
the spiritual world both the Lord and the living entities live together very peacefully. Since the living
entity remains engaged in the service of the Lord, they both share a blissful life in the spiritual world.
However, when the living entity wants to enjoy himself, he falls down into the material world. Even while
he is in that position, the Lord remains with him as the Supersoul, his intimate friend. Because of his
forgetfulness, the living entity does not know that the Supreme Lord is accompanying him as the
Supersoul. In this way the living entity remains conditioned in each and every millennium. Although the
Lord follows him as a friend, the living entity, because of forgetful material existence, does not recognize
Him.
