<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way, increasingly overwhelmed by illusion, King Puranjana, although advanced in
consciousness, remained always lying down with his head on the pillow of his wife's arms. In this way he
considered woman to be his ultimate life and soul. Becoming thus overwhelmed by the mode of
ignorance, he could not understand the meaning of self-realization, of his self or of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Human life is meant for self-realization. First of all one has to realize his own self, which is described in
this verse as nijam. Then he has to understand or realize the Supersoul, or Paramatma, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. However, when one becomes too much materially attached, he takes a woman to
be everything. This is the basic principle of material attachment. In such a condition, one cannot realize
his own self or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) it is therefore said:
mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimuktes tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam. If one associates with
mahatmas, or devotees, his path of liberation is opened. But if one becomes too much attached to women
or to persons who are also attached to women--that is, attached to women directly or indirectly--he opens
the tamo-dvaram, the door to the darkest region of hellish life.
King Puranjana was a great soul, highly intellectual and possessed of advanced consciousness, but due
to his being too much addicted to women, his whole consciousness was covered. In the modern age the
consciousness of people is too much covered by wine, women and flesh. Consequently, people are
completely unable to make any progress in self-realization. The first step of self-realization is to know
oneself as spirit soul apart from the body. In the second stage of self-realization, one comes to know that
every soul, every individual living entity, is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, Paramatma, or the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah-sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind."
All living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, in this present civilization
both men and women are allowed to be attracted to one another from the very beginning of life, and
because of this they are completely unable to come to the platform of self-realization. They do not know
that without self-realization they suffer the greatest loss in the human form of life. Thinking of a woman
always within one's heart is tantamount to lying down with a woman on a valuable bedstead. The heart is
the bedstead, and it is the most valuable bedstead. When a man thinks of women and money, he lies
down and rests on the arms of his beloved woman or wife. In this way he overindulges in sex life and thus
becomes unfit for self-realization.
