<h2>Translation</h2>
All the sages said: Dear Dhruva, O son of King Uttanapada, may the Supreme Personality of Godhead
known as Sarngadhanva, who relieves the distresses of His devotees, kill all your threatening enemies. The
holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Therefore, simply by chanting and hearing the
holy name of the Lord, many men can be fully protected from fierce death without difficulty. Thus a
devotee is saved.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great rsis approached Dhruva Maharaja at a time when his mind was very perplexed due to the
magical feats exhibited by the Yaksas. A devotee is always protected by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. By His inspiration only, the sages came to encourage Dhruva Maharaja and assure him that
there was no danger because he was a soul fully surrendered to the Supreme Lord. By the grace of the
Lord, if a devotee, at the time of death, can simply chant His holy name--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--simply by chanting this maha-mantra,
he immediately surpasses the great ocean of the material sky and enters the spiritual sky. He never has to
come back for repetition of birth and death. Simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can
surpass the ocean of death, so Dhruva Maharaja was certainly able to surpass the illusory magical feats of
the Yaksas, which for the time being disturbed his mind.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Dhruva Maharaja's Fight With the Yaksas."
