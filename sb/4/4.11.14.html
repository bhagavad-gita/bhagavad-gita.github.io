<h2>Text</h2>
evam bahu-savam kalam
mahatmavicalendriyah
tri-vargaupayikam nitva
putrayadan nrpasanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; bahu--many; savam--years; kalam--time; maha-atma--great soul; avicala-indriyah--without
being disturbed by sense agitation; tri-varga--three kinds of worldly activities; aupayikam--favorable for
executing; nitva--having passed; putraya--to his son; adat--he handed over; nrpa-asanam--the royal
throne.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The self-controlled great soul Dhruva Maharaja thus passed many, many years favorably executing three
kinds of worldly activities, namely religiosity, economic development and satisfaction of all material
desires. Thereafter he handed over the charge of the royal throne to his son.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Perfection of materialistic life is suitably attained by the process of observing religious principles. This
leads automatically to successful economic development, and thus there is no difficulty in satisfying all
material desires. Since Dhruva Maharaja, as a king, had to keep up his status quo or it would not have
been possible to rule over the people in general, he did it perfectly. But as soon as he saw that his son was
grown up and could take charge of the royal throne, he immediately handed over the charge and retired
from all material engagements.
One word used here is very significant--avicalendriyah, which means that he was not disturbed by the
agitation of the senses nor was his sensory power diminished, although in years he was a very old man.
Since he ruled over the world for thirty-six thousand years, naturally one may conclude that he became
very, very old, but factually his senses were very young--and yet he was not interested in sense
gratification. In other words, he remained self-controlled. He performed his duties perfectly according to
the materialistic way. That is the way of behavior of great devotees. Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, one
of the direct disciples of Lord Caitanya, was the son of a very rich man. Although he had no interest in
enjoying material happiness, when he was entrusted with doing something in managing the state, he did it
perfectly. Srila Gaurasundara advised him, "From within, keep yourself and your mind completely aloof,
but externally execute the material duties just as they need to be done." This transcendental position can
be achieved by devotees only, as described in the Bhagavad-gita: while others, such as yogis, try to control
their senses by force, devotees, even though possessing full sensory powers, do not use them because they
engage in higher, transcendental activities.
