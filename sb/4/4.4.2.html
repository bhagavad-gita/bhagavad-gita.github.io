suhrt-didrksa--of the desire to see her relatives; pratighata--the prevention; durmanah--feeling sorry;
snehat--from affection; rudati--crying; asru-kala--by drops of tears; ativihvala--very much afflicted;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sati felt very sorry at being forbidden to go see her relatives at her father's house, and due to affection
for them, tears fell from her eyes. Shaking and very much afflicted, she looked at her uncommon husband,
Lord Siva, as if she were going to blast him with her vision.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word apratipurusam, used in this verse, means "one who has no equal." Lord Siva has no equal in
the material world in regard to equality towards everyone. His wife, Sati, knew that her husband was
equal towards everyone, so why in this case was he so unkind to his wife that he did not allow her to go to
her father's house? This distressed her more than she could tolerate, and she looked at her husband as if
she were ready to blast him with her vision. In other words, since Lord Siva is the atma (siva also means
atma), it is indicated here that Sati was prepared to commit suicide. Another meaning of the word
apratipurusa is "the personality who has no rival." Since Lord Siva could not be persuaded to give her
permission, Sati took shelter of a woman's last weapon, weeping, which forces a husband to agree to the
proposal of his wife.
