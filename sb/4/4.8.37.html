<h2>Text</h2>
akarnyatma-jam ayantam
samparetya yathagatam
raja na sraddadhe bhadram
abhadrasya kuto mama
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
akarnya--having heard; atma-jam--his son; ayantam--coming back; samparetya--after dying; yatha--as if;
agatam--coming back; raja--King Uttanapada; na--did not; sraddadhe--have any confidence; bhadram--
good fortune; abhadrasya--of the impious; kutah--whence; mama--my.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When King Uttanapada heard that his son Dhruva was coming back home, as if coming back to life after
death, he could not put his faith in this message, for he was doubtful of how it could happen. He
considered himself the most wretched, and therefore he thought that it was not possible for him to attain
such good fortune.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja, a five-year-old boy, went to the forest for penance and austerity, and the King could
not at all believe that a small boy of such a tender age could live in the forest. He was certain that Dhruva
was dead. He therefore could not fix his faith in the message that Dhruva Maharaja was coming back
home again. For him this message said that a dead man was coming back home, and so he could not
believe it. After Dhruva Maharaja's departure from home, King Uttanapada thought that he was the cause
of Dhruva's leaving, and thus he considered himself the most wretched. Therefore, even though it was
possible that his lost son was coming back from the kingdom of death, he thought that since he was most
sinful it was not possible for him to be so fortunate as to get back his lost son.
