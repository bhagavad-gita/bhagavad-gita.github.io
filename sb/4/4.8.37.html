<br>

<h2>Translation</h2>
O learned brahmana, I want to occupy a position more exalted than any yet achieved within the three
worlds by anyone, even by my fathers and grandfathers. If you will oblige, kindly advise me of an honest
path to follow by which I can achieve the goal of my life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja refused to accept the brahminical instruction of Narada Muni, naturally the
next question would be what sort of instruction he wanted. So even before Narada Muni asked, Dhruva
Maharaja expressed his heartfelt desire. His father, of course, was the emperor of the entire world, and his
grandfather, Lord Brahma, was the creator of the universe. Dhruva Maharaja expressed his desire to
possess a kingdom better than those of his father and grandfather. He frankly stated that he wanted a
kingdom which had no competitor within the three worlds, namely the higher, middle and lower
planetary systems. The greatest personality within this universe is Lord Brahma, and Dhruva Maharaja
wanted a position even greater than his. He wanted to take advantage of Narada Muni's presence because
he knew very well that if Narada Muni, the greatest devotee of Lord Krsna, could bless him or show him
the path, then certainly he would be able to occupy a more exalted position than any person within the
three worlds. Thus he wanted help from Naradaji to achieve that position. Dhruva Maharaja wanted a
position greater than that of Brahma. This was practically an impossible proposition, but by pleasing the
Supreme Personality of Godhead a devotee can achieve even the impossible.
One particular point mentioned here is that Dhruva Maharaja wanted to occupy an exalted position not
by hook or by crook, but by honest means. This indicates that if Krsna offered him such a position, then
he would accept it. That is the nature of a devotee. He may desire material gain, but he accepts it only if
Krsna offers it. Dhruva Maharaja was sorry to refuse the instruction of Narada Muni; therefore he
requested him to be merciful to him by showing a path by which he could fulfill his mind's desires.
