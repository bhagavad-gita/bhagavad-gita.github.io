<h2>Text</h2>
tasmin maha-yogamaye
mumuksu-sarane surah
dadrsuh sivam asinam
tyaktamarsam ivantakam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmin--under that tree; maha-yoga-maye--having many sages engaged in meditation on the Supreme;
mumuksu--of those who desire liberation; sarane--the shelter; surah--the demigods; dadrsuh--saw;
sivam--Lord Siva; asinam--seated; tyakta-amarsam--having given up anger; iva--as; antakam--eternal time.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods saw Lord Siva sitting under that tree, which was competent to give perfection to mystic
yogis and deliver all people. As grave as time eternal, he appeared to have given up all anger.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word maha-yogamaye is very significant. Yoga means meditation on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and maha-yoga means those who engage in the devotional service of Visnu.
Meditation means remembering, smaranam. There are nine different kinds of devotional service, of which
smaranam is one process; the yogi remembers the form of Visnu within his heart. Thus there were many
devotees engaged in meditation on Lord Visnu under the big banyan tree.
The Sanskrit word maha is derived from the affix mahat. This affix is used when there is a great number
or quantity, so maha-yoga indicates that there were many great yogis and devotees meditating on the form
of Lord Visnu. Generally such meditators are desirous of liberation from material bondage, and they are
promoted to the spiritual world, to one of the Vaikunthas. Liberation means freedom from material
bondage or nescience. ln the material world we are suffering life after life because of our bodily
identification, and liberation is freedom from that miserable condition of life.
