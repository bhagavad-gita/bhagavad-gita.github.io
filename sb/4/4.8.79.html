tariva savyetaratah pade pade
SYNONYMS
yada--when; eka--with one; padena--leg; sah--Dhruva Maharaja; parthiva--the King's; arbhakah--child;
tasthau--remained standing; tat-angustha--his big toe; nipidita--being pressed; mahi--the earth; nanama--

iva--like a boat; savya-itaratah--right and left; pade pade--in every step.
TRANSLATION
As Dhruva Maharaja, the King's son, kept himself steadily standing on one leg, the pressure of his big
toe pushed down half the earth, just as an elephant being carried on a boat rocks the boat left and right
with his every step.
PURPORT
The most significant expression in this verse is parthivarbhakah, son of the King. When Dhruva
Maharaja was at home, although he was a king's son, he was prevented from getting on the lap of his
father. But when he became advanced in self-realization, or devotional service, by the pressure of his toe
he could push down the whole earth. That is the difference between ordinary consciousness and Krsna
consciousness. In ordinary consciousness a king's son may be refused something even by his father, but
when the same person becomes fully Krsna conscious within his heart, he can push down the earth with
the pressure of his toe.
One cannot argue, "How is it that Dhruva Maharaja, who was prevented from getting up on the lap of
his father, could press down the whole earth?" This argument is not very much appreciated by the
learned, for it is an example of nagna-matrka logic. By this logic one would think that because his mother
in her childhood was naked, she should remain naked even when she is grown up. The stepmother of
Dhruva Maharaja might have been thinking in a similar way: since she had refused to allow him to get up
on the lap of his father, how could Dhruva perform such wonderful activities as pressing down the whole
earth? She must have been very surprised when she learned that Dhruva Maharaja, by concentrating
constantly on the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, could press down the entire earth,
like an elephant who presses down the boat on which it is loaded.
