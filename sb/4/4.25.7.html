<h2>Text</h2>
visirnam sva-purim viksya
pratikulan anadrtan
putran pautranugamatyan
jayam ca gata-sauhrdam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
visirnam--scattered; sva-purim--his own town; viksya--seeing; pratikulan--opposing elements;
anadrtan--being disrespectful; putran--sons; pautra--grandsons; anuga--servants; amatyan--ministers;
jayam--wife; ca--and; gata-sauhrdam--indifferent.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana then saw that everything in his town was scattered and that his sons, grandsons,
servants and ministers were all gradually opposing him. He also noted that his wife was becoming cold
and indifferent.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one becomes an invalid, his senses and organs are weakened. In other words, they are no longer
under one's control. The senses and sense objects then begin to oppose him. When a person is in a
distressed condition, even his family members--his sons, grandsons and wife--become disrespectful. They
no longer are under the command of the master of the house. Just as we wish to use our senses for sense
gratification, the senses also require strength from the body in reciprocation. A man keeps a family for
enjoyment, and similarly family members demand enjoyment from the head of the family. When they do
not receive sufficient money from him, they grow disinterested and ignore his commands or desires. This
is all due to one's being a krpana (miser). This word krpana, used in the sixth verse, is in opposition to
the word brahmana. In the human form of life one should become a brahmana, which means that one
should understand the constitutional position of the Absolute Truth, Brahman, and then engage in His
service as a Vaisnava. We get this facility in the human form of life, but if we do not properly utilize this
opportunity, we become a krpana, miser. A miser is one who gets money but does not spend it properly.
This human form of life is especially meant for understanding Brahman, for becoming a brahmana, and if
we do not utilize it properly, we remain a krpana. We can actually see that when one has money but does
not spend it, he remains a miser and is never happy. Similarly, when one's intelligence is spoiled due to
sense gratification, he remains a miser throughout his life.
