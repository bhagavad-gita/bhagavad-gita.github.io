returning, he took a bath and had an appropriate dinner. Then he took rest and thus became freed from
all restlessness.

<h2>Purport</h2>
A materialistic person works throughout the whole week very, very hard. He is always asking, "Where is
money? Where is money?" Then, at the end of the week, he wants to retire from these activities and go to
some secluded place to rest. King Puranjana returned to his home because he was very much fatigued
from hunting animals in the forest. In this way his conscience came to stop him from committing further
sinful activities and make him return home. In Bhagavad-gita materialistic persons are described as
duskrtinah, which indicates those who are always engaged in sinful activities. When a person comes to his
senses and understands how he is engaging in sinful activities, he returns to his conscience, which is
herein figuratively described as the palace. Generally a materialistic person is infected by the material
modes of passion and ignorance. The results of passion and ignorance are lust and greed. In the life of a
materialist, activity means working in lust and greed. However, when he comes to his senses, he wants to
retire. According to Vedic civilization, such retirement is positively recommended, and this portion of life
is called vanaprastha. Retirement is absolutely necessary for a materialist who wants to become free from
the activities of a sinful life.
King Puranjana's coming home, taking bath and having an appropriate dinner indicate that a
materialistic person must retire from sinful activities and become purified by accepting a spiritual master
and hearing from him about the values of life. If one would do this, he would feel completely refreshed,
just as one feels after taking a bath. After receiving initiation from a bona fide spiritual master, one must
abandon all kinds of sinful activities, namely illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating.
The word ucitaharah used in this verse is important. Ucita means "appropriate." One must eat
appropriately and not take after food as hogs take after stool. For a human being there are eatables
described in Bhagavad-gita (17.8) as sattvika-ahara, or food in the mode of goodness. One should not
indulge in eating food in the modes of passion and ignorance. This is called ucitahara, or appropriate
eating. One who is always eating meat or drinking liquor, which is eating and drinking in passion and
ignorance, must give these things up so that his real consciousness may be awakened. In this way one may
become peaceful and refreshed. If one is restless or fatigued, one cannot understand the science of God.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.20):
evam prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah
bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam
mukta-sangasya jayate
Unless one can become free from the influence of passion and ignorance, he cannot be pacified, and
without being pacified, one cannot understand the science of God. King Puranjana's returning home is
indicative of man's returning to his original consciousness, known as Krsna consciousness. Krsna
consciousness is absolutely necessary for one who has committed a lot of sinful activities, especially
killing animals or hunting in the forest.
