<h2>Translation</h2>
Attachment for the Supreme can be increased by practicing devotional service, inquiring about the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, applying bhakti-yoga in life, worshiping the Yogesvara, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and by hearing and chanting about the glories of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. These actions are pious in themselves.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word yogesvara is applicable to both the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and His devotees
also. In Bhagavad-gita this word occurs in two places. In the Eighteenth Chapter (18.78), Krsna is
described as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is the master of all mystic power (yatra
yogesvarah krsnah). Yogesvara is also described at the end of the Sixth Chapter (6.47): sa me yuktatamo
matah. This yuktatama indicates the topmost of all yogis--the devotees, who can also be called yogesvara.
In this verse, yogesvara-upasana means to render service to a pure devotee. Thus Narottama dasa Thakura
says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without serving a pure devotee, one cannot advance in
spiritual life. Prahlada Maharaja also has said:
naisam matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo-'bhisekam
niskincananam na vrnita yavat
(Bhag. 7.5.32)
One should take shelter of a pure devotee, who has nothing to do with this material world but is simply
engaged in devotional service. By serving him only, one can transcend the qualitative material condition.
In this verse it is recommended (yogesvara-upasanaya) that one serve the lotus feet of the topmost yogi,
or the devotee. To serve the topmost devotee means to hear from him about the glories of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. To hear the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the mouth of a
pure devotee is to acquire a pious life. In Bhagavad-gita (7.28) it is also said that without being pious one
cannot engage in devotional service.
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajanti mam drdha-vratah
To become fixed in devotional service one has to become completely cleansed from the contamination
of the material modes of nature. For work in devotional service the first item is adau gurv-asrayam: one
should accept a bona fide spiritual master, and from the bona fide spiritual master inquire about one's
transcendental occupational duties (sad-dharma-prccha) and follow in the footsteps of great saintly
persons, devotees (sadhu-marga-anugamanam). These are the instructions given in Bhakti-rasamrtasindhu
by Rupa Gosvami.
The conclusion is that to increase attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead one has to accept
a bona fide spiritual master and learn from him the methods of devotional service and hear from him
about the transcendental message and glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way
one has to increase his conviction about devotional service. Then it will be very easy to increase
attachment for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
