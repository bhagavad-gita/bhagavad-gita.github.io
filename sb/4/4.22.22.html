<h2>Translation</h2>
There were various trees and creepers on all sides of the lake, and there were mad bumblebees
humming all about them. The trees appeared to be very jolly due to the sweet humming of the
bumblebees, and the saffron, which was contained in the lotus flowers, was being thrown into the air.
These all created such an atmosphere that it appeared as though a festival were taking place there.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Trees and creepers are also different types of living beings. When bumblebees come upon trees and
creepers to collect honey, certainly such plants become very happy. On such an occasion the wind also
takes advantage of the situation by throwing pollen or saffron contained in the lotus flowers. All this
combines with the sweet vibration created by the swans and the calm of the water. The Pracetas
considered such a place to be like a continuous festival. From this description it appears that the Pracetas
reached Sivaloka, which is supposed to be situated near the Himalaya Mountains.
