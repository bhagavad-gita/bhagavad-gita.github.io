<h2>Translation</h2>
Then the great hero, Vijitasva, the son of King Prthu, again took the horse and returned to his father's
sacrificial arena. Since that time, certain men with a poor fund of knowledge have adopted the dress of a
false sannyasi. It was King Indra who introduced this.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since time immemorial, the sannyasa order has carried the tridanda. Later Sankaracarya introduced the
ekadandi-sannyasa. A tridandi-sannyasi is a Vaisnava sannyasi, and an ekadandi-sannyasi is a Mayavadi
sannyasi. There are many other types of sannyasis, who are not approved by Vedic rituals. A type of
pseudo-sannyasa was introduced by Indra when he tried to hide himself from the attack of Vijitasva, the
great son of King Prthu. Now there are many different types of sannyasis. Some of them go naked, and
some of them carry a skull and trident, generally known as kapalika. All of them were introduced under
some meaningless circumstances, and those who have a poor fund of knowledge accept these false
sannyasis and their pretenses, although they are not bona fide guides to spiritual advancement. At the
present moment some missionary institutions, without referring to the Vedic rituals, have introduced
some sannyasis who engage in sinful activities. The sinful activities forbidden by the sastras are illicit sex,
intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. These so-called sannyasis indulge in all these activities. They eat
meat and flesh, fish, eggs and just about everything. They sometimes drink with the excuse that without
alcohol, fish and meat, it is impossible to remain in the cold countries near the Arctic zone. These
sannyasis introduce all these sinful activities in the name of serving the poor, and consequently poor
animals are cut to pieces and go into the bellies of these sannyasis. As described in the following verses,
such sannyasis are pakhandis. Vedic literature states that a person who puts Lord Narayana on the level
with Lord Siva or Lord Brahma immediately becomes a pakhandi. As stated in the Puranas:
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
In Kali-yuga the pakhandis are very prominent. However, Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has tried to
kill all these pakhandis by introducing His sankirtana movement. Those who take advantage of this
sankirtana movement of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness will be able to save
themselves from the influence of these pakhandis.
