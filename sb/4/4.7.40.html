narada uvaca
jananyabhihitah panthah
sa vai nihsreyasasya te
bhagavan vasudevas tam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
naradah uvaca--the great sage Narada said; jananya--by your mother; abhihitah--stated; panthah--the
path; sah--that; vai--certainly; nihsreyasasya--the ultimate goal of life; te--for you; bhagavan--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; vasudevah--Krsna; tam--unto Him; bhaja--render your service; tam--by Him;
pravana-atmana--fully absorbing your mind.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada told Dhruva Maharaja: The instruction given by your mother, Suniti, to follow
the path of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is just suitable for you. You should
therefore completely absorb yourself in the devotional service of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja's demand was to achieve an abode even greater than Lord Brahma's. Within this
universe, Lord Brahma is supposed to be in the most exalted position, for he is the chief of all demigods,
but Dhruva Maharaja wanted a realm beyond his. Therefore his desire was not to be fulfilled by
worshiping any demigod. As described in Bhagavad-gita, the benedictions offered by the demigods are all
temporary. Therefore Narada Muni asked Dhruva Maharaja to follow the path recommended by his
mother--to worship Krsna, Vasudeva. When Krsna offers anything, it is beyond the expectation of the
devotee. Both Suniti and Narada Muni knew that the demand of Dhruva Maharaja was impossible for any
demigod to fulfill, and therefore both of them recommended following the process of devotional service to
Lord Krsna.
Narada Muni is referred to here as bhagavan because he can bless any person just as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can. He was very pleased with Dhruva Maharaja, and he could have at once
personally given whatever he wanted, but that is not the duty of the spiritual master. His duty is to engage
the disciple in proper devotional service as prescribed in the sastras. Krsna was similarly present before
Arjuna, and even though He could have given him all facilities for victory over the opposing party without
a fight, He did not do so; instead He asked Arjuna to fight. In the same way, Narada Muni asked Dhruva
Maharaja to undergo devotional discipline in order to achieve the desired result.
