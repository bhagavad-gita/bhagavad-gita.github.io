<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are the supreme one, but by Your different energies You appear differently in the spiritual
and material worlds. You create the total energy of the material world by Your external potency, and after
creation You enter within the material world as the Supersoul. You are the Supreme Person, and through
the temporary modes of material nature You create varieties of manifestation, just as fire, entering into
wood of different shapes, burns brilliantly in different varieties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja realized that the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, acts through
His different energies, not that He becomes void or impersonal and thus becomes all-pervading. The
Mayavadi philosopher thinks that the Absolute Truth, being spread throughout the cosmic manifestation,
has no personal form. But here Dhruva Maharaja, upon realization of the Vedic conclusion, says, "You are
spread all over the cosmic manifestation by Your energy." This energy is basically spiritual, but because it
acts in the material world temporarily, it is called maya, or illusory energy. In other words, for everyone
but the devotees the Lord's energy acts as external energy. Dhruva Maharaja could understand this fact
very nicely, and he could understand also that the energy and the energetic are one and the same. The
energy cannot be separated from the energetic.
The identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the feature of Paramatma, or Supersoul, is
admitted herein. His original, spiritual energy enlivens the material energy, and thus the dead body
appears to have life force. Voidist philosophers think that under certain material conditions the symptoms
of life occur in the material body, but the fact is that the material body cannot act on its own. Even a
machine needs separate energy (electricity, steam, etc.). It is stated in this verse that the material energy
acts in varieties of material bodies, just as fire burns differently in different wood according to the size and
quality of the wood. In the case of devotees the same energy is transformed into spiritual energy; this is
possible because the energy is originally spiritual, not material. As it is said, visnu-saktih para prokta. The
original energy inspires a devotee, and thus he engages all his bodily limbs in the service of the Lord. The
same energy, as external potency, engages the ordinary nondevotees in material activities for sense
enjoyment. We should mark the difference between maya and sva-dhama--for devotees the sva-dhama
acts, whereas in the case of nondevotees the maya energy acts.
