<h2>Translation</h2>
Through austerity, King Malayadhvaja in body and mind gradually became equal to the dualities of cold
and heat, happiness and distress, wind and rain, hunger and thirst, the pleasant and the unpleasant. In
this way he conquered all relativities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Liberation means becoming free from the relativities of the world. Unless one is self-realized, he has to
undergo the dual struggle of the relative world. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advises Arjuna to conquer all
relativities through tolerance. Lord Krsna points out that it is the relativities like winter and summer that
give us trouble in the material world. In the winter we do not like taking a bath, but in the summer we
wish to take a bath twice, thrice or more a day. Thus Krsna advises us not to be disturbed by such
relativities and dualities when they come and go.
The common man has to undergo much austerity to become equipoised before dualities. One who
becomes agitated by the relativities of life has accepted a relative position and must therefore undergo the
austerities prescribed in the sastras to transcend the material body and put an end to material existence.
King Malayadhvaja underwent severe austerities by leaving his home, going to Kulacala, taking his bath in
the sacred rivers and eating only vegetables like stems, roots, seeds, flowers and leaves, avoiding any
cooked food or grains. These are very, very austere practices. In this age it is very difficult to leave home
and go to the forest or the Himalayas to adopt the processes of austerity. Indeed, it is almost impossible. If
one is even advised to give up meat-eating, drinking, gambling and illicit sex, one will fail to do so. What,
then, would a person do if he went to the Himalayas or Kulacala? Such acts of renunciation are not
possible in this age; therefore Lord Krsna has advised us to accept the bhakti-yoga process. Bhakti-yoga
will automatically liberate a person from the dualities of life. In bhakti-yoga, Krsna is the center, and
Krsna is always transcendental. Thus in order to transcend dualities, one must always engage in the
service of the Lord, as confirmed by Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."
If one is factually engaged in the service of the Lord, bhakti-yoga, he will automatically control his
senses, his tongue and so many other things. Once engaged in the bhakti-yoga process with all sincerity,
one will have no chance of falling down. Even if one falls down, there is no loss. One's devotional
activities may be stunned or choked for the time being, but as soon as there is another chance, the
practitioner begins from the point where he left off.
