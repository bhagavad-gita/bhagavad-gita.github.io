<h2>Text</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--there; avasistah--remaining; ye--which; vrksah--trees; bhitah--being afraid; duhitaram--their
daughter; tada--at that time; ujjahruh--delivered; te--they; pracetobhyah--unto the Pracetas; upadistah--
being advised; svayambhuva--by Lord Brahma.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The remaining trees, being very much afraid of the Pracetas, immediately delivered their daughter at the
advice of Lord Brahma.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The daughter of the trees is referred to in text 13 of this chapter. This daughter was born of Kandu and
Pramloca. The society girl Pramloca, after giving birth to the child, immediately left for the heavenly
kingdom. While the child was crying, the king of the moon took compassion upon her and saved her by
putting his finger into her mouth. This child was cared for by the trees, and when she grew up, by the
order of Lord Brahma, she was delivered to the Pracetas as their wife. The name of the girl was Marisa, as
the next verse will explain. It was the predominating deity of the trees that delivered the daughter. In this
connection, Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhupada states, vrksah tad-adhisthatr-devatah: "The 'trees' means the
controlling deity of those trees." In Vedic literatures we find that there is a controlling deity of the water;
similarly, there is a controlling deity of the trees. The Pracetas were engaged in burning all the trees to
ashes, and they considered the trees their enemies. To pacify the Pracetas, the predominating deity of the
trees, under the advice of Lord Brahma, delivered the daughter Marisa.
