<h2>Translation</h2>
King Indra said: My dear Lord, Your transcendental form with eight hands and weapons in each of them
appears for the welfare of the entire universe, and it is very pleasing to the mind and eyes. In such a form,
Your Lordship is always prepared to punish the demons, who are envious of Your devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is generally understood from revealed scriptures that Lord Visnu appears with four hands, but in this
particular sacrificial arena Lord Visnu arrived with eight hands. King Indra said, "Even though we are
accustomed to see Your four-handed Visnu form, this appearance with eight hands is as real as the fourhanded
form." As Lord Brahma had said, to realize the transcendental form of the Lord is beyond the
power of the senses. In reply to that statement by Brahma, King Indra said that even though the
transcendental form of the Lord is not perceivable by the material senses, His activities and His
transcendental form can be understood. The Lord's uncommon features, uncommon activities and
uncommon beauty can be perceived even by an ordinary man. For example, when Lord Krsna appeared
just like a six- or seven-year-old boy in Vrndavana, He was approached by the residents there. There were
torrents of rain, and the Lord saved the residents of Vrndavana by lifting Govardhana Hill and resting it
on the little finger of His left hand for seven days. This uncommon feature of the Lord should convince
even materialistic persons who want to speculate to the limit of their material senses. The activities of the
Lord are pleasing to experimental vision also, but impersonalists will not believe in His identity because
they study the personality of the Lord by comparing their personality to His. Because men in this material
world cannot lift a hill, they do not believe that the Lord can lift one. They accept the statements of
Srimad-Bhagavatam to be allegorical, and they try to interpret them in their own way. But factually the
Lord lifted the hill in the presence of all the inhabitants of Vrndavana, as corroborated by great acaryas
and authors like Vyasadeva and Narada. Everything about the Lord--His activities, pastimes and
uncommon features--should be accepted as is, and in this way, even in our present condition, we can
understand the Lord. ln the instance herein, King Indra confirmed: "Your presence with eight hands is as
good as Your presence with four hands." There is no doubt about it.
