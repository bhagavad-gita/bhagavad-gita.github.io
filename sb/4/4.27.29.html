<h2>Text</h2>
yenopasantir bhutanam
ksullakanam apihatam
antarhito 'ntar-hrdaye
kasman no veda nasisah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yena--by which process; upasantih--satisfaction of all desires; bhutanam--of the living entities;
ksullakanam--very much fallen; api--although; ihatam--desiring many things; antarhitah--hidden; antahhrdaye--
in the core of the heart; kasmat--why; nah--our; veda--He knows; na--not; asisah--desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Lord, out of His natural compassion, thinks of His devotee, by that process only are all desires
of the neophyte devotee fulfilled. The Lord is situated in every living entity's heart, although the living
entity may be very insignificant. The Lord knows everything about the living entity, including all his
desires. Although we are very insignificant, why should the Lord not know our desires?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A very advanced devotee does not think himself advanced. He is always very humble. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His plenary expansion as the Paramatma, or Supersoul, sits in everyone's heart
and can understand the attitudes and desires of His devotees. The Lord also gives opportunity to the
nondevotees to fulfill their desires, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca).
Whatever a living entity desires, however insignificant he may be, is noted by the Lord, who gives him a
chance to fulfill his desires. If the desires of the nondevotees are fulfilled, why not those of the devotee? A
pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without material desire, and if he wants
this within the core of his heart, where the Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why
should the Lord not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the arca-vigraha,
the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful because the Lord is present within his heart and
understands his sincerity. Thus if a devotee, with all confidence, goes on discharging the prescribed duties
of devotional service, he will ultimately attain success.
