<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, the seeds, roots, herbs and grains, which were created by Lord Brahma in the past, are
now being used by nondevotees, who are devoid of all spiritual understanding.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma created this material world for the use of the living entities, but it was created according to
a plan that all living entities who might come into it to dominate it for sense gratification would be given
directions by Lord Brahma in the Vedas in order that they might ultimately leave it and return home, back
to Godhead. All necessities grown on earth--namely fruits, flowers, trees, grains, animals and animal byproducts--
were created for use in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Visnu. However, the planet earth in the shape of a cow herein submits that all these utilities are being
used by nondevotees, who have no plans for spiritual understanding. Although there are immense
potencies within the earth for the production of grains, fruits and flowers, this production is checked by
the earth itself when it is misused by nondevotees, who have no spiritual goals. Everything belongs to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and everything can be used for His satisfaction. Things should not be
used for the sense gratification of the living entities. This is the whole plan of material nature according to
the directions of this material nature.
In this verse the words asadbhih and adhrta-vrataih are important. The word asadbhih refers to the
nondevotees. The nondevotees have been described in Bhagavad-gita as duskrtinah (miscreants), mudhah
(asses or rascals), naradhamah (lowest of mankind) and mayayapahrta-jnanah (those who have lost their
knowledge to the power of the illusory energy). All these persons are asat, nondevotees. Nondevotees are
also called grha-vrata, whereas the devotee is called dhrta-vrata. The whole Vedic plan is that the
misguided conditioned souls who have come to lord it over material nature should be trained to become
dhrta-vrata. This means that they should take a vow to satisfy their senses or enjoy material life only by
satisfying the senses of the Supreme Lord. Activities intended to satisfy the senses of the Supreme Lord,
Krsna, are called krsnarthe 'khila-cestah. This indicates that one can attempt all kinds of work, but one
should do so to satisfy Krsna. This is described in Bhagavad-gita as yajnarthat karma. The word yajna
indicates Lord Visnu. We should work only for His satisfaction. In modern times (Kali-yuga), however,
people have forgotten Visnu altogether, and they conduct their activities for sense gratification. Such
people will gradually become poverty-stricken, for they cannot use things which are to be enjoyed by the
Supreme Lord for their own sense gratification. If they continue like this, there will ultimately be a state of
poverty, and no grains, fruits or flowers will be produced. Indeed, it is stated in the Twelfth Canto of
Bhagavatam that at the end of Kali-yuga people will be so polluted that there will no longer be any grains,
wheat, sugarcane or milk.
