<h2>Text</h2>
evam karmasu samsaktah
kamatma vancito 'budhah
mahisi yad yad iheta
tat tad evanvavartata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; karmasu--in fruitive activities; samsaktah--being too much attached; kama-atma--lusty;
vancitah--cheated; abudhah--less intelligent; mahisi--the Queen; yat yat--whatsoever; iheta--she would
desire; tat tat--all of that; eva--certainly; anvavartata--he followed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being thus entangled in different types of mental concoction and engaged in fruitive activities, King
Puranjana came completely under the control of material intelligence and was thus cheated. Indeed, he
used to fulfill all the desires of his wife, the Queen.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a living entity is in such bewilderment that he is under the control of his wife, or material
intelligence, he has to satisfy the intelligence of his so-called wife and act exactly according to her
dictates. Various sastras advise that for material convenience one should keep his wife always satisfied by
giving her ornaments and by following her instructions. In this way there will be no trouble in family life.
Therefore for one's own social benefit, one is advised to keep his wife satisfied. In this way, when one
becomes the servant of his wife, he must act according to the desires of his wife. Thus one becomes more
and more entangled. In Bengal it is said that if one becomes an obedient servant of his wife, he loses all
reputation. However, the difficulty is that unless one becomes a most obedient servant of his wife, family
life becomes disturbed. In the Western countries this disturbance gives rise to the divorce law, and in
Eastern countries like India there is separation. Now this disturbance is confirmed by the new
introduction of the divorce law in India. Within the heart, the mind is acting, thinking, feeling and
willing, and falling under the control of one's wife is the same as falling under the control of material
intelligence. Thus one begets children by his wife and becomes entangled in so many activities under the
control of mental concoctions.
