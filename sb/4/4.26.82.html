<h2>Translation</h2>
Having undergone austerities and penances at Kapilasrama, King Pracinabarhi attained full liberation
from all material designations. He constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and
attained a spiritual position qualitatively equal to that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is special significance in the words tat-samyatam agat. The King attained the position of
possessing the same status or the same form as that of the Lord. This definitely proves that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is always a person. In His impersonal feature, He is the rays of His transcendental
body. When a living entity attains spiritual perfection, he also attains the same type of body, known as
sac-cid-ananda-vigraha. This spiritual body never mixes with the material elements. Although in
conditional life the living entity is surrounded by material elements (earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind,
intelligence and ego), he remains always aloof from them. In other words, the living entity can be
liberated from the material condition at any moment, provided that he wishes to do so. The material
environment is called maya. According to Krsna:
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." (Bg. 7.14)
As soon as the living entity engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he immediately
attains freedom from all material conditions (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). In the
material state the living entity is on the jiva-bhuta platform, but when he renders devotional service to the
Lord, he is elevated to the brahma-bhuta platform. On the brahma-bhuta platform the living entity is
liberated from material bondage, and he engages in the service of the Lord. In this verse the word dhira is
sometimes read as vira. Actually there is not very much difference. The word dhira means "sober," and
vira means "hero." One who is struggling against maya is a hero, and one who is sober enough to
understand his position is a dhira. Without becoming sober or heroic, one cannot attain spiritual
salvation.
