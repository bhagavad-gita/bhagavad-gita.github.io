<br>

with a desire to purify; bhitasya--to the materialistic person who is always fearful; kim--why; na--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, Your personal associates, devotees, wander all over the world to purify even the holy places
of pilgrimage. Is not such activity pleasing to those who are actually afraid of material existence?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are two kinds of devotees. One is called gosthanandi and the other bhajananandi. The word
bhajananandi refers to the devotee who does not move, but remains in one place. Such a devotee is always
engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He chants the maha-mantra as taught by many acaryas and
sometimes goes out for preaching work. The gosthanandi is one who desires to increase the number of
devotees all over the world. He travels all over the world just to purify the world and the people residing
in it. Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised:
prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted His followers to move all over the world to preach in every town
and village. In the Caitanya-sampradaya those who strictly follow the principles of Lord Caitanya must
travel all over the world to preach the message of Lord Caitanya, which is the same as preaching the
words of Krsna--Bhagavad-gita--and Srimad-Bhagavatam. The more the devotees preach the principles of
krsna-katha, the more people throughout the world will benefit.
Devotees like the great sage Narada, who travel all over to preach, are called gosthanandi. Narada Muni
is always wandering throughout the universe just to create different types of devotees. Narada even made
a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Maharaja and Prahlada devotees. Actually, all devotees are
indebted to the great sage Narada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord
is not even afraid of hell. He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere--even in hell--because
there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee.
narayana-parah sarve
na kutascana bibhyati
svargapavarga-narakesv
api tulyartha-darsinah
"A pure devotee of Narayana is never afraid of going anywhere and everywhere. For him heaven and
hell are one and the same." (Bhag. 6.17.28) Such devotees, wandering all over the world, deliver those
who are actually afraid of this material existence. Some people are already disgusted with material
existence, being confused and frustrated by material enjoyment, and some people, who are intelligent, are
interested in understanding the Supreme Lord. Both may take advantage of the pure devotee who wanders
throughout the world.
When a pure devotee goes to a place of pilgrimage, he desires to purify that holy place of pilgrimage.
Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters
of the Ganges and Yamuna at places such as Prayaga, Vrndavana and Mathura. In this way the sinful men
are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee
comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are
neutralized by the devotee. Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gada-bhrta (Bhag. 1.13.10). Because
the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes
becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is
therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material
contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to
deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of maya.
