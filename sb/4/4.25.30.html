<h2>Text</h2>
tasyam sa janayam cakra
atmajam asiteksanam
yaviyasah sapta sutan
sapta dravida-bhubhrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasyam--through her; sah--the King; janayam cakre--begot; atmajam--daughter; asita--blue or black;
iksanam--whose eyes; yaviyasah--younger, very powerful; sapta--seven; sutan--sons; sapta--seven;
dravida--province of Dravida, or South India; bhu--of the land; bhrtah--kings.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Malayadhvaja fathered one daughter, who had very black eyes. He also had seven sons, who later
became rulers of that tract of land known as Dravida. Thus there were seven kings in that land.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Malayadhvaja was a great devotee, and after he married the daughter of King Vidarbha, he gave her
one nice daughter, whose eyes were black. Figuratively this means that the daughter of King
Malayadhvaja was also bestowed with devotional service, for her eyes were always fixed on Krsna. A
devotee has no vision in his life other than Krsna. The seven sons are the seven processes of devotional
service--hearing, chanting, remembering, offering worship, offering prayers, rendering transcendental
loving service and serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Of the nine types of devotional service, only seven
were immediately given. The balance--friendship and surrendering everything--were to be developed later.
In other words, devotional service is divided into two categories--namely vidhi-marga and raga-marga.
The process of becoming friends with the Lord and sacrificing everything for Him belongs to the category
of raga-marga, the stage of developed devotional service. For the neophyte, the important processes are
those of hearing and chanting (sravanam kirtanam), remembering Krsna, worshiping the Deity in the
temple, offering prayers and always engaging in the service of the Lord, and worshiping the lotus feet of
the Lord.
The word yaviyasah indicates that these processes are very powerful. After a devotee engages in the
processes of sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam, and is able
to secure these processes, he can later become a devotee capable of rendering spontaneous devotional
service--namely sakhyam and atma-nivedanam. Generally the great acaryas who preach devotional service
all over the world belong to the category of sakhyam atma-nivedanam. A neophyte devotee cannot
actually become a preacher. The neophyte is advised to execute devotional service in the seven other
fields (sravanam kirtanam, etc.). If one can successfully execute the preliminary seven items, he can in the
future be situated on the platform of sakhyam atma-nivedanam.
The specific mention of Dravida-desa refers to the five Dravida-desas in South India. All are very strong
in rendering the preliminary devotional processes (sravanam kirtanam). Some great acaryas, like
Ramanujacarya and Madhvacarya, also came from Dravida-desa and became great preachers. They were
all situated on the platform of sakhyam atma-nivedanam.
