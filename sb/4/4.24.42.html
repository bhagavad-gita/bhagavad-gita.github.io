<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are the topmost of all bestowers of all benediction, the oldest and supreme enjoyer
amongst all enjoyers. You are the master of all the worlds' metaphysical philosophy, for You are the
supreme cause of all causes, Lord Krsna. You are the greatest of all religious principles, the supreme mind,
and You have a brain which is never checked by any condition. Therefore I repeatedly offer my obeisances
unto You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words krsnaya akuntha-medhase are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their
brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any
brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called anu, an atomic
particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited
knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, has a limited
brain. What Krsna says and does is not limited by time and space. In Bhagavad-gita (7.26) the Lord says:
vedaham samatitani
vartamanani carjuna
bhavisyani ca bhutani
mam tu veda na kascana
"O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all
that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me
no one knows."
Krsna knows everything, but one cannot know Krsna without being favored by Him. Thus for Krsna
and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What Krsna says is all perfect and
certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows
exactly what Krsna says. The Krsna consciousness movement is based on Bhagavad-gita as it is, as spoken
by Lord Krsna, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty.
Lord Krsna is also addressed herein as asisam isa. The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are
able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Krsna, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else.
The word manave, meaning "unto the supreme Manu," is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic
literature is Svayambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Krsna. All the Manus are empowered
incarnations of Krsna (manvantara-avatara). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma, 420 in one
month, all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Krsna is the supreme director of human
society. In another sense, the word manave indicates the perfection of all kinds of mantras. The mantra
delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the mantra Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance
from any condition.
Karanatmane: everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because
everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are
unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In Brahma-samhita
Krsna is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as karanatmane. His very
personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As
described in the Vedanta-sutra (1.1.2), janmady asya yatah: the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all
emanations.
The word sankhya-yogesvaraya is also significant herein, for Krsna is described in Bhagavad-gita as
Yogesvara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot
be accepted as God. In this age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim
to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Krsna is the Supreme Person who
possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The sankhya-yoga system popular at the present moment was
propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original sankhya-yoga system was propounded by an
incarnation of Krsna also named Kapila, the son of Devahuti. Similarly, Dattatreya, another incarnation of
Krsna, also explained the sankhya-yoga system. Thus Krsna is the origin of all sankhya-yoga systems and
mystic yoga powers.
The words purusaya puranaya are also worthy of special attention. In Brahma-samhita, Krsna is
accepted as the adi-purusa, the original person, or the original enjoyer. In Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna is
also accepted as purana-purusa, the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also
the youngest of all, or nava-yauvana. Another significant word is dharmaya. Since Krsna is the original
propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam (Bhag.
6.3.19). No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established
by Lord Krsna. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna informs us of the original dharma and asks us to give up all kinds
of religious principles. The real dharma is surrender unto Him. In the Mahabharata, it is also said:
ye ca veda-vido vipra
ye cadhyatma-vido janah
te vadanti mahatmanam
krsnam dharmam sanatanam
The purport is that one who has studied the Vedas perfectly, who is a perfect vipra, or knower of the
Vedas, who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about Krsna, the Supreme Person, as one's
sanatana-dharma. Lord Siva therefore teaches us the principles of sanatana-dharma.
