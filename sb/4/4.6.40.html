sa tupalabhyagatam atma-yonim
surasuresair abhivanditanghrih
utthaya cakre sirasabhivandanam
arhattamah kasya yathaiva visnuh
SYNONYMS
sah--Lord Siva; tu--but; upalabhya--seeing; agatam--had arrived; atma-yonim--Lord Brahma; sura-asuraisaih--
by the best of the demigods and demons; abhivandita-anghrih--whose feet are worshiped; utthaya--
standing up; cakre--made; sirasa--with his head; abhivandanam--respectful; arhattamah--Vamanadeva;
kasya--of Kasyapa; yatha eva--just as; visnuh--Visnu.
TRANSLATION
Lord Siva's lotus feet were worshiped by both the demigods and demons, but still, in spite of his exalted
position, as soon as he saw that Lord Brahma was there among all the other demigods, he immediately
stood up and offered him respect by bowing down and touching his lotus feet, just as Vamanadeva offered
His respectful obeisances to Kasyapa Muni.
PURPORT
Kasyapa Muni was in the category of the living entities, but he had a transcendental son, Vamanadeva,
who was an incarnation of Visnu. Thus although Lord Visnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He
offered His respects to Kasyapa Muni. Similarly, when Lord Krsna was a child He used to offer His
respectful obeisances to His mother and father, Nanda and Yasoda. Also, at the Battle of Kuruksetra, Lord
Krsna touched the feet of Maharaja Yudhisthira because the King was His elder. It appears, then, that the
Personality of Godhead, Lord Siva and other devotees, in spite of their being situated in exalted positions,
instructed by practical example how to offer obeisances to their superiors. Lord Siva offered his respectful
obeisances to Brahma because Brahma was his father, just as Kasyapa Muni was the father of Vamana.
