<h2>Text</h2>
narada uvaca
sainika bhaya-namno ye
barhisman dista-karinah
prajvara-kala-kanyabhyam
vicerur avanim imam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
naradah uvaca--the great sage Narada continued to speak; sainikah--the soldiers; bhaya-namnah--of
Bhaya (Fear); ye--all of them who; barhisman--O King Pracinabarhisat; dista-karinah--the order carriers of
death; prajvara--with Prajvara; kala-kanyabhyam--and with Kalakanya; viceruh--traveled; avanim--on
earth; imam--this.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King Pracinabarhisat, afterward, the King of the Yavanas,
whose name is fear itself, as well as Prajvara, Kalakanya, and his soldiers, began to travel all over the
world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The period of life just prior to death is certainly very dangerous because usually at this time people are
attacked by the weakness of old age as well as many kinds of disease. The diseases that attack the body are
compared here to soldiers. These soldiers are not ordinary soldiers, for they are guided by the King of the
Yavanas, who acts as their commander-in-chief. The word dista-karinah indicates that he is their
commander. When a man is young, he does not care for old age, but enjoys sex to the best of his
satisfaction, not knowing that at the end of life his sexual indulgence will bring on various diseases, which
so much disturb the body that one will pray for immediate death. The more one enjoys sex during youth,
the more he suffers in old age.
