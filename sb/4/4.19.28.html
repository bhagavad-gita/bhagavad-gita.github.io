<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord of the universe, the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is the mother of the universe, and yet I
think that she may be angry with me because of my intruding upon her service and acting on that very
platform to which she is so much attached. Yet I am hopeful that even though there is some
misunderstanding, You will take my part, for You are very much inclined to the poor and You always
magnify even insignificant service unto You. Therefore even though she becomes angry, I think that there
is no harm for You, because You are so self-sufficient that You can do without her.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mother Laksmiji, the goddess of fortune, is well known for always massaging the lotus feet of Lord
Narayana. She is an ideal wife because she takes care of Lord Narayana in every detail. She takes care not
only of His lotus feet but of the household affairs of the Lord as well. She cooks nice foods for Him, fans
Him while He eats, smoothes sandalwood pulp on His face and sets His bed and sitting places in the right
order. In this way she is always engaged in the service of the Lord, and there is hardly any opportunity for
any other devotee to intrude upon His daily activities. Prthu Maharaja was therefore almost certain that
his intrusion into the service of the goddess of fortune would irritate her and cause her to become angry
with him. But why should mother Laksmi, the mother of the universe, be angry with an insignificant
devotee like Prthu Maharaja? All this was not very likely. Yet Prthu Maharaja, just for his personal
protection, appealed to the Lord to take his part. Prthu Maharaja was engaged in performing the ordinary
Vedic rituals and sacrifices according to karma-kanda, or fruitive activities, but the Lord, being so kind
and magnanimous, was ready to award Prthu Maharaja the highest perfectional stage of life, namely
devotional service.
When a person performs Vedic rituals and sacrifices, he does so to elevate himself to the heavenly
planets. No one can become qualified to go back home, back to Godhead, by means of such sacrifices. But
the Lord is so kind that He accepts a little insignificant service, and therefore it is stated in the Visnu
purana that by following the principles of varnasrama-dharma one can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When
the Lord is satisfied, the performer of sacrifices is elevated to the platform of devotional service. Prthu
Maharaja therefore expected that his insignificant service to the Lord would be accepted by Him as being
greater than that of Laksmiji. The goddess of fortune is called cancala ("restless") because she is very
restless and is always coming and going. So Prthu Maharaja indicated that even though she might go away
out of anger, there would be no harm for Lord Visnu, because He is self-sufficient and can do anything
and everything without the help of Laksmiji. For example, when Garbhodakasayi Visnu begot Lord
Brahma from His navel, He did not take any help from Laksmi, who was just sitting by Him and
massaging His lotus feet. Generally if a son is to be begotten, the husband impregnates the wife, and in
due course of time the son is born. But in the case of Lord Brahma's birth, Garbhodakasayi Visnu did not
impregnate Laksmiji. Being self-sufficient, the Lord begot Brahma from His own navel. Therefore, Prthu
Maharaja was confident that even if the goddess of fortune became angry with him there would be no
harm, neither to the Lord nor to himself.
