<h2>Text</h2>
ma vah padavyah pitar asmad-asthita
ya yajna-salasu na dhuma-vartmabhih
tad-anna-trptair asu-bhrdbhir idita
avyakta-linga avadhuta-sevitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ma--are not; vah--yours; padavyah--opulences; pitah--O father; asmat-asthitah--possessed by us; yah--
which (opulences); yajna-salasu--in the sacrificial fire; na--not; dhuma-vartmabhih--by the path of
sacrifices; tat-anna-trptaih--satisfied by the foodstuff of the sacrifice; asu-bhrdbhih--satisfying bodily
necessities; iditah--praised; avyakta-lingah--whose cause is unmanifested; avadhuta-sevitah--achieved by
the self-realized souls.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear father, the opulence we possess is impossible for either you or your flatterers to imagine, for
persons who engage in fruitive activities by performing great sacrifices are concerned with satisfying their
bodily necessities by eating foodstuff offered as a sacrifice. We can exhibit our opulences simply by
desiring to do so. This can be achieved only by great personalities who are renounced, self-realized souls.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sati's father was under the impression that he was exalted in both prestige and opulence and that he had
offered his daughter to a person who was not only poor but devoid of all culture. Her father might have
been thinking that although she was a chaste woman, greatly adherent to her husband, her husband was
in a deplorable condition. To counteract such thoughts, Sati said that the opulence possessed by her
husband could not be understood by materialistic persons like Daksa and his followers, who were
flatterers and were engaged in fruitive activities. Her husband's position was different. He possessed all
opulences, but he did not like to exhibit them. Therefore such opulences are called avyakta, or
unmanifested. But if required, simply by willing, Lord Siva can show his wonderful opulences, and such
an event is predicted here, for it would soon occur. The opulence Lord Siva possesses is enjoyable in
renunciation and love of God, not in material exhibition of sense gratificatory methods. Such opulences
are possessed by personalities like the Kumaras, Narada and Lord Siva, not by others.
In this verse the performers of the Vedic rituals are condemned. They have been described here as
dhuma-vartmabhih, those who maintain themselves on the remnants of sacrificial foodstuff. There are two
kinds of foodstuff offered in sacrifice. One kind is food offered in fruitive ritualistic sacrifices, and the
other, the best, is food offered to Visnu. Although in all cases Visnu is the chief Deity on the sacrificial
altar, the performers of fruitive rituals aim to satisfy various demigods to achieve in return some material
prosperity. Real sacrifice, however, is to satisfy Lord Visnu, and the remnants of such sacrifices are
beneficial for advancement in devotional service. The process of elevation by performing sacrifices other
than those aimed at Visnu is very slow, and therefore it has been condemned in this verse. Visvanatha
Cakravarti has described the ritualistic performers to be like crows because crows delight in eating the
remnants of food which has been thrown into the dustbin. All the brahmanas who were present for the
sacrifice were also condemned by Sati.
Whether or not King Daksa and his flatterers could understand the position of Lord Siva, Sati wanted to
impress upon her father that he should not think her husband to be without opulence. Sati, being the
devoted wife of Lord Siva, offers all kinds of material opulences to the worshipers of Lord Siva. This fact is
explained in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, in the Tenth Canto. Lord Siva's worshipers sometimes appear more
opulent than the worshipers of Lord Visnu because Durga, or Sati, being the superintendent in charge of
material affairs, can offer all material opulences to the worshipers of Lord Siva in order to glorify her
husband, whereas the worshipers of Visnu are meant for spiritual elevation, and therefore their material
opulence is sometimes found to decrease. These points are very nicely discussed in the Tenth Canto.
