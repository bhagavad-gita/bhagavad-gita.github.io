<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Pracinabarhisat, the sons of Malayadhvaja gave birth to many thousands and thousands of
sons, and all of these have been protecting the entire world up to the end of one Manu's life-span and
even afterward.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahma. A manvantara, the life-span of one Manu, is given as 71
multiplied by 4,320,000 years. After one such Manu passes on, another Manu begins his life-span. In this
way the life cycle of the universe is going on. As one Manu follows another, the cult of Krsna
consciousness is being imparted, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.1):
sri-bhagavan uvaca
imam vivasvate yogam
proktavan aham avyayam
vivasvan manave praha
manur iksvakave 'bravit
"The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and
Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku."
Vivasvan, the sun-god, imparted Bhagavad-gita to one Manu, and this Manu imparted it to his son, who
imparted it to yet another Manu. In this way the propagation of Krsna consciousness is never stopped. No
one should think that this Krsna consciousness movement is a new movement. As confirmed by
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is a very, very old movement, for it has been passing down from
one Manu to another.
Among Vaisnavas there may be some difference of opinion due to everyone's personal identity, but
despite all personal differences, the cult of Krsna consciousness must go on. We can see that under the
instructions of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja began
preaching the Krsna consciousness movement in an organized way within the past hundred years. The
disciples of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja are all Godbrothers, and although there are
some differences of opinion, and although we are not acting conjointly, every one of us is spreading this
Krsna consciousness movement according to his own capacity and producing many disciples to spread it
all over the world. As far as we are concerned, we have already started the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, and many thousands of Europeans and Americans have joined this movement.
Indeed, it is spreading like wildfire. The cult of Krsna consciousness, based on the nine principles of
devotional service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam), will never be stopped. It will go on without distinction of caste, creed, color
or country. No one can check it.
The word bhoksyate is very important in this verse. Just as a king gives protection to his citizens, these
devotees, following the principles of devotional service, will give protection to all the people of the world.
The people of the world are very much harassed by so-called religious-principled svamis, yogis, karmis
and jnanis, but none of these can show the right way to become elevated to the spiritual platform. There
are primarily four parties spreading devotional service all over the universe. These are the Ramanujasampradaya,
the Madhva-sampradaya, the Visnusvami-sampradaya and the Nimbarka-sampradaya. The
Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya in particular comes from Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. All these devotees are
spreading this Krsna consciousness movement very widely and giving protection to innocent people who
are being so much embarrassed by pseudo-avataras, -svamis, -yogis and others.
