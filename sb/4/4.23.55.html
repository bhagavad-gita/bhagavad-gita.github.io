<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes he used to go to his private home with one of his chief servants [the mind], who was named
Visucina. At that time, illusion, satisfaction and happiness used to be produced from his wife and
children.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic conclusion, one's self is situated within the heart. As stated in Vedic language,
hrdy ayam atma pratisthitah: the self is situated within the heart. In the material condition, however, the
spirit soul is covered by the material qualities--namely goodness, passion and darkness--and within the
heart these three qualities react. For instance, when one is in goodness, he feels happiness; when one is in
passion, he feels satisfaction through material enjoyment; and when one is in darkness, he feels
bewilderment. All these activities are of the mind, and they function on the platform of thinking, feeling
and willing.
When the living entity is encircled by wife, children and home, he acts on the mental plane. Sometimes
he is very happy, sometimes he is very much satisfied, sometimes he is not satisfied, and sometimes he is
bewildered. Bewilderment is called moha, illusion. Illusioned by society, friendship and love, the living
entity thinks that his so-called society, friendship and love, nationality, community, etc. will give him
protection. He does not know that after death he will be thrown into the hands of a very strong material
nature that will force him to accept a certain type of body according to his present work. This body may
not even be a human body. Thus the living entity's feeling of security in this life in the midst of society,
wife and friendship is nothing but illusion. All living entities encaged in various material bodies are
illusioned by the present activities of material enjoyment. They forget their real business, which is to go
back home, back to Godhead.
Everyone who is not in Krsna consciousness must be considered to be in illusion. One's so-called
feelings of happiness and satisfaction resulting from material things are also illusions. Factually neither
society, friendship, love nor anything else can save one from the onslaught of the external energy, which
is symptomized by birth, death, old age and disease. To get even one living entity out of the illusory
condition is very difficult; therefore Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.
But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it." Therefore, unless one surrenders
completely at the lotus feet of Krsna, he cannot get out of the entanglement of the three modes of material
nature.
