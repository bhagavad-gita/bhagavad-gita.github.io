<h2>Text</h2>
prajvaro 'yam mama bhrata
tvam ca me bhagini bhava
caramy ubhabhyam loke 'sminn
avyakto bhima-sainikah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prajvarah--named Prajvara; ayam--this; mama--my; bhrata--brother; tvam--you; ca--also; me--my;
bhagini--sister; bhava--become; carami--I shall go about; ubhabhyam--by both of you; loke--in the world;
asmin--this; avyaktah--without being manifest; bhima--dangerous; sainikah--with soldiers.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King of the Yavanas continued: Here is my brother Prajvara. I now accept you as my sister. I shall
employ both of you, as well as my dangerous soldiers, to act imperceptibly within this world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kalakanya was sent by Narada Muni to Yavana-raja so that she might become his wife, but instead of
accepting her as his wife, Yavana-raja accepted her as his sister. Those who do not follow the Vedic
principles are unrestricted as far as sex life is concerned. Consequently they sometimes do not hesitate to
have sex with their sisters. In this age of Kali there are many instances of such incest. Although Yavanaraja
accepted the request of Narada Muni to show respect to him, he was nonetheless thinking of illicit
sex. This was due to his being the King of the yavanas and mlecchas.
The word prajvarah is very significant, for it means "the fever sent by Lord Visnu." Such a fever is
always set at 107 degrees, the temperature at which a man dies. Thus the King of the mlecchas and
yavanas requested the daughter of Time, Kalakanya, to become his sister. There was no need to ask her to
become his wife, for the yavanas and mlecchas do not make distinctions as far as sex life is concerned.
Thus one may outwardly be a sister, mother or daughter and still have sex. Yavana-raja's brother was
Prajvara, and Kalakanya was invalidity itself. Combined and strengthened by the soldiers of Yavana-raja--
namely nonhygienic conditions, illicit sex and ultimately a high degree of temperature to bring on death--
they would be able to smash the materialistic way of life. In this connection it is significant that Narada
was immune to the attack of jara, or invalidity, and similarly jara, or the destructive force, cannot attack
any follower of Narada Muni or a pure Vaisnava.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Attack by Candavega on the City of King Puranjana; the Character of Kalakanya."
