<h2>Text</h2>
anena puruso dehan
upadatte vimuncati
harsam sokam bhayam duhkham
sukham canena vindati
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anena--by this process; purusah--the living entity; dehan--gross bodies; upadatte--achieves; vimuncati--
gives up; harsam--enjoyment; sokam--lamentation; bhayam--fear; duhkham--unhappiness; sukham--
happiness; ca--also; anena--by the gross body; vindati--enjoys.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By virtue of the processes of the subtle body, the living entity develops and gives up gross bodies. This is
known as the transmigration of the soul. Thus the soul becomes subjected to different types of so-called
enjoyment, lamentation, fear, happiness and unhappiness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to this explanation, one can clearly understand that originally the living entity was as good as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his pure, spiritual existence. However, when the mind becomes
polluted by desires for sense gratification in the material world, the living entity drops into the material
conditions, as explained in this verse. Thus he begins his material existence, which means that he
transmigrates from one body to another and becomes more and more entangled in material existence. The
process of Krsna consciousness, by which one always thinks of Krsna, is the transcendental process by
which one can revert to his original, spiritual existence. Devotional service means always thinking of
Krsna.
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo 'si me
"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you
will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend." (Bg. 18.65)
One should always engage in the Lord's devotional service. As recommended in the arcana-marga, one
should worship the Deity in the temple and constantly offer obeisances to the spiritual master and the
Deity. These processes are recommended to one who actually wants to become free from material
entanglement. Modern psychologists can study the actions of the mind--thinking, feeling and willing--but
they are unable to go deep into the matter. This is due to their lack of knowledge and to their not being
associated with a liberated acarya.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.2):
evam parampara-praptam
imam rajarsayo viduh
sa kaleneha mahata
yogo nastah parantapa
"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings
understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it
is appears to be lost." Guided by so-called psychologists and philosophers, people in the modern age do
not know of the activities of the subtle body and thus cannot understand what is meant by the
transmigration of the soul. In these matters we have to take the authorized statements of Bhagavad-gita
(2.13):
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
Unless all human society understands this important verse in Bhagavad-gita, civilization will advance in
ignorance, not in knowledge.
TEXTS 76-77

<h2>Text</h2>
yatha trna-jalukeyam

na tyajen mriyamano 'pi
prag-dehabhimatim janah

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as; trna-jaluka--caterpillar; iyam--this; na apayati --does not go; apayati--goes; ca--also; na--not;
tyajet--gives up; mriyamanah--at the point of death; api--even; prak--former; deha--with the body;
abhimatim--identification; janah--a person; yavat--so long as; anyam--another; na--not; vindeta--obtains;
vyavadhanena--by the termination; karmanam--of fruitive activities; manah--the mind; eva--certainly;
manusya-indra--O ruler of men; bhutanam--of all living entities; bhava--of material existence; bhavanam--
the cause.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The caterpillar transports itself from one leaf to another by capturing one leaf before giving up the
other. Similarly, according to his previous work, the living entity must capture another body before giving
up the one he has. This is because the mind is the reservoir of all kinds of desires.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A living entity too much absorbed in material activity becomes very much attracted to the material
body. Even at the point of death, he thinks of his present body and the relatives connected to it. Thus he
remains fully absorbed in the bodily conception of life, so much so that even at the point of death he
abhors leaving his present body. Sometimes it is found that a person on the verge of death remains in a
coma for many days before giving up the body. This is common among so-called leaders and politicians
who think that without their presence the entire country and all society will be in chaos. This is called
maya. Political leaders do not like to leave their political posts, and they either have to be shot by an
enemy or obliged to leave by the arrival of death. By superior arrangement a living entity is offered
another body, but because of his attraction to the present body, he does not like to transfer himself to
another body. Thus he is forced to accept another body by the laws of nature.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27)
Material nature is very strong, and the material modes force one to accept another body. This force is
visible when the living entity transmigrates from a superior body to an inferior one. One who acts like a
dog or hog in the present body will certainly be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog in the next life.
A person may be enjoying the body of a prime minister or a president, but when he understands that he
will be forced to accept the body of a dog or hog, he chooses not to leave the present body. Therefore he
lies in a coma many days before death. This has been experienced by many politicians at the time of
death. The conclusion is that the next body is already determined by superior control. The living entity
immediately gives up the present body and enters another. Sometimes in the present body the living
entity feels that many of his desires and imaginations are not fulfilled. Those who are overly attracted to
their life situation are forced to remain in a ghostly body and are not allowed to accept another gross
body. Even in the body of a ghost, they create disturbances for neighbors and relatives. The mind is the
prime cause of such a situation. According to one's mind, different types of bodies are generated, and one
is forced to accept them. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (8.6):
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail."
Within one's body and mind, one can think as either a dog or a god, and the next life is offered to him
accordingly. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (13.22):
purusah prakrti-stho hi
bhunkte prakrtijan gunan
karanam guna-sango 'sya
sad-asad-yoni-janmasu
"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.
This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil among various
species." The living entity may transmigrate to either a superior or inferior body according to his
association with the modes of material nature. If he associates with the mode of ignorance, he gets the
body of an animal or an inferior man, but if he associates with the mode of goodness or passion, he gets a
body accordingly. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.18):
urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha
madhye tisthanti rajasah
jaghanya-guna-vrtti-stha
adho gacchanti tamasah
"Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode
of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds."
The root cause of one's association is the mind. This great Krsna consciousness movement is the
greatest boon to human society because it is teaching everyone to think always of Krsna by executing
devotional service. In this way, at the end of life, one may be transferred to the association of Krsna. This
is technically called nitya-lila-pravista, entering into the planet Goloka Vrndavana. Bhagavad-gita (18.55)
explains:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in
full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God." After
the mind is completely absorbed in Krsna consciousness, one can enter the planet known as Goloka
Vrndavana. To enter the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has to understand Krsna.
The process of understanding Krsna is devotional service.
After understanding Krsna as He is, one can become eligible to enter Krsnaloka and associate with Him.
The mind is the cause of such an exalted position. The mind can also get one a body like those of dogs
and hogs. To absorb the mind always in Krsna consciousness is therefore the greatest perfection of human
life.
