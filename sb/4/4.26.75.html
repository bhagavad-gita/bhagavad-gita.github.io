<h2>Text</h2>
anena puruso dehan
upadatte vimuncati
harsam sokam bhayam duhkham
sukham canena vindati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anena--by this process; purusah--the living entity; dehan--gross bodies; upadatte--achieves; vimuncati--
gives up; harsam--enjoyment; sokam--lamentation; bhayam--fear; duhkham--unhappiness; sukham--
happiness; ca--also; anena--by the gross body; vindati--enjoys.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By virtue of the processes of the subtle body, the living entity develops and gives up gross bodies. This is
known as the transmigration of the soul. Thus the soul becomes subjected to different types of so-called
enjoyment, lamentation, fear, happiness and unhappiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to this explanation, one can clearly understand that originally the living entity was as good as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his pure, spiritual existence. However, when the mind becomes
polluted by desires for sense gratification in the material world, the living entity drops into the material
conditions, as explained in this verse. Thus he begins his material existence, which means that he
transmigrates from one body to another and becomes more and more entangled in material existence. The
process of Krsna consciousness, by which one always thinks of Krsna, is the transcendental process by
which one can revert to his original, spiritual existence. Devotional service means always thinking of
Krsna.
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo 'si me
"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you
will come to Me without fail. I promise you this because you are My very dear friend." (Bg. 18.65)
One should always engage in the Lord's devotional service. As recommended in the arcana-marga, one
should worship the Deity in the temple and constantly offer obeisances to the spiritual master and the
Deity. These processes are recommended to one who actually wants to become free from material
entanglement. Modern psychologists can study the actions of the mind--thinking, feeling and willing--but
they are unable to go deep into the matter. This is due to their lack of knowledge and to their not being
associated with a liberated acarya.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.2):
evam parampara-praptam
imam rajarsayo viduh
sa kaleneha mahata
yogo nastah parantapa
"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings
understood it in that way. But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it
is appears to be lost." Guided by so-called psychologists and philosophers, people in the modern age do
not know of the activities of the subtle body and thus cannot understand what is meant by the
transmigration of the soul. In these matters we have to take the authorized statements of Bhagavad-gita
(2.13):
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
Unless all human society understands this important verse in Bhagavad-gita, civilization will advance in
ignorance, not in knowledge.
