sri-rudra uvaca
jitam ta atma-vid-varyasvastaye
svastir astu me
bhavataradhasa raddham
sarvasma atmane namah

TRANSLATION
Lord Siva addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead with the following prayer: O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, all glories unto You. You are the most exalted of all self-realized souls. Since You
are always auspicious for the self-realized, I wish that You be auspicious for me. You are worshipable by
virtue of the all-perfect instructions You give. You are the Supersoul; therefore I offer my obeisances unto
You as the supreme living being.
PURPORT
As soon as a devotee is inspired by the Lord to offer the Lord a prayer, the devotee immediately glorifies
the Lord in the beginning by saying, "All glories unto You, my Lord." The Lord is glorified because He is
considered to be the chief of all self-realized souls. As said in the Vedas (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13), nityo
nityanam cetanas cetananam: the Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the chief living being
amongst all living beings. There are different kinds of individual living beings--some of them are in this
material world, and some are in the spiritual world. Those who are in the spiritual world are known to be
completely self-realized because on the spiritual platform the living entity is not forgetful of his service to
the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world all those who are in the devotional service of the Lord are
eternally fixed, for they understand the position of the Supreme Being, as well as their individual
constitution. Thus amongst self-realized souls, the Lord is known as the perfectly self-realized soul. Nityo
nityanam cetanas cetananam. When the individual soul is fixed in his knowledge of the Lord as the
Supreme Being, he actually becomes established in an all-auspicious position. Lord Siva prays herein that
his auspicious position continue eternally by virtue of the Lord's mercy upon him.
The Supreme Lord is all-perfect, and the Lord instructs that one who worships Him also becomes
perfect. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15): mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca. The Lord is situated as
the Supersoul in everyone's heart, but He is so kind to His devotees that He gives them instructions by
which they may continue to progress. When they receive instructions from the all-perfect, there is no
chance of their being misled. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.10): dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te. The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the pure devotee so that the
devotee can advance further and further in devotional service. Since the Lord gives instructions as
sarvatma, the Supersoul, Lord Siva offers Him respect with the words sarvatma atmane namah. The
individual soul is called atma, and the Lord is also called atma as well as Paramatma. Being situated in
everyone's heart, the Lord is known as the supreme atma. Therefore all obeisances are offered unto Him.
In this regard, one may refer to the prayers of Kunti in the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.20):
tatha paramahamsanam
muninam amalatmanam
bhakti-yoga-vidhanartham
katham pasyema hi striyah
The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the paramahamsas, or the topmost devotees of the Lord,
who are completely liberated from all contaminations of the material world. The Lord always gives
instructions to such exalted devotees to inform them how they can remain fixed in devotional service.
Similarly, it is stated in the atmarama verse (Bhag. 1.7.10):
atmaramas ca munayo
nirgrantha apy urukrame
kurvanty ahaitukim bhaktim
ittham-bhuta-guno harih
The word atmarama refers to those who are not interested in the material world but are simply engaged
in spiritual realization. Such self-realized persons are generally considered in two categories--impersonal
and personal. However, impersonalists also become devotees when they are attracted by the personal
transcendental qualities of the Lord. The conclusion is that Lord Siva wanted to remain a fixed devotee of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. As explained in the following verses, Lord Siva never
desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord like the impersonalists. Rather, he thinks that it
would be good fortune for him to continue to be fixed in the understanding of the Lord as the Supreme
Being. By this understanding, one realizes that all living entities--including Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and
other demigods--are servants of the Supreme Lord.
