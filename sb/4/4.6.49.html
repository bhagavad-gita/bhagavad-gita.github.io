<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya continued: My dear sinless Vidura, Lord Visnu is actually the enjoyer of the results of all
sacrifices. Yet because of His being the Supersoul of all living entities, He was satisfied simply with His
share of the sacrificial offerings. He therefore addressed Daksa in a pleasing attitude.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (5.29) it is said, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam: Lord Visnu, or Krsna, is the supreme
enjoyer of all the results of sacrifices, austerities and penances; in whatever one may engage, the ultimate
goal is Visnu. If a person does not know that, he is misled. As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu
has nothing to demand from anyone. He is self-satisfied, self-sufficient, but He accepts the offerings of
yajna because of His friendly attitude toward all living entities. When His share of the sacrificial results
was offered to Him, He appeared very pleased. It is said in Bhagavad-gita (9.26), patram puspam phalam
toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati: if any devotee offers Him even a small leaf, or a flower or water, if it is
offered with love and affection, the Lord accepts it and is pleased. Although He is self-sufficient and does
not need anything from anyone, He accepts such offerings because, as Supersoul, He has such a friendly
attitude toward all living entities. Another point here is that He does not encroach upon another's share.
ln the yajna there is a share for the demigods, Lord Siva, and Lord Brahma, and a share for Lord Visnu. He
is satisfied with His own share and does not encroach upon others'. Indirectly, He indicated that He was
not satisfied with Daksa's trying to deny Lord Siva his share. Maitreya addressed Vidura as sinless because
Vidura was a pure Vaisnava and never committed any offense to any demigod. Although Vaisnavas accept
Lord Visnu as the Supreme, they are not prone to offend demigods. They give the demigods proper
respect. Vaisnavas accept Lord Siva as the best Vaisnava. For a Vaisnava there is no possibility of
offending any demigods, and the demigods are also pleased with the Vaisnava because they are faultless
devotees of Lord Visnu.
