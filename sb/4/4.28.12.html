philosophy; nyasa--by accepting sannyasa; svadhyayayoh--and by study of Vedic literature; api--even;
kim--what is the use; va--or; sreyobhih--by auspicious activities; anyaih--other; ca--and; na--never; yatra--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Transcendental practices that do not ultimately help one realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead
are useless, be they mystic yoga practices, the analytical study of matter, severe austerity, the acceptance
of sannyasa, or the study of Vedic literature. All these may be very important aspects of spiritual
advancement, but unless one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, all these processes
are useless.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 24.109) it is said:
bhakti vina kevala jnane 'mukti' nahi haya
bhakti sadhana kare yei 'prapta-brahma-laya'
Impersonalists do not take to devotional service, but take to other practices, such as the analytical study
of the material elements, the discrimination between matter and spirit, and the mystic yoga system. These
are beneficial only insofar as they are complementary to devotional service. Caitanya Mahaprabhu
therefore told Sanatana Gosvami that without a touch of devotional service, jnana, yoga and Sankhya
philosophy cannot give one the desired results. The impersonalists wish to merge into the Supreme
Brahman; however, merging into the Supreme Brahman also requires a touch of devotional service. The
Absolute Truth is realized in three phases--impersonal Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. All these require a touch of devotional service. Sometimes it is actually seen that these
Mayavadis also chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, although their motive is to merge into the Brahman
effulgence of the Absolute. The yogis also at times take to chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, but their
purpose is different from that of the bhaktas. In all processes--karma, jnana or yoga--bhakti is required.
That is the purport of this verse.
