<h2>Text</h2>
tulayama lavenapi
na svargam napunar-bhavam
bhagavat-sangi-sangasya
martyanam kim utasisah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tulayama--we compare; lavena--with a moment; api--even; na--not; svargam--attainment of the heavenly
planets; na--not; apunah-bhavam--merging into the Brahman effulgence; bhagavat--of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; sangi--with associates; sangasya--of association; martyanam--of persons who are
destined to die; kim uta--how much less; asisah--benedictions.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even a moment's association with a pure devotee cannot be compared to being transferred to heavenly
planets or even merging into the Brahman effulgence in complete liberation. For living entities who are
destined to give up the body and die, association with pure devotees is the highest benediction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great saint Prabodhananda Sarasvati, a devotee of Lord Caitanya, has stated: kaivalyam narakayate
tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate. For a pure devotee, kaivalya, merging into the existence of Brahman, the
Brahman effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets
(tridasa-pur) just another kind of phantasmagoria. In other words, a pure devotee does not place much
value in the destination of the karmis (the heavenly planets) or in the destination of the jnanis (merging
into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers a moment's association with another pure devotee
to be far superior to residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The topmost
benediction for those who are living in this material world and are subjected to the repetition of birth and
death (transmigration) is association with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and
remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though living within the material world.
This Krsna consciousness movement is started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially
may take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with it. In this way the confused
and frustrated inhabitants of this material world may find the highest happiness in association with
devotees.
