yani rupani jagrhe
indro haya-jihirsaya
tani papasya khandani
lingam khandam ihocyate
SYNONYMS
yani--all those which; rupani--forms; jagrhe--accepted; indrah--the King of heaven; haya--the horse;
jihirsaya--with a desire to steal; tani--all those; papasya--of sinful activities; khandani--signs; lingam--the
symbol; khandam--the word khanda; iha--here; ucyate--is said.
TRANSLATION
Whatever different forms Indra assumed as a mendicant because of his desire to seize the horse were
symbols of atheistic philosophy.
PURPORT
According to Vedic civilization, sannyasa is one of the essential items in the program of the varnaasrama
institution. One should accept sannyasa according to the parampara system of the acaryas. At the
present moment, however, many so-called sannyasis or mendicants have no understanding of God
consciousness. Such sannyasa was introduced by Indra because of his jealousy of Maharaja Prthu, and
what he introduced is again appearing in the age of Kali. practically none of the sannyasis in this age are
bona fide. No one can introduce any new system into the Vedic way of life; if one does so out of malice,
he is to be known as a pasandi, or atheist. In the Vaisnava Tantra it is said:
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
Although it is forbidden, there are many pasandis who coin terms like daridra-narayana and svaminarayana,
although not even such demigods as Brahma and Siva can be equal to Narayana.
TEXTS 24-25

tad-grhita-visrstesu
pakhandesu matir nrnam

nagna-rakta-patadisu

SYNONYMS
evam--thus; indre--when the King of heaven; harati--stole; asvam--the horse; vainya--of the son of King
Vena; yajna--the sacrifice; jighamsaya--with a desire to stop; tat--by him; grhita--accepted; visrstesu--
abandoned; pakhandesu--towards the sinful dress; matih--attraction; nrnam--of the people in general;
dharmah--system of religion; iti--thus; upadharmesu--towards false religious systems; nagna--naked;
rakta-pata--red-robed; adisu--etc.; prayena--generally; sajjate--is attracted; bhrantya--foolishly; pesalesu--
expert; ca--and; vagmisu--eloquent.
TRANSLATION
In this way, King Indra, in order to steal the horse from King Prthu's sacrifice, adopted several orders of
sannyasa. Some sannyasis go naked, and sometimes they wear red garments and pass under the name of
kapalika. These are simply symbolic representations of their sinful activities. These so-called sannyasis are
very much appreciated by sinful men because they are all godless atheists and very expert in putting
forward arguments and reasons to support their case. We must know, however, that they are only passing
as adherents of religion and are not so in fact. Unfortunately, bewildered persons accept them as religious,
and being attracted to them, they spoil their life.
PURPORT
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, men in this age of Kali are short-lived, devoid of spiritual knowledge,
and susceptible to accept false religious systems due to their unfortunate condition. Thus they always
remain mentally disturbed. The Vedic sastras practically prohibit the adoption of sannyasa in the age of
Kali because less intelligent men may accept the sannyasa order for cheating purposes. Actually the only
religion is the religion of surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We must serve the Lord in
Krsna consciousness. All other systems of sannyasa and religion are actually not bona fide. In this age they
are simply passing for religious systems. This is most regrettable.
