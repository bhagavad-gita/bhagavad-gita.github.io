<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After taking his dinner and having his thirst and hunger satisfied, King Puranjana felt some joy within
his heart. Instead of being elevated to a higher consciousness, he became captivated by Cupid, and was
moved by a desire to find his wife, who kept him satisfied in his household life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse is very significant for those desiring to elevate themselves to a higher level of Krsna
consciousness. When a person is initiated by a spiritual master, he changes his habits and does not eat
undesirable eatables or engage in the eating of meat, the drinking of liquor, illicit sex or gambling.
Sattvika-ahara, foodstuffs in the mode of goodness, are described in the sastras as wheat, rice, vegetables,
fruits, milk, sugar, and milk products. Simple food like rice, dhal, capatis, vegetables, milk and sugar
constitute a balanced diet, but sometimes it is found that an initiated person, in the name of prasada, eats
very luxurious foodstuffs. Due to his past sinful life he becomes attracted by Cupid and eats good food
voraciously. It is clearly visible that when a neophyte in Krsna consciousness eats too much, he falls
down. Instead of being elevated to pure Krsna consciousness, he becomes attracted by Cupid. The socalled
brahmacari becomes agitated by women, and the vanaprastha may again become captivated into
having sex with his wife. Or he may begin to search out another wife. Due to some sentiment, he may give
up his own wife and come into the association of devotees and a spiritual master, but due to his past
sinful life he cannot stay. Instead of being elevated to Krsna consciousness, he falls down, being attracted
by Cupid, and takes to another wife for sex enjoyment. The fall of the neophyte devotee from the path of
Krsna consciousness down to material life is described in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17) by Narada Muni.
tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer
bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi
yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim
ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah
This indicates that although a neophyte devotee may fall down from the path of Krsna consciousness
due to his immaturity, his service to Krsna never goes in vain. However, a person who remains steadfast
in his family duty or so-called social or family obligation but does not take to Krsna consciousness
receives no profit. One who comes to Krsna consciousness must be very cautious and refrain from
prohibited activities, as defined by Rupa Gosvami in his Upadesamrta:
atyaharah prayasas ca
prajalpo niyamagrahah
jana-sangas ca laulyam ca
sadbhir bhaktir vinasyati
A neophyte devotee should neither eat too much nor collect more money than necessary. Eating too
much or collecting too much is called atyahara. For such atyahara one must endeavor very much. This is
called prayasa. Superficially one may show himself to be very much faithful to the rules and regulations,
but at the same time not be fixed in the regulative principles. This is called niyamagraha. By mixing with
undesirable persons, or jana-sanga, one becomes tainted with lust and greed and falls down from the path
of devotional service.
