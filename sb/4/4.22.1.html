<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: Vijitasva, the eldest son of Maharaja Prthu, who had a reputation
like his father's, became emperor and gave his younger brothers different directions of the world to
govern, for he was very affectionate toward his brothers.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After describing the life and character of Maharaja Prthu in the previous chapter, the great sage Maitreya
began to speak about the sons and grandsons in the genealogical line of the Prthu dynasty. After the death
of Maharaja Prthu, his eldest son, Vijitasva, became emperor of the world. King Vijitasva was very
affectionate toward his younger brothers, and therefore he wanted them to rule different directions of the
world. From time immemorial the eldest son generally becomes king after the death of the previous king.
When the Pandavas ruled the earth, Maharaja Yudhisthira, the eldest son of King Pandu, became emperor,
and his younger brothers assisted him. Similarly, King Vijitasva's younger brothers were appointed to
govern the different directions of the world.
