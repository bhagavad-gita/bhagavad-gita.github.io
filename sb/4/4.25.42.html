<h2>Text</h2>
pare brahmani catmanam
param brahma tathatmani
viksamano vihayeksam
asmad upararama ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pare--transcendental; brahmani--in the Absolute; ca--and; atmanam--the self; param--the supreme;
brahma--Absolute; tatha--also; atmani--in himself; viksamanah--thus observing; vihaya--giving up;
iksam--reservation; asmat--from this process; upararama--retired; ha--certainly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Malayadhvaja could thus observe that the Supersoul was sitting by his side, and that he, as the
individual soul, was sitting by the side of the Supersoul. Since both were together, there was no need for
separate interests; thus he ceased from such activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the advanced stage of devotional service, the devotee does not see anything separate between his own
interests and those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Both interests become one, for the devotee
does not act for a separate interest. Whatever he does, he does in the interest of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. At that time he sees everything in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supreme
personality of Godhead in everything. Having attained this stage of understanding, he sees no distinction
between the spiritual and material worlds. In perfect vision, the material world becomes the spiritual
world due to its being the external energy of the Supreme Lord. For the perfect devotee, the energy and
the energetic are nondifferent. Thus the so-called material world becomes spiritual (sarvam khalv idam
brahma). Everything is intended for the service of the Supreme Lord, and the expert devotee can utilize
any so-called material thing for the Lord's service. One cannot serve the Lord without being situated on
the spiritual platform. Thus if a so-called material thing is dovetailed in the service of the Lord, it is no
longer to be considered material. Thus the pure devotee, in his perfect vision, sees from all angles.
