<h2>Text</h2>
kirtyordhva-gitaya pumbhis
trailokye tatra tatra ha
pravistah karna-randhresu
strinam ramah satam iva
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kirtya--by reputation; urdhva-gitaya--by loud declaration; pumbhih--by the general public; trai-lokye--
all over the universe; tatra tatra--here and there; ha--certainly; pravistah--entering; karna-randhresu--in
the aural holes; strinam--of the women; ramah--Lord Ramacandra; satam--of the devotees; iva--like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Throughout the whole universe--in the higher, lower and middle planetary systems--Prthu Maharaja's
reputation was loudly declared, and all ladies and saintly persons heard his glories, which were as sweet
as the glories of Lord Ramacandra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words strinam and ramah are significant. It is the practice amongst ladies to hear and
enjoy the praises of certain heroes. From this verse it appears that Prthu Maharaja's reputation was so
great that ladies all over the universe would hear of it with great pleasure. At the same time, his glories
were heard all over the universe by the devotees, and they were as pleasing as Lord Ramacandra's glories.
Lord Ramacandra's kingdom is still existing, and recently there was a political party in India named the
Ramarajya party, which wanted to establish a kingdom resembling the kingdom of Rama. Unfortunately,
modern politicians want the kingdom of Rama without Rama Himself. Although they have banished the
idea of God consciousness, they still expect to establish the kingdom of Rama. Such a proposal is rejected
by devotees. Prthu Maharaja's reputation was heard by saintly persons because he exactly represented
Lord Ramacandra, the ideal king.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Prthu Maharaja's Meeting With the Four Kumaras."
Chapter Twenty-three

Maharaja Prthu' s Going Back Home
