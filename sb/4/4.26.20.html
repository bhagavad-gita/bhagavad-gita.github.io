<h2>Text</h2>
anuninye 'tha sanakair
viro 'nunaya-kovidah
pasparsa pada-yugalam
aha cotsanga-lalitam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anuninye--began to flatter; atha--thus; sanakaih--gradually; virah--the hero; anunaya-kovidah--one who
is very expert in flattery; pasparsa--touched; pada-yugalam--both the feet; aha--he said; ca--also; utsanga--
on his lap; lalitam--thus being embraced.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because the King was very expert in flattery, he began to pacify his Queen very slowly. First he touched
her two feet, then embraced her nicely, seating her on his lap, and began to speak as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One has to awaken his Krsna consciousness by first regretting his past deeds. Just as King Puranjana
began to flatter his Queen, one should, by deliberate consideration, raise himself to the platform of Krsna
consciousness. To attain such an end, one must touch the lotus feet of the spiritual master. Krsna
consciousness cannot be achieved by self-endeavor. One must therefore approach a self-realized, Krsna
conscious person and touch his lotus feet. Prahlada Maharaja therefore said:
naisam matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo-'bhisekam
niskincananam na vrnita yavat
(Bhag. 7.5.32)
One cannot come to the precincts of Krsna consciousness unless he touches the dust of the lotus feet of
a person who has become a mahatma, a great devotee. This is the beginning of the surrendering process.
Lord Krsna wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and this surrendering process begins when one
touches the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. By sincerely rendering service to a bona fide spiritual
master, one begins his spiritual life in Krsna consciousness. Touching the lotus feet of a spiritual master
means giving up one's false prestige and unnecessarily puffed-up position in the material world. Those
who remain in the darkness of material existence due to their falsely prestigious positions--so-called
scientists and philosophers--are actually atheists. They do not know the ultimate cause of everything.
Although bewildered, they are not ready to surrender themselves to the lotus feet of a person who knows
things in their proper perspective. In other words, one cannot arouse Krsna consciousness simply by his
own mental speculation. One must surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. Only this process will help
one.
