<h2>Text</h2>
aprthag-dharma-silanam
sarvesam vah sumadhyama
aprthag-dharma-sileyam
bhuyat patny arpitasaya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aprthak--without differences; dharma--occupation; silanam--whose character; sarvesam--all; vah--of
you; su-madhyama--a girl whose waist is slender; aprthak--without differences; dharma--occupation; sila--
well-behaved; iyam--this; bhuyat--may she become; patni--wife; arpita-asaya--fully surrendered.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
You brothers are all of the same nature, being devotees and obedient sons of your father. Similarly, that
girl is also of the same type and is dedicated to all of you. Thus both the girl and you, the sons of
Pracinabarhisat, are on the same platform, being united on a common principle.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic principles, a woman cannot have many husbands, although a husband can have
many wives. In special instances, however, it is found that a woman has more than one husband.
Draupadi, for instance, was married to all of the five Pandava brothers. Similarly, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead ordered all the sons of Pracinabarhisat to marry the one girl born of the great sage Kandu and
Pramloca. In special cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able to treat her
husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman. Only one who is especially qualified can be
allowed to marry more than one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very
difficult. Thus according to scripture, kalau panca vivarjayet. In this age a woman is forbidden to marry
her husband's brother. This system is still practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says:
aprthag-dharma-sileyam bhuyat patny arpitasaya. With the blessings of the Lord, all things are possible.
The Lord especially blessed the girl to surrender equally to all brothers. Aprthag-dharma, meaning
"occupational duty without difference of purpose," is taught in Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita is divided
into three primary divisions--karma-yoga, jnana-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The word yoga means "acting on
behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." As confirmed by Bhagavad-gita (3.9):
yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra
loko 'yam karma-bandhanah
tad-artham karma kaunteya
mukta-sangah samacara
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material
world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you
will always remain unattached and free from bondage."
One may act according to his own occupational duty just to satisfy the yajna-purusa, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is called aprthag-dharma. Different limbs of the body may act in different
ways, but the ultimate objective is to maintain the entire body. Similarly, if we work for the satisfaction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that we satisfy everything. We should follow in the
footsteps of the Pracetas, whose only aim was to satisfy the Supreme Lord. This is called aprthag-dharma.
According to Bhagavad-gita (18.66), sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Abandon all
varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This is the advice of Lord Krsna. Our only aim should be
to act in Krsna consciousness for the satisfaction of the Lord. This is oneness, or aprthag-dharma.
