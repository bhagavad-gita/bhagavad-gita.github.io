<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus, in order to give up her body, which had been so respectfully and affectionately seated on the lap
of Lord Siva, who is worshiped by great sages and saints, Sati, due to anger towards her father, began to
meditate on the fiery air within the body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva is described herein as the best of all great souls. Although Sati's body was born of Daksa, Lord
Siva used to adore her by sitting her on his lap. This is considered a great token of respect. Thus Sati's
body was not ordinary, but still she decided to give it up because it was the source of unhappiness
because of its connection with Daksa. This severe example set by Sati is to be followed. One should be
extremely careful about associating with persons who are not respectful to the higher authorities. lt is
instructed, therefore, in the Vedic literature that one should always be free from the association of atheists
and nondevotees and should try to associate with devotees, for by the association of a devotee one can be
elevated to the platform of self-realization. This injunction is stressed in many places in Srimad-
Bhagavatam; if one wants to be liberated from the clutches of material existence, then one has to associate
with great souls, and if one wants to continue one's material existential life, then one may associate with
persons who are materialistic. The materialistic way of life is based on sex life. Thus both becoming
addicted to sex life and associating with persons who are addicted to sex life are condemned in the Vedic
literature because such association will simply interfere with one's spiritual progress. However,
association with great personalities, devotees who are great souls, will elevate one to the spiritual
platform. Satidevi decided to quit the body she had obtained from Daksa's body, and she wanted to
transfer herself to another body so that she might have completely uncontaminated association with Lord
Siva. Of course, it is understood that in her next life she would take birth as the daughter of the
Himalayas, Parvati, and then she would again accept Lord Siva as her husband. Sati and Lord Siva are
eternally related; even after she changes her body, their relationship is never broken.
