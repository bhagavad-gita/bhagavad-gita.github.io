<h2>Text</h2>
gotram tvadiyam bhagavan vrsadhvajo
daksayanity aha yada sudurmanah
vyapeta-narma-smitam asu tadaham
vyutsraksya etat kunapam tvad-angajam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
gotram--family relationship; tvadiyam--your; bhagavan--the possessor of all opulences; vrsadhvajah--
Lord Siva; daksayani--Daksayani (the daughter of Daksa); iti--thus; aha--calls; yada--when; sudurmanah--
very morose; vyapeta--disappear; narma-smitam--my jolliness and smile; asu--immediately; tada--then;
aham--I; vyutsraksye--I shall give up; etat--this (body); kunapam--dead body; tvat-anga-jam--produced
from your body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of our family relationship, when Lord Siva addresses me as Daksayani I at once become morose,
and my jolliness and my smile at once disappear. I feel very much sorry that my body, which is just like a
bag, has been produced by you. I shall therefore give it up.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word daksayani means "the daughter of King Daksa." Sometimes, when there was relaxed
conversation between husband and wife, Lord Siva used to call Sati "the daughter of King Daksa," and
because this very word reminded her about her family relationship with King Daksa, she at once became
ashamed because Daksa was an incarnation of all offenses. Daksa was the embodiment of envy, for he
unnecessarily blasphemed a great personality, Lord Siva. Simply upon hearing the word daksayani, she
felt afflicted because of reference to the context because her body was the symbol of all the offensiveness
with which Daksa was endowed. Since her body was constantly a source of unhappiness, she decided to
give it up.
