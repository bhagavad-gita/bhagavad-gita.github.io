TRANSLATION
First of all she sat in the required sitting posture, and then she carried the life air upwards and placed it
in the position of equilibrium near the navel. Then she raised her life air, mixed with intelligence, to the
heart and then gradually towards the pulmonary passage and from there to between her eyebrows.
PURPORT
The yogic process is to control the air passing within the body in different places called sat-cakra, the
six circles of air circulation. The air is raised from the abdomen to the navel, from the navel to the heart,
from the heart to the throat, from the throat to between the eyebrows and from between the eyebrows to
the top of the cerebrum. That is the sum and substance of practicing yoga. Before practicing the real yoga
system, one has to practice the sitting postures because this helps in the breathing exercises which control
the airs going upwards and downwards. This is a great technique which one has to practice to attain the
highest perfectional stage of yoga, but such practice is not meant for this age. No one in this age can attain
the perfectional stage of such yoga, but people indulge in practicing sitting postures, which is more or less
a gymnastic process. By such bodily gymnastics one may develop good circulation and may therefore keep
one's body fit, but if one simply restricts oneself to that gymnastic process one cannot attain the highest
perfectional stage. The yoga process, as described in the Kesava-sruti, prescribes how one can control his
living force according to his desire and transmigrate from one body to another or from one place to
another. In other words, yoga practice is not meant to keep the body fit. Any transcendental process of
spiritual realization automatically helps one to keep the body fit, for it is the spirit soul that keeps the
body always fresh. As soon as the spirit soul is out of the body, the material body immediately begins to
decompose. Any spiritual process keeps the body fit without separate endeavor, but if one takes it that the
ultimate aim of yoga is to maintain the body, then he is mistaken. The real perfection of yoga is elevation
of the soul to a higher position or the liberation of the soul from material entanglement. Some yogis try to
elevate the soul to higher planetary systems, where the standard of life is different from that of this planet
and where the material comforts, life-span and other facilities for self-realization are greater, and some
yogis endeavor to elevate the soul to the spiritual world, the spiritual Vaikuntha planets. The bhakti-yoga
process directly elevates the soul to the spiritual planets, where life is eternally blissful and full of
knowledge; therefore bhakti-yoga is considered to be the greatest of all yoga systems.
