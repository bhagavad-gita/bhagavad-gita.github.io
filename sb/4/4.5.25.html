<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear .ksatta, Vidura, the celestial damsels come down to those rivers in their airplanes with their
husbands, and after sexual enjoyment, they enter the water and enjoy sprinkling their husbands with
water.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood that even the damsels of the heavenly planets are polluted by thoughts of sex
enjoyment, and therefore they come in airplanes to bathe in the rivers Nanda and Alakananda. It is
significant that these rivers, Nanda and Alakananda, are sanctified by the dust of the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, just as the Ganges is sacred because its water emanates
from the toes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, so whenever water or anything is in
touch with devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is purified and spiritualized. The
rules and regulations of devotional service are based on this principle: anything in touch with the lotus
feet of the Lord is immediately freed from all material contamination.
The damsels of the heavenly planets, polluted by thoughts of sex life, come down to bathe in the
sanctified rivers and enjoy sprinkling water on their husbands. Two words are very significant in this
connection. Rati-karsitah means that the damsels become morose after sex enjoyment. Although they
accept sex enjoyment as a bodily demand, afterwards they are not happy.
Another significant point is that Lord Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is described here
as Tirthapada. Tirtha means "sanctified place," and pada means "the lotus feet of the Lord." People go to a
sanctified place to free themselves from all sinful reactions. In other words, those who are devoted to the
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, automatically become sanctified. The Lord's
lotus feet are called tirtha-pada because under their protection there are hundreds and thousands of
saintly persons who sanctify the sacred places of pilgrimage. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura, a great acarya
of the Gaudiya Vaisnava-sampradaya, advises us not to travel to different places of pilgrimage.
Undoubtedly it is troublesome to go from one place to another, but one who is intelligent can take shelter
of the lotus feet of Govinda and thereby be automatically sanctified as the result of his pilgrimage. Anyone
who is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Govinda is called tirtha-pada; he does not need to travel on
various pilgrimages, for he can enjoy all the benefits of such travel simply by engaging in the service of
the lotus feet of the Lord. Such a pure devotee, who has implicit faith in the lotus feet of the Lord, can
create sacred places in any part of the world where he decides to remain. Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani (Bhag.
1.13.10). The places are sanctified due to the presence of pure devotees; any place automatically becomes
a place of pilgrimage if either the Lord or His pure devotee remains or resides there. In other words, such
a pure devotee, who is engaged one hundred percent in the service of the Lord, can remain anywhere in
the universe, and that part of the universe immediately becomes a sacred place where he can peacefully
render service to the Lord as the Lord desires.
