<h2>Translation</h2>
There were emerald staircases which led to lakes full of variously colored lotus flowers and lilies, and
swans, karandavas, cakravakas, cranes and similar other valuable birds were visible in those lakes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that not only was the palace surrounded by compounds and gardens with varieties of trees,
but there were small man-made lakes also, where the water was full of many-colored lotus flowers and
lilies, and to get down to the lakes there were staircases made of valuable jewels such as emeralds. By the
beautifully positioned garden houses there were many luxuriant birds, such as swans, cakravakas,
karandavas and cranes. These birds generally do not live in filthy places like crows do. The atmosphere of
the city was very healthy and beautiful; it can simply be imagined from its description.
