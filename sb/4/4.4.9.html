<h2>Translation</h2>
Present in the arena of sacrifice, Sati saw that there were no oblations for her husband, Lord Siva. Next
she realized that not only had her father failed to invite Lord Siva, but when he saw Lord Siva's exalted
wife, Daksa did not receive her either. Thus she became greatly angry, so much so that she looked at her
father as if she were going to burn him with her eyes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By offering oblations in the fire while chanting the Vedic mantra svaha, one offers respect to all the
demigods, great sages and Pitas, including Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. It is customary that
Siva is one of those who are offered respects, but Sati, while personally present in the arena, saw that the
brahmanas did not utter the mantra offering oblations to Lord Siva, namah sivaya svaha. She was not
sorry for herself, for she was ready to come to her father's house without being invited, but she wanted to
see whether or not her husband was being respected. To see her relatives, her sisters and mother, was not
so important; even when she was received by her mother and sisters she did not care, for she was most
concerned that her husband was being insulted in the sacrifice. When she marked the insult, she became
greatly angry, and she looked at her father so angrily that Daksa appeared to burn in her vision.
