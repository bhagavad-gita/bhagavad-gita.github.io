<h2>Translation</h2>
After this, the Queen executed the necessary funerary functions and offered oblations of water. After
bathing in the river, she offered obeisances to various demigods situated in the sky in the different
planetary systems. She then circumambulated the fire and, while thinking of the lotus feet of her husband,
entered its flames.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The entrance of a chaste wife into the flames of the pyre of her dead husband is known as saha-gamana,
which means "dying with the husband." This system of saha-gamana had been practiced in Vedic
civilization from time immemorial. Even after the British period in India this practice was rigidly
observed, but soon it degraded to the point that even when the wife was not strong enough to enter the
fire of her dead husband, the relatives would force her to enter. Thus this practice had to be stopped, but
even today there are still some solitary cases where a wife we personally knew of a chaste wife who died in
this way.
