<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord continued: My dear Daksa Dvija, I am the original Personality of Godhead, but in order to
create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation, I act through My material energy, and
according to the different grades of activity, My representations are differently named.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.5), jiva-bhutam maha-baho: the whole world is energy released from
the supreme source, the Personality of Godhead, who, it is further stated in Bhagavad-gita, acts in
superior energies and inferior energies. The superior energy is the living entity, who is part and parcel of
the Supreme Lord. As parts and parcels, the living entities are not different from the Supreme Lord; the
energy emanated from Him is not different from Him. But in the actual activity of this material world, the
living entity is under the different qualities of material energy and in different forms. There are 8,400,000
life forms. The same living entity acts under the influence of the different qualities of material nature. The
entities have different bodies, but originally, in the beginning of creation, Lord Visnu is alone. For the
purpose of creation, Brahma is manifested, and for annihilation there is Lord Siva. As far as the spiritual
entrance into the material world is concerned, all beings are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but
under the covering of different material qualities they have different names. Lord Brahma and Lord Siva
are qualitative incarnations of Visnu, as guna-avataras, and Visnu with them accepts control of the quality
of goodness; therefore He is also a qualitative incarnation like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. Actually the
different names exist for different directions, otherwise the origin is one only.
