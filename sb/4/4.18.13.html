<a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/13"><b>13</b></a>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
tathapare ca sarvatra
saram adadate budhah
tato 'nye ca yatha-kamam
duduhuh prthu-bhavitam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatha--so; apare--others; ca--also; sarvatra--everywhere; saram--the essence; adadate--took; budhah--the
intelligent class of men; tatah--thereafter; anye--others; ca--also; yatha-kamam--as much as they desired;
duduhuh--milked; prthu-bhavitam--the planet earth, controlled by Prthu Maharaja.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Others, who were as intelligent as King Prthu, also took the essence out of the earthly planet. Indeed,
everyone took this opportunity to follow in the footsteps of King Prthu and get whatever he desired from
the planet earth.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The planet earth is also called vasundhara. The word vasu means "wealth," and dhara means "one who
holds." All creatures within the earth fulfill the necessities required for human beings, and all living
entities can be taken out of the earth by the proper means. As suggested by the planet earth, and accepted
and initiated by King Prthu, whatever is taken from the earth--either from the mines, from the surface of
the globe or from the atmosphere--should always be considered the property of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and should be used for Yajna, Lord Visnu. As soon as the process of yajna is stopped, the
earth will withhold all productions--vegetables, trees, plants, fruits, flowers, other agricultural products
and minerals. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, the process of yajna was instituted from the beginning of
creation. By the regular performance of yajna, the equal distribution of wealth and the restriction of sense
gratification, the entire world will be made peaceful and prosperous. As already mentioned, in this age of
Kali the simple performance of sankirtana-yajna--the holding of festivals as initiated by the International
Society for Krishna Consciousness--should be introduced in every town and village. Intelligent men
should encourage the performance of sankirtana-yajna by their personal behavior. This means that they
should follow the process of austerity by restricting themselves from illicit sex life, meat-eating, gambling
and intoxication. If the intelligent men, or the brahmanas of society, would follow the rules and
regulations, certainly the entire face of this present world, which is in such chaotic condition, would
change, and people would be happy and prosperous.
