<h2>Translation</h2>
Engage yourself fully, therefore, in the devotional service of the Lord, for only He can deliver us from
this entanglement of materialistic existence. Although the Lord is attached to His material potency, He is
aloof from her activities. Everything in this material world is happening by the inconceivable potency of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In continuation of the previous verse, it is specifically mentioned here that Dhruva Maharaja should
engage himself in devotional service. Devotional service cannot be rendered to the impersonal Brahman
feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whenever the word bhajasva appears, meaning "engage
yourself in devotional service," there must be the servant, service and the served. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is served, the mode of activities to please Him is called service, and one who
renders such service is called the servant. Another significant feature in this verse is that only the Lord,
and no one else, is to be served. That is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (mam ekam saranam vraja). There
is no need to serve the demigods, who are just like the hands and legs of the Supreme Lord. When the
Supreme Lord is served, the hands and legs of the Supreme Lord are automatically served. There is no
need of separate service. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (12.7), tesam aham samuddharta mrtyu-samsarasagarat.
This means that the Lord, in order to show specific favor to the devotee, directs the devotee from
within in such a way that ultimately he is delivered from the entanglement of material existence. No one
but the Supreme Lord can help the living entity be delivered from the entanglement of this material
world. The material energy is a manifestation of one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's varieties of
potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). This material energy is one of the Lord's potencies, as much
as heat and light are potencies of fire. The material energy is not different from the Supreme Godhead, but
at the same time He has nothing to do with the material energy. The living entity, who is of the marginal
energy, is entrapped by the material energy on the basis of his desire to lord it over the material world.
The Lord is aloof from this, but when the same living entity engages himself in the devotional service of
the Lord, then he becomes attached to this service. This situation is called yuktam. For devotees the Lord
is present even in the material energy. This is the inconceivable potency of the Lord. Material energy acts
in the three modes of material qualities, which produce the action and reaction of material existence.
Those who are not devotees become involved in such activities, whereas devotees, who are dovetailed
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are freed from such action and reaction of the material energy.
The Lord is therefore described herewith as bhava-cchidam, one who can give deliverance from the
entanglement of material existence.
