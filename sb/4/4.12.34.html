<h2>Text</h2>
tams tan kaman harir dadyad
yan yan kamayate janah
aradhito yathaivaisa
tatha pumsam phalodayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan tan--those; kaman--desired objects; harih--the Lord; dadyat--will award; yan yan--whatsoever;
kamayate--desires; janah--the person; aradhitah--being worshiped; yatha--as; eva--certainly; esah--the
Lord; tatha--similarly; pumsam--of men; phala-udayah--the result.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The performer of the sacrifices [under karma-kanda activities] achieves the fulfillment of the desire for
which he worships the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He awards benedictions to the worshiper according to his desire.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead gives all living entities conditioned within this material world full
freedom to act in their own way. But to His devotee He says that instead of working in that way, it is
better to surrender unto Him, for He will take charge of the devotee. That is the difference between a
devotee and a fruitive actor. The fruitive actor enjoys only the fruits of his own activities, but a devotee,
being under the guidance of the Supreme Lord, simply advances in devotional service to achieve the
ultimate goal of life--to go back home, back to Godhead. The significant word in this verse is kaman,
which means "sense gratificatory desires." A devotee is devoid of all kaman. He is anyabhilasita-sunya: a
devotee is always devoid of all desires for sense gratification. His only aim is to satisfy or gratify the senses
of the Lord. That is the difference between a karmi and a devotee.
