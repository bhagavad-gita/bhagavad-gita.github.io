<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, I therefore do not wish to have the benediction of merging into Your existence, a
benediction in which there is no existence of the nectarean beverage of Your lotus feet. I want the
benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet
from the mouths of Your pure devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verse Maharaja Prthu addressed the Lord as kaivalya-pati, the master of the liberation of
merging into His existence. This does not mean that he was anxious for kaivalya liberation. That is made
clear in this verse: "My dear Lord, I do not want such a benediction." Maharaja Prthu wanted to have a
million ears to hear the glories of the lotus feet of the Lord. He specifically mentioned that the glories of
the Lord should emanate from the mouths of pure devotees, who speak from the cores of their hearts. It is
stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.3), suka-mukhad amrta-drava-samyutam: the nectar of
Srimad-Bhagavatam became more relishable because it emanated from the mouth of Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami. One might think that these glories of the Lord can be heard from anywhere, from the mouths of
either devotees or nondevotees, but here it is specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord must
emanate from the mouths of pure devotees. Sri Sanatana Gosvami has strictly prohibited hearing from the
mouth of a nondevotee. There are many professional reciters of Srimad-Bhagavatam who speak the
narrations very ornamentally, but a pure devotee does not like to hear from them because such
glorification of the Lord is simply a vibration of material sound. But when heard from the mouth of a pure
devotee, glorification of the Lord is immediately effective.
The words satam prasangan mama virya-samvidah (Bhag. 3.25.25) mean that glorification of the Lord is
potent when uttered from the mouth of a pure devotee. The Lord has innumerable devotees all over the
universe, and they have been glorifying the Lord since time immemorial and for an unlimited time. But
still they cannot completely finish enumerating the glories of the Lord. Prthu Maharaja therefore wanted
innumerable ears, as Rupa Gosvami also desired to have millions of ears and millions of tongues to chant
and hear the glorification of the Lord. In other words, if our ears are always engaged in hearing the
glorification of the Lord, there will be no scope for hearing the Mayavada philosophy, which is doom to
spiritual progress. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said that if anyone hears from a Mayavadi philosopher
preaching about the activities of the Lord, even if it is a description from the Vedic literature, he is
ultimately doomed. By hearing such Mayavada philosophy one cannot come to the destination of spiritual
perfection of life.
