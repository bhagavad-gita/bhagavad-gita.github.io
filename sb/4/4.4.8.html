<h2>Text</h2>
saudarya-samprasna-samartha-vartaya
matra ca matr-svasrbhis ca sadaram
dattam saparyam varam asanam ca sa
nadatta pitrapratinandita sati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
saudarya--of her sisters; samprasna--with the greetings; samartha--proper; vartaya--tidings; matra--by
her mother; ca--and; matr-svasrbhih--by her aunts; ca--and; sa-adaram--along with respect; dattam--which
was offered; saparyam--worship, adoration; varam--presents; asanam--a seat; ca--and; sa--she (Sati); na
adatta--did not accept; pitra--by her father; apratinandita--not being welcomed; sati--Sati.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although she was received by her sisters and mother, she did not reply to their words of reception, and
although she was offered a seat and presents, she did not accept anything, for her father neither talked
with her nor welcomed her by asking about her welfare.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sati did not accept the greetings offered by her sisters and mother, for she was not at all satisfied by her
father's silence. Sati was the youngest child of Daksa, and she knew that she was his pet. But now, because
of her association with Lord Siva, Daksa forgot all his affection for his daughter, and this very much
aggrieved her. The material bodily conception is so polluted that even upon slight provocation all our
relationships of love and affection are nullified. Bodily relationships are so transient that even though one
is affectionate towards someone in a bodily relationship, a slight provocation terminates this intimacy.
