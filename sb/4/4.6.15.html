<h2>Translation</h2>
I did not know your full glories. For this reason, I threw arrows of sharp words at you in the open
assembly, although you did not take them into account. I was going down to hell because of my
disobedience to you, who are the most respectable personality, but you took compassion upon me and
saved me by awarding punishment. I request that you be pleased by your own mercy, since I cannot
satisfy you by my words.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As usual, a devotee in an adverse condition of life accepts such a condition to be the mercy of the Lord.
Factually, the insulting words used by Daksa against Lord Siva were enough to have him thrown
perpetually into a hellish life. But Lord Siva, being kind toward him, awarded him punishment to
neutralize the offense. King Daksa realized this and, feeling obliged for Lord Siva's magnanimous
behavior, wanted to show his gratitude. Sometimes a father punishes his child, and when the child is
grown up and comes to his senses, he understands that the father's punishment was not actually
punishment but mercy. Similarly, Daksa appreciated that the punishment offered to him by Lord Siva was
a manifestation of Lord Siva's mercy. That is the symptom of a person making progress on the path of
Krsna consciousness. It is said that a devotee in Krsna consciousness never takes any miserable condition
of life to be condemnation by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He accepts the miserable condition to
be the grace of the Lord. He thinks, "I would have been punished or put into a more dangerous condition
of life due to my past misdeeds, but the Lord has protected me. Thus I have received only a little
punishment as token execution of the law of karma." Thinking of His grace in that way, a devotee always
surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead more and more seriously and is not disturbed by such
so-called punishment.
