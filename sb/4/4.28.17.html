<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Kings, sometimes in the sky there are clouds, sometimes there is darkness, and sometimes
there is illumination. The appearance of all these takes place consecutively. Similarly, in the Supreme
Absolute, the modes of passion, darkness and goodness appear as consecutive energies. Sometimes they
appear, and sometimes they disappear.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Darkness, illumination and clouds sometimes appear and sometimes disappear, but even when they
have disappeared, the potency is still there, always existing. In the sky sometimes we see clouds,
sometimes rainfall and sometimes snow. Sometimes we see night, sometimes day, sometimes illumination
and sometimes darkness. All these exist due to the sun, but the sun is unaffected by all these changes.
Similarly, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of the total cosmic
manifestation, He is unaffected by the material existence. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.4):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My
separated material energies."
Although the material, or physical, elements are the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they
are separate. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is therefore not affected by material conditions. The
Vedanta-sutra confirms, janmady asya yatah: the creation, maintenance and dissolution of this cosmic
manifestation are due to the existence of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, the Lord is unaffected by all
these changes in the material elements. This is indicated by the word pravaha ("emanation"). The sun
always shines brilliantly and is not affected by clouds or darkness. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is always present in His spiritual energy and is not affected by the material emanations. Brahmasamhita
(5.1) confirms:
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes." Although He is the
supreme cause, the cause of all causes, He is still parama, transcendental, and His form is sac-cid-ananda,
eternal, spiritual bliss. Krsna is the shelter of everything, and this is the verdict of all scripture. Krsna is
the remote cause, and material nature is the immediate cause of the cosmic manifestation. In the
Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that understanding prakrti, or nature, to be the cause of everything is like
understanding the nipples on the neck of a goat to be the cause of milk. Material nature is the immediate
cause of the cosmic manifestation, but the original cause is Narayana, Krsna. Sometimes people think that
the cause of an earthen pot is the earth. We see on a potter's wheel a sufficient amount of earth to produce
many pots, and although unintelligent men will say that the earth on the wheel is the cause of the pot,
those who are actually advanced will find that the original cause is the potter, who supplies the earth and
moves the wheel. Material nature may be a helping factor in the creation of this cosmic manifestation, but
it is not the ultimate cause. In Bhagavad-gita (9.10) the Lord therefore says:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and producing all moving and
unmoving beings."
The Supreme Lord casts His glance over material energy, and His glance agitates the three modes of
nature. Creation then takes place. The conclusion is that nature is not the cause of the material
manifestation. The Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes.
