<h2>Translation</h2>
It was fixed that Vaidarbhi, daughter of King Vidarbha, was to be married to a very powerful man,
Malayadhvaja, an inhabitant of the Pandu country. After conquering other princes, he married the
daughter of King Vidarbha.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is customary among ksatriyas for a princess to be offered under certain conditions. For instance,
Draupadi was offered in marriage to one who could pierce a fish with an arrow simply by seeing the
reflection of that fish. Krsna married one of His queens after conquering seven strong bulls. The Vedic
system is for a daughter of a king to be offered under certain conditions. Vaidarbhi, the daughter of
Vidarbha, was offered to a great devotee and powerful king. Since King Malayadhvaja was both a powerful
king and great devotee, he fulfilled all the requirements. The name Malayadhvaja signifies a great devotee
who stands as firm as Malaya Hill and, through his propaganda, makes other devotees similarly as firm.
Such a maha-bhagavata can prevail over the opinions of all others. A strong devotee makes propaganda
against all other spiritual conceptions--namely jnana, karma and yoga. With his devotional flag unfurled,
he always stands fast to conquer other conceptions of transcendental realization. Whenever there is an
argument between a devotee and a nondevotee, the pure, strong devotee comes out victorious.
The word pandya comes from the word panda, meaning "knowledge." Unless one is highly learned, he
cannot conquer nondevotional conceptions. The word para means "transcendental," and pura means
"city." The para-pura is Vaikuntha, the kingdom of God, and the word jaya refers to one who can
conquer. This means that a pure devotee, who is strong in devotional service and who has conquered all
nondevotional conceptions, can also conquer the kingdom of God. In other words, one can conquer the
kingdom of God, Vaikuntha, only by rendering devotional service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead
is called ajita, meaning that no one can conquer Him, but a devotee, by strong devotional service and
sincere attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can easily conquer Him. Lord Krsna is fear
personified for everyone, but He voluntarily agreed to fear the stick of mother Yasoda. Krsna, God, cannot
be conquered by anyone but His devotee. Such a devotee kindly married the daughter of King Vidarbha.
