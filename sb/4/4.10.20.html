<h2>Text</h2>
na vai sva-pakso 'sya vipaksa eva va
parasya mrtyor visatah samam prajah
tam dhavamanam anudhavanty anisa
yatha rajamsy anilam bhuta-sanghah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; vai--however; sva-paksah--ally; asya--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vipaksah--enemy;
eva--certainly; va--or; parasya--of the Supreme; mrtyoh--in the form of time; visatah--entering; samam--
equally; prajah--living entities; tam--Him; dhavamanam--moving; anudhavanti--follow behind; anisah--
dependent living entities; yatha--as; rajamsi--particles of dust; anilam--the wind; bhuta-sanghah--other
material elements.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His feature of eternal time, is present in the material world and
is neutral towards everyone. No one is His ally, and no one is His enemy. Within the jurisdiction of the
time element, everyone enjoys or suffers the result of his own karma, or fruitive activities. As, when the
wind blows, small particles of dust fly in the air, so, according to one's particular karma, one suffers or
enjoys material life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original cause of all causes, He is not responsible
for anyone's material sufferings or enjoyment. There is no such partiality on the part of the Supreme Lord.
The less intelligent accuse the Supreme Lord of being partial and claim that this is why one enjoys in this
material world and another suffers. But this verse specifically says that there is no such partiality on the
part of the Supreme Lord. Living entities, however, are never independent. As soon as they declare their
independence of the supreme controller, they are immediately put into this material world to try their
luck freely, as far as possible. When the material world is created for such misguided living entities, they
create their own karma, fruitive activities, and take advantage of the time element, and thereby they create
their own fortune or misfortune. Everyone is created, everyone is maintained, and everyone is ultimately
killed. As far as these three things are concerned, the Lord is equal to everyone; it is according to one's
karma that one suffers and enjoys. The living entity's higher or lower position, his suffering and enjoying,
are due to his own karma. The exact word used in this connection is anisah, which means "dependent on
their own karma." The example is given that the government gives everyone the facilities for
governmental action and management, but by one's own choice one creates a situation which obliges him
to exist under different types of consciousness. The example given in this verse is that when the wind
blows, particles of dust float in the air. Gradually lightning occurs, and then torrents of rain follow, and
thus the rainy season creates a situation of varieties in the forest. God is very kind--He gives everyone an
equal chance--but by the resultant actions of one's own karma one suffers or enjoys this material world.
