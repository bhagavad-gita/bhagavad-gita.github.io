TRANSLATION
The demigods said: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto the transcendental Personality of
Godhead, who created as His external energy this cosmic manifestation, which is situated in Him as the
air and clouds are situated in space, and who has now appeared in the form of Nara-Narayana Rsi in the
house of Dharma.
PURPORT
The universal form of the Lord is the cosmic manifestation, which is an exhibition of the external
energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In space there are innumerable varieties of planets and
also the air, and in the air there are variously colored clouds, and sometimes we see airplanes running
from one place to another. Thus the entire cosmic manifestation is full of variety, but actually that variety
is a manifestation of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and that energy is situated in Him. Now the
Lord Himself, after manifesting His energy, appeared within the creation of His energy, which is
simultaneously one with and different from Himself, and therefore the demigods offered their respects to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who manifests Himself in such varieties. There are some
philosophers, called nondualists, who because of their impersonal conception think that varieties are
false. ln this verse it is specifically stated, yo mayaya viracitam. This indicates that the varieties are a
manifestation of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus because the energy is
nondifferent from the Godhead, the varieties are also factual. The material varieties may be temporary, but
they are not false. They are a reflection of the spiritual varieties. Here the word praticaksanaya, "there are
varieties," announces the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as Nara-Narayana
Rsi and who is the origin of all varieties of material nature.
