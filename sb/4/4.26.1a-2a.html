body; asti--there is; prajna--intelligence; samayatta--resting on; kah--what; visesah--difference; tada--then;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A desire to maintain body, wife and children is also observed in animal society. The animals have full
intelligence to manage such affairs. If a human being is simply advanced in this respect, what is the
difference between him and an animal? One should be very careful to understand that this human life is
attained after many, many births in the evolutionary process. A learned man who gives up the bodily
conception of life, both gross and subtle, will, by the enlightenment of spiritual knowledge, become a
prominent individual spirit soul, as the Supreme Lord is also.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that man is a rational animal, but from this verse we can also understand that rationality exists
even in animal life. Unless there is rationality, how can an animal maintain its body by working so hard?
That the animals are not rational is untrue; their rationality, however, is not very advanced. In any case,
we cannot deny them rationality. The point is that one should use one's reason to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, for that is the perfection of human life.
