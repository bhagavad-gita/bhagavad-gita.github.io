<h2>Text</h2>
adya nas tamasah paras
tvayopasaditah prabho
bhramyatam nasta-drstinam
karmabhir daiva-samjnitaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
adya--today; nah--of us; tamasah--of the darkness of material existence; parah--the other side; tvaya--by
you; upasaditah--increased; prabho--O lord; bhramyatam--who are wandering; nasta-drstinam--who have
lost their goal of life; karmabhih--on account of past deeds; daiva-samjnitaih--arranged by superior
authority.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The citizens continued: Today you have opened our eyes and revealed how to cross to the other side of
the ocean of darkness. By our past deeds and by the arrangement of superior authority, we are entangled
in a network of fruitive activities and have lost sight of the destination of life; thus we have been
wandering within the universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, the words karmabhir daiva-samjnitaih are very significant. Due to the quality of our
actions, we come to the association of the modes of material nature, and by superior arrangement we are
given a chance to enjoy the fruitive results of such activities in different types of bodies. In this way,
having lost sight of their destinations in life, all living entities are wandering in different species
throughout the universe, sometimes getting birth in a lower species and sometimes existence in higher
planetary systems; thus we are all wandering since time immemorial. It is by the grace of the spiritual
master and the Supreme personality of Godhead that we get the clue of devotional life, and thus
progressive success in our life begins. Here this is admitted by the citizens of King Prthu; in full
consciousness they admit the benefit they have derived from the activities of Maharaja Prthu.
