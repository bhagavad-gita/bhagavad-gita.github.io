<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way King Puranjana killed many animals, including rabbits, boars, buffalo, bison, black deer,
porcupines and other game animals. After killing and killing, the King became very tired.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A person in the mode of ignorance commits many sinful activities. In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, Srila
Rupa Gosvami explains that a man becomes sinful out of ignorance only. The resultant effect of sinful life
is suffering. Those who are not in knowledge, who commit violations of the standard laws, are subject to
be punished under criminal laws. Similarly, the laws of nature are very stringent. If a child touches fire
without knowing the effect, he must be burned, even though he is only a child. If a child violates the law
of nature, there is no compassion. Only through ignorance does a person violate the laws of nature, and
when he comes to knowledge he does not commit any more sinful acts.
The King became tired after killing so many animals. When a man comes in contact with a saintly
person, he becomes aware of the stringent laws of nature and thus becomes a religious person. Irreligious
persons are like animals, but in this Krsna consciousness movement such persons can come to a sense of
understanding things as they are and abandon the four principles of prohibited activities--namely illicit
sex life, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. This is the beginning of religious life. Those who are socalled
religious and indulge in these four principles of prohibited activities are pseudoreligionists.
Religious life and sinful activity cannot parallel one another. If one is serious in accepting a religious life,
or the path of salvation, he must adhere to the four basic rules and regulations. However sinful a man may
be, if he receives knowledge from the proper spiritual master and repents his past activities in his sinful
life and stops them, he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is made
possible just by following the rules and regulations given by the sastra and following the bona fide
spiritual master.
At present the whole world is on the verge of retiring from a blind materialistic civilization, which may
be likened to hunting animals in the forest. People should take advantage of this Krsna consciousness
movement and leave their troublesome life of killing. It is said that the killers of animals should neither
live nor die. If they live only to kill animals and enjoy women, life is not very prosperous. And as soon as
a killer dies, he enters the cycle of birth and death in the lower species of life. That also is not desirable.
The conclusion is that killers should retire from the killing business and take to this Krsna consciousness
movement to make life perfect. A confused, frustrated man cannot get relief by committing suicide
because suicide will simply lead him to take birth in the lower species of life or to remain a ghost, unable
to attain a gross material body. Therefore the perfect course is to retire altogether from sinful activities
and take up Krsna consciousness. In this way one can become completely perfect and go back home, back
to Godhead.
