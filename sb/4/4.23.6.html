<h2>Translation</h2>
If a king is too attracted to eating flesh, he may, according to the directions of the revealed scriptures on
sacrificial performances, go to the forest and kill some animals that are recommended for killing. One is
not allowed to kill animals unnecessarily or without restrictions. The Vedas regulate animal-killing to stop
the extravagance of foolish men influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The question may be raised why a living being should be restricted in sense gratification. If a king, to
learn how to kill, may go to the forest and kill animals, why should a living entity, who has been given
senses, not be allowed unrestricted sense gratification? At the present moment this argument is put
forward even by so-called svamis and yogis who publicly say that because we have senses we must satisfy
them by sense gratification. These foolish svamis and yogis, however, do not know the injunctions of the
sastras. Indeed, sometimes these rascals come out to defy the sastras. They even publicly announce that
there should be no more sastras, no more books. "Just come to me," they say, "and I shall touch you, and
you will become immediately spiritually advanced."
Because demoniac people want to be cheated, so many cheaters are present to cheat them. At the
present moment in this age of Kali-yuga, the entire human society has become an assembly of cheaters
and cheated. For this reason the Vedic scriptures have given us the proper directions for sense
gratification. Everyone is inclined in this age to eat meat and fish, drink liquor and indulge in sex life, but
according to the Vedic injunctions, sex is allowed only in marriage, meat-eating is allowed only when the
animal is killed and offered before the goddess Kali, and intoxication is allowed only in a restricted way.
In this verse the word niyamyate indicates that all these things--namely animal-killing, intoxication and
sex--should be regulated.
Regulations are meant for human beings, not for animals. The traffic regulations on the street, telling
people to keep to the right or the left, are meant for human beings, not for animals. If an animal violates
such a law, he is never punished, but a human being is punished. The Vedas are not meant for the
animals, but for the understanding of human society. A person who indiscriminately violates the rules and
regulations given by the Vedas is liable to be punished. One should therefore not enjoy his senses
according to his lusty desires, but should restrict himself according to the regulative principles given in
the Vedas. If a king is allowed to hunt in a forest, it is not for his sense gratification. We cannot simply
experiment in the art of killing. If a king, being afraid to meet rogues and thieves, kills poor animals and
eats their flesh comfortably at home, he must lose his position. Because in this age kings have such
demoniac propensities, monarchy is abolished by the laws of nature in every country.
people have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the
other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless
girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment
in modern society. The Vedas enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one
wife--as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the brahmanas, ksatriyas
and vaisyas, and even sometimes the sudras--he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means
taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment,
however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more
than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.
