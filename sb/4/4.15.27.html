<h2>Text</h2>
diso vijityapratiruddha-cakrah
sva-tejasotpatita-loka-salyah
surasurendrair upagiyamanamahanubhavo
bhavita patir bhuvah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
disah--all directions; vijitya--conquering; apratiruddha--without check; cakrah--his influence or power;
sva-tejasa--by his own prowess; utpatita--uprooted; loka-salyah--the miseries of the citizens; sura--of
demigods; asura--of demons; indraih--by the chiefs; upagiyamana--being glorified; maha-anubhavah--the
great soul; bhavita--he will become; patih--the lord; bhuvah--of the world.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
No one will be able to disobey the orders of Prthu Maharaja. After conquering the world, he will
completely eradicate the threefold miseries of the citizens. Then he will be recognized all over the world.
At that time both the suras and the asuras will undoubtedly glorify his magnanimous activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the time of Maharaja Prthu, the world was ruled by one emperor, although there were many
subordinate states. Just as there are many united states in various parts of the world, in olden days the
entire world was ruled through many states, but there was a supreme emperor who ruled over all
subsidiary states. As soon as there were some discrepancies in the maintenance of the varnasrama system,
the emperor would immediately take charge of the small states.
The word utpatita-loka-salyah indicates that Maharaja Prthu completely uprooted all the miseries of his
citizens. The word salya means "piercing thorns." There are many kinds of miserable thorns that pierce
the citizens of a state, but all competent rulers, even up to the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, uprooted all
the miserable conditions of the citizens. It is stated that during the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira there
did not even exist severe cold or scorching heat, nor did the citizens suffer from any kind of mental
anxiety. This is the standard of good government. Such a peaceful and prosperous government, devoid of
anxiety, was established by Prthu Maharaja. Thus the inhabitants of both saintly and demoniac planets
were all engaged in glorifying the activities of Maharaja Prthu. Persons or nations anxious to spread their
influence all over the world should consider this point. If one is able to eradicate completely the threefold
miseries of the citizens, he should aspire to rule the world. One should not aspire to rule for any political
or diplomatic consideration.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Sixteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Praise of King Prthu by the Professional Reciters."
