<h2>Translation</h2>
You are all devotees of the Lord, and as such I appreciate that you are as respectable as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Himself. I know in this way that the devotees also respect me and that I am dear
to them. Thus no one can be as dear to the devotees as I am.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said, vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh: Lord Siva is the best of all devotees. Therefore all devotees of
Lord Krsna are also devotees of Lord Siva. In Vrndavana there is Lord Siva's temple called Gopisvara. The
gopis used to worship not only Lord Siva but Katyayani, or Durga, as well, but their aim was to attain the
favor of Lord Krsna. A devotee of Lord Krsna does not disrespect Lord Siva, but worships Lord Siva as the
most exalted devotee of Lord Krsna. Consequently whenever a devotee worships Lord Siva, he prays to
Lord Siva to achieve the favor of Krsna, and he does not request material profit. In Bhagavad-gita (7.20) it
is said that generally people worship demigods for some material profit. Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah.
Driven by material lust, they worship demigods, but a devotee never does so, for he is never driven by
material lust. That is the difference between a devotee's respect for Lord Siva and an asura's respect for
him. The asura worships Lord Siva, takes some benediction from him, misuses the benediction and
ultimately is killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards him liberation.
Because Lord Siva is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he loves all the devotees of
the Supreme Lord. Lord Siva told the Pracetas that because they were devotees of the Lord, he loved them
very much. Lord Siva was not kind and merciful only to the Pracetas; anyone who is a devotee of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to Lord Siva. Not only are the devotees dear to Lord Siva,
but he respects them as much as he respects the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, devotees of
the Supreme Lord also worship Lord Siva as the most dear devotee of Lord Krsna. They do not worship
him as a separate Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the list of nama-aparadhas that it is an offense to
think that the chanting of the name of Hari and the chanting of Hara, or Siva, are the same. The devotees
must always know that Lord Visnu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that Lord Siva is His
devotee. A devotee should be offered respect on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
sometimes even more respect. Indeed, Lord Rama, the Personality of Godhead Himself, sometimes
worshiped Lord Siva. If a devotee is worshiped by the Lord, why should a devotee not be worshiped by
other devotees on the same level with the Lord? This is the conclusion. From this verse it appears that
Lord Siva blesses the asuras simply for the sake of formality. Actually he loves one who is devoted to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
