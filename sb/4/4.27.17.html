<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord then blessed all the Pracetas, saying: My dear princes, by My mercy, you can enjoy all the
facilities of this world as well as the heavenly world. Indeed, you can enjoy all of them without hindrance
and with full strength for one million celestial years.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The duration of life prescribed for the Pracetas by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calculated by
the time measurements of higher planetary systems. Our six earth months are said to equal twelve hours
in the higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve months equal one year. In this
way, for one million years according to the calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracetas were
allowed to enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this life-span was so long, the Pracetas were
given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the material world, if one wants to live for many
years, he must endure the difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions. The
Pracetas, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material facilities. This special facility was
given to the Pracetas so that they could continue rendering full devotional service. This will be explained
in the following verse.
