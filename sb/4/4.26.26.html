<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Queen, due to my sinful desires I went to the forest to hunt without asking you. Therefore I
must admit that I have offended you. Nonetheless, thinking of me as your most intimate subordinate, you
should still be very much pleased with me. Factually I am very much bereaved, but being pierced by the
arrow of Cupid, I am feeling lusty. But where is the beautiful woman who would give up her lusty
husband and refuse to unite with him?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both man and woman desire one another; that is the basic principle of material existence. Women in
general always keep themselves beautiful so that they can be attractive to their lusty husbands. When a
lusty husband comes before his wife, the wife takes advantage of his aggressive activities and enjoys life.
Generally when a woman is attacked by a man--whether her husband or some other man--she enjoys the
attack, being too lusty. In other words, when one's intelligence is properly utilized, both the intellect and
the intelligent person enjoy one another with great satisfaction. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.9.45):
yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham
kanduyanena karayor iva duhkha-duhkham
The actual happiness of the karmis is sex life. They work very hard outside the home, and to satiate
their hard labor, they come home to enjoy sex life. King Puranjana went to the forest to hunt, and after
his hard labor he returned home to enjoy sex life. If a man lives outside the home and spends a week in a
city or somewhere else, at the end of the week he becomes very anxious to return home and enjoy sex
with his wife. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam: yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham.
Karmis work very hard simply to enjoy sex. Modern human society has improved the materialistic way of
life simply by inducing unrestricted sex life in many different ways. This is most prominently visible in
the Western world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "King Puranjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt, and His Queen Becomes Angry."
