bhagavad-dharminah sadhoh
sraddhaya yatatah sada
bhaktir bhagavati brahmany
ananya-visayabhavat
SYNONYMS
bhagavat-dharminah--one who executes devotional service; sadhoh--of the devotee; sraddhaya--with
faith; yatatah--endeavoring; sada--always; bhaktih--devotion; bhagavati--unto the Personality of Godhead;
brahmani--the origin of impersonal Brahman; ananya-visaya--firmly fixed without deviation; abhavat--
became.
TRANSLATION
Maharaja Prthu thus engaged completely in devotional service, executing the rules and regulations
strictly according to principles, twenty-four hours daily. Thus his love and devotion unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, developed and became unflinching and fixed.
PURPORT
The word bhagavad-dharminah indicates that the religious process practiced by Maharaja Prthu was
beyond all pretensions. As stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.2), dharmah projjhitakaitavo
'tra: religious principles which are simply pretentious are actually nothing but cheating. Bhagavaddharminah
is described by Viraraghava Acarya as nivrtta-dharmena, which indicates that it cannot be
contaminated by material aspiration. As described by Srila Rupa Gosvami:
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
When one who is not inspired by material desires and is not contaminated by the processes of fruitive
activity and empiric speculation fully engages in the favorable service of the Lord, his service is called
bhagavad-dharma, or pure devotional service. In this verse the word brahmani does not refer to the
impersonal Brahman. Impersonal Brahman is a subordinate feature of the Supreme personality of
Godhead, and since impersonal Brahman worshipers desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence, they
cannot be considered followers of bhagavad-dharma. After being baffled in his material enjoyment, the
impersonalist may desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, but a pure devotee of the Lord has no
such desire. Therefore a pure devotee is really bhagavad-dharmi.
It is clear from this verse that Maharaja Prthu was never a worshiper of the impersonal Brahman but was
at all times a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhagavati brahmani refers to one who
is engaged in devotional service to the Personality of Godhead. A devotee's knowledge of the impersonal
Brahman is automatically revealed, and he is not interested in merging into the impersonal Brahman.
Maharaja Prthu's activities in devotional service enabled him to become fixed and steady in the discharge
of devotional activities without having to take recourse to karma, jnana or yoga.
