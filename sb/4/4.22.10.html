<h2>Text</h2>
adhana api te dhanyah
sadhavo grha-medhinah
yad-grha hy arha-varyambutrna-
bhumisvaravarah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
adhanah--not very rich; api--although; te--they; dhanyah--glorious; sadhavah--saintly persons; grhamedhinah--
persons who are attached to family life; yat-grhah--whose house; hi--certainly; arha-varya--the
most worshipable; ambu--water; trna--grass; bhumi--land; isvara--the master; avarah--the servants.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A person who is not very rich and is attached to family life becomes highly glorified when saintly
persons are present in his home. The master and servants who are engaged in offering the exalted visitors
water, a sitting place and paraphernalia for reception are glorified, and the home itself is also glorified.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materially if a man is not very rich, he is not glorious, and spiritually if a man is too attached to family
life, he is also not glorious. But saintly persons are quite ready to visit the house of a poor man or a man
who is attached to material family life. When this happens, the owner of the house and his servants are
glorified because they offer water for washing the feet of a saintly person, sitting places and other things
to receive him. The conclusion is that if a saintly person goes to the house of even an unimportant man,
such a person becomes glorious by his blessings. It is therefore the Vedic system that a householder invite
a saintly person in his home to receive his blessings. This system is still current in India, and therefore
saintly persons, wherever they go, are hosted by the householders, who in turn get an opportunity to
receive transcendental knowledge. It is the duty of a sannyasi, therefore, to travel everywhere just to favor
the householders, who are generally ignorant of the values of spiritual life.
It may be argued that all householders are not very rich and that one cannot receive great saintly
persons or preachers because they are always accompanied by their disciples. If a householder is to
receive a saintly person, he has to receive his entourage also. It is said in the sastras that Durvasa Muni
was always accompanied by sixty thousand disciples and that if there was a little discrepancy in their
reception, he would be very angry and would sometimes curse the host. The fact is that every
householder, regardless of his position or economic condition, can at least receive saintly guests with
great devotion and offer them drinking water, for drinking water is available always. In India the custom
is that even an ordinary person is offered a glass of water if he suddenly visits and one cannot offer him
foodstuff. If there is no water, then one can offer a sitting place, even if it is on straw mats. And if one has
no straw mat, he can immediately cleanse the ground and ask the guest to sit there. Supposing that a
householder cannot even do that, then with folded hands he can simply receive the guest, saying,
"Welcome." And if he cannot do that, then he should feel very sorry for his poor condition and shed tears
and simply offer obeisances with his whole family, wife and children. In this way he can satisfy any guest,
even if the guest is a saintly person or a king.
