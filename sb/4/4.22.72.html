<h2>Text</h2>
idam aha purasmakam
bhagavan visvasrk-patih
bhrgv-adinam atmajanam
sisrksuh samsisrksatam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
idam--this; aha--said; pura--formerly; asmakam--unto us; bhagavan--the lord; visva-srk--the creators of
the universe; patih--master; bhrgu-adinam--of the great sages headed by Bhrgu; atmajanam--of his sons;
sisrksuh--desirous of creating; samsisrksatam--who are in charge of creation.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This prayer was first spoken to us by Lord Brahma, the master of all creators. The creators, headed by
Bhrgu, were instructed in these prayers because they wanted to create.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma was created by Lord Visnu; then Lord Brahma created Lord Siva and other great sages,
headed by Bhrgu Muni. These great sages included Bhrgu, Marici, Atreya, Vasistha and others. All these
great sages were in charge of creating population. Since there were not very many living entities in the
beginning, Visnu entrusted Brahma with the business of creation, and Brahma in his turn created many
hundreds and thousands of demigods and great sages to continue with the creation. At the same time,
Lord Brahma cautioned all his sons and disciples by reciting the prayers now recited by Lord Siva. The
material creation means material engagement, but material engagements can be counteracted if we always
remember our relationship with the Lord as that relationship is described in these prayers recited by Lord
Siva. In this way we can remain constantly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus
despite our engagement in the creation, we cannot be deviated from the path of Krsna consciousness. The
Krsna consciousness movement is especially meant for this purpose. In this material world everyone is
engaged in some particular occupational duty which is prescribed in the varnasrama-dharma. Brahmanas,
ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras and everyone are engaged in their occupational duty, but if one remembers his
first duty--keeping in constant contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead--everything will be
successful. If one simply executes the rules and regulations of the varnasrama-dharma in the role of a
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and keeps busy and does not remember one's eternal relationship with
the Lord, one's business and activities as well as occupational duties will simply be a waste of time. This is
confirmed in the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8):
dharmah svanusthitah pumsam
visvaksena-kathasu yah
notpadayed yadi ratim
srama eva hi kevalam
The conclusion is that even if one is busy executing his occupational duty, his business in Krsna
consciousness need not be hampered. He has simply to execute the devotional service of sravanam
kirtanam--hearing, chanting and remembering. One need not abandon his occupational duty. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (18.46):
yatah pravrttir bhutanam
yena sarvam idam tatam
sva-karmana tam abhyarcya
siddhim vindati manavah
"By worship of the Lord--who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading--man can, in the
performance of his own duty, attain perfection."
Thus one can continue with his occupational duty, but if he worships the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as Lord Siva herein prescribes, he attains his perfection of life. Svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam (Bhag. 1.2.13). We should continue executing our occupational duties, but if we
try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by our duties, then our lives will be perfected.
