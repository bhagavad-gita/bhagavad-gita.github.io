<h2>Translation</h2>
As long as he remained at home, Dhruva Maharaja performed many great ceremonial sacrifices in order
to please the enjoyer of all sacrifices, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prescribed ceremonial
sacrifices are especially meant to please Lord Visnu, who is the objective of all such sacrifices and who
awards the resultant benedictions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (3.9) it is said, yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: one should act
or work only in order to please the Supreme Lord, otherwise one becomes entangled in the resultant
reactions. According to the four divisions of varna and asrama, ksatriyas and vaisyas are especially advised
to perform great ceremonial sacrifices and to distribute their accumulated money very liberally. Dhruva
Maharaja, as a king and ideal ksatriya, performed many such sacrifices, giving very liberally in charity.
Ksatriyas and vaisyas are supposed to earn their money and accumulate great riches. Sometimes they do it
by acting sinfully. Ksatriyas are meant to rule over a country; Dhruva Maharaja, for example, in the course
of ruling, had to fight and kill many Yaksas. Such action is necessary for ksatriyas. A ksatriya should not
be a coward, and he should not be nonviolent; to rule over the country he has to act violently.
Ksatriyas and vaisyas are therefore especially advised to give in charity at least fifty percent of their
accumulated wealth. In Bhagavad-gita it is recommended that even though one enters the renounced
order of life, he still cannot give up the performance of yajna, dana and tapasya. They are never to be
given up. Tapasya is meant for the renounced order of life; those who are retired from worldly activities
should perform tapasya, penances and austerities. Those who are in the material world, the ksatriyas and
vaisyas, must give charity. Brahmacaris, in the beginning of their lives, should perform different kinds of
yajnas.
Dhruva Maharaja, as an ideal king, practically emptied his treasury by giving charity. A king is not
meant simply to realize taxes from the citizens and accumulate wealth to spend in sense gratification.
World monarchy has failed ever since kings began to satisfy their personal senses with the taxes
accumulated from the citizens. Of course, whether the system is monarchy or democracy, the same
corruption is still going on. At the present moment there are different parties in the democratic
government, but everyone is busy trying to keep his post or trying to keep his political party in power.
The politicians have very little time to think of the welfare of the citizens, whom they oppress with heavy
taxes in the form of income tax, sales tax and many other taxes--people sometimes have eighty to ninety
percent of their income taken away, and these taxes are lavishly spent for the high salaries drawn by the
officers and rulers. Formerly, the taxes accumulated from the citizens were spent for performing great
sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature. At the present moment, however, almost all forms of sacrifice
are not at all possible; therefore, it is recommended in the sastras that people should perform sankirtanayajna.
Any householder, regardless of his position, can perform this sankirtana-yajna without
expenditure. All the family members can sit down together and simply clap their hands and chant the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Somehow or other, everyone can manage to perform such a yajna and distribute
prasada to the people in general. That is quite sufficient for this age of Kali. The Krsna consciousness
movement is based on this principle: chant the Hare Krsna mantra at every moment, as much as possible,
both inside and outside of the temples, and, as far as possible, distribute prasada. This process can be
accelerated with the cooperation of state administrators and those who are producing the country's
wealth. Simply by liberal distribution of prasada and sankirtana, the whole world can become peaceful
and prosperous.
Generally in all the material sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature there are offerings to the
demigods. This demigod worship is especially meant for less intelligent men. Actually, the result of such
sacrifice goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (5.29),
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam: He is actually the enjoyer of all sacrifices. His name, therefore, is Yajna-purusa.
Although Dhruva Maharaja was a great devotee and had nothing to do with these sacrifices, to set an
example to his people he performed many sacrifices and gave all his wealth in charity. For as long as he
lived as a householder, he never spent a farthing for his sense gratification. In this verse the word karmaphala-
pradam is very significant. The Lord awards everyone different kinds of karma as the individual
living entities desire; He is the Supersoul present within the heart of everyone, and He is so kind and
liberal that He gives everyone full facilities to perform whatever acts one wants. Then the result of the
action is also enjoyed by the living entity. If anyone wants to enjoy or lord it over material nature, the
Lord gives him full facilities, but he becomes entangled in the resultant reactions. Similarly, if anyone
wants to engage himself fully in devotional service, the Lord gives him full facilities, and the devotee
enjoys the results. The Lord is therefore known as karma-phala-prada.
