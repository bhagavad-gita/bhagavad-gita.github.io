na vidama vayam samyak

gotram nama ca yat-krtam

human beings; atmanah--of myself; ca--and; parasya--of others; api--also; gotram--family history; nama--

TRANSLATION
The girl said: O best of human beings, I do not know who has begotten me. I cannot speak to you
perfectly about this. Nor do I know the names or the origin of the associates with me.
PURPORT
The living entity is ignorant of his origin. He does not know why this material world was created, why
others are working in this material world and what the ultimate source of this manifestation is. No one
knows the answers to these questions, and this is called ignorance. By researching into the origin of life,
important scientists are finding some chemical compositions or cellular combinations, but actually no one
knows the original source of life within this material world. The phrase brahma jijnasa is used to indicate
an inquisitiveness to know the original source of our existence in this material world. No philosopher,
scientist or politician actually knows wherefrom we have come, why we are here struggling so hard for
existence and where we will go. Generally people are of the opinion that we are all here accidentally and
that as soon as these bodies are finished all our dramatic activities will be finished and we will become
zero. Such scientists and philosophers are impersonalists and voidists. In this verse the girl is expressing
the actual position of the living entity. She cannot tell Puranjana her father's name because she does not
know from where she has come. Nor does she know why she is present in that place. She frankly says that
she does not know anything about all this. This is the position of the living entity in the material world.
There are so many scientists, philosophers and big leaders, but they do not know wherefrom they have
come, nor do they know why they are busy within this material world to obtain a position of so-called
happiness. In this material world we have many nice facilities for living, but we are so foolish that we do
not ask who has made this world habitable for us and has arranged it so nicely. Everything is functioning
in order, but people foolishly think that they are produced by chance in this material world and that after
death they will become zero. They think that this beautiful place of habitation will automatically remain.
