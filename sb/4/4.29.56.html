bhagavan yad abhasata
naitaj jananty upadhyayah

<br>

<h2>Translation</h2>
The King replied: My dear brahmana, whatever you have said I have heard with great attention and,
considering all of it, have come to the conclusion that the acaryas [teachers] who engaged me in fruitive
activity did not know this confidential knowledge. If they were aware of it, why did they not explain it to
me?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually the so-called teachers or leaders of material society do not really know the goal of life. They are
described in Bhagavad-gita as mayayapahrta jnanah. They appear to be very learned scholars, but actually
the influence of the illusory energy has taken away their knowledge. Real knowledge means searching out
Krsna. Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah. All Vedic knowledge is meant for searching out Krsna because
Krsna is the origin of everything. Janmady asya yatah. In Bhagavad-gita (10.2) Krsna says, aham adir hi
devanam: "I am the source of the demigods." Thus Krsna is the origin and beginning of all demigods,
including Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and all others. The Vedic ritualistic ceremonies are concerned with
satisfying different demigods, but unless one is very advanced, he cannot understand that the original
personality is Sri Krsna. Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. After hearing the instructions of
Narada, King Barhisman came to his senses. The real goal of life is to attain devotional service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The King therefore decided to reject the so-called priestly orders that
simply engage their followers in the ritualistic ceremonies without giving effective instructions about the
goal of life. At the present moment the churches, temples and mosques all over the world are not
attracting people because foolish priests cannot elevate their followers to the platform of knowledge. Not
being aware of the real goal of life, they simply keep their congregations in ignorance. Consequently,
those who are well educated have become uninterested in the ritualistic ceremonies. At the same time,
they are not benefited with real knowledge. This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore very
important for the enlightenment of all classes. Following in the footsteps of Maharaja Barhisman,
everyone should take advantage of this Krsna consciousness movement and abandon the stereotyped
ritualistic ceremonies that go under the garb of so many religions. The Gosvamis from the very beginning
differed from the priestly class that was engaged in ritualistic ceremonies. Indeed, Srila Sanatana Gosvami
compiled his Hari-bhakti-vilasa for the guidance of the Vaisnavas. The Vaisnavas, not caring for the
lifeless activities of the priestly classes, take to full Krsna consciousness and become perfect in this very
life. That is described in the previous verse as paramahamsa-saranam, taking shelter of the paramahamsa,
the liberated soul, and becoming successful in this life.
