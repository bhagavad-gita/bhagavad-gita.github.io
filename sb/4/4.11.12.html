<h2>Text</h2>
tam evam sila-sampannam
brahmanyam dina-vatsalam
goptaram dharma-setunam
menire pitaram prajah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him; evam--thus; sila--with godly qualities; sampannam--endowed; brahmanyam--respectful to the
brahmanas; dina--to the poor; vatsalam--kind; goptaram--protector; dharma-setunam--of religious
principles; menire--thought; pitaram--father; prajah--the citizens.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja was endowed with all godly qualities; he was very respectful to the devotees of the
Supreme Lord and very kind to the poor and innocent, and he protected religious principles. With all
these qualifications, he was considered to be the direct father of all the citizens.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The personal qualities of Dhruva Maharaja described herein are the exemplary qualities of a saintly
king. Not only a king but also the leaders of a modern democratic or impersonal government must be
qualified with all these godly characteristics. Then the citizens of the state can be happy. It is clearly stated
here that the citizens thought of Dhruva Maharaja as their father; as a child, depending on the able father,
is completely satisfied, so the citizens of the state, being protected by the state or the king, should remain
satisfied in every respect. At the present moment, however, there is no guarantee by the government of
even the primary necessities of life in the state, namely, the protection of the lives and property of the
citizens.
One word is very significant in this connection: brahmanyam. Dhruva Maharaja was very devoted to the
brahmanas, who engage in the study of the Vedas and thereby know the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
They are always busy propagating Krsna consciousness. The state should be very respectful to societies
that distribute God consciousness all over the world, but, unfortunately, at the present moment there is
no state or government support given to such movements. As for good qualities, it is very difficult to find
anyone in state administration with any good qualities. The administrators simply sit in their
administrative posts and say no to every request, as if they were paid to say no to the citizens. Another
word, dina-vatsalam, is very significant also. The state head should be very kind to the innocent.
Unfortunately, in this age the state agents and the presidents draw good salaries from the state, and they
pose themselves as very pious, but they allow the running of slaughterhouses, where innocent animals are
killed. If we try to compare the godly qualities of Dhruva Maharaja to the qualities of modern statesmen,
we can see that there is no actual comparison. Dhruva Maharaja was present in the Satya-yuga, as will be
clear from the next verses. He was the ideal king in Satya-yuga. The government administration in the
present age (Kali-yuga) is bereft of all godly qualities. Considering all these points, the people today have
no alternative but to take to Krsna consciousness for protection of religion, life and property.
