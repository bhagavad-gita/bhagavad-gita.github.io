<h2>Text</h2>
lokantaram gatavati
mayy anatha kutumbini
vartisyate katham tv esa
balakan anusocati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
loka-antaram--into a different life; gatavati mayi--when I am gone; anatha--bereft of husband;
kutumbini--surrounded by all family members; vartisyate--will exist; katham--how; tu--then; esa--this
woman; balakan--children; anusocati--lamenting about.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana was anxiously thinking, "Alas, my wife is encumbered by so many children. When I
pass from this body, how will she be able to maintain all these family members? Alas, she will be greatly
harassed by thoughts of family maintenance."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All these thoughts of one's wife indicate that the King was overly engrossed with the thoughts of
woman. Generally a chaste woman becomes a very obedient wife. This causes a husband to become
attached to his wife, and consequently he thinks of his wife very much at the time of death. This is a very
dangerous situation, as is evident from the life of King Puranjana. If one thinks of his wife instead of
Krsna at the time of death, he will certainly not return home, back to Godhead, but will be forced to
accept the body of a woman and thus begin another chapter of material existence.
