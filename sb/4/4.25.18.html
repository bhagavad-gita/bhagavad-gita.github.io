SYNONYMS
sah--he; eva--certainly; puryam--within the city; madhu-bhuk--enjoying sex life; pancalesu--in the
kingdom of Pancala (five sense objects); sva-parsadaih--along with his followers; upanitam--brought;
balim--taxes; grhnan--accepting; stri-jitah--conquered by women; na--did not; avidat--understand;
bhayam--fear of death.
TRANSLATION
King Puranjana collected taxes in the city known as Pancala and thus was able to engage in sexual
indulgence. Being completely under the control of women, he could not understand that his life was
passing away and that he was reaching the point of death.
PURPORT
Government men--including kings, presidents, secretaries and ministers--are in a position to utilize
taxes collected from the citizens for sense gratification. It is stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam that in this Kaliyuga
government men (rajanyas) and those connected with the government, as well as exalted
government ministers, secretaries and presidents, will all simply collect taxes for sense gratification. The
government is top-heavy, and without increasing taxes the government cannot maintain itself. When
taxes are collected they are utilized for the sense gratification of the government officials. Such
irresponsible politicians forget that there is a time when death will come to take away all their sense
gratification. Some of them are convinced that after life everything is finished. This atheistic theory was
conceived long ago by a philosopher called Carvaka. Carvaka recommended that man should live very
opulently by either begging, borrowing or stealing. He also maintained that one should not be afraid of
death, the next life, the past life or an impious life because after the body is burnt to ashes, everything is
finished. This is the philosophy of those who are too much materially addicted. Such philosophizing will
not save one from the danger of death, nor will it save one from an abominable afterlife.
