<h2>Text</h2>
prakarair gopuragaraih
satakumbha-paricchadaih
sarvato 'lankrtam srimadvimana-
sikhara-dyubhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prakaraih--with surrounding walls; gopura--city gates; agaraih--with houses; satakumbha--golden;
paricchadaih--with ornamental work; sarvatah--on all sides; alankrtam--decorated; srimat--valuable,
beautiful; vimana--airplanes; sikhara--domes; dyubhih--glittering.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the capital city there were many palaces, city gates and surrounding walls, which were already very,
very beautiful, and on this occasion all of them were decorated with golden ornaments. The domes of the
city palaces glittered, as did the domes of the beautiful airplanes which hovered over the city.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Regarding the mention of airplanes here, it is suggested by Srimad Vijayadhvaja Tirtha that on this
occasion the demigods from higher planetary systems also came in their airplanes to bestow their
blessings on Dhruva Maharaja on his arrival at the capital of his father. It also appears that all the domes
of the city palaces as well as the pinnacles of the airplanes were decorated with ornamental work in gold,
and, being reflected by the sunshine, they were all glittering. We can observe a specific distinction
between Dhruva Maharaja's time and modern days, for the airplanes in those days were made of gold,
whereas at the present moment airplanes are made of base aluminum. This just gives a hint of the
opulence of Dhruva Maharaja's days and the poverty of modern times.
