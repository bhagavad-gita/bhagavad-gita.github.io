<h2>Text</h2>
tayopagudhah parirabdha-kandharo
raho 'numantrair apakrsta-cetanah
na kala-ramho bubudhe duratyayam
diva niseti pramada-parigrahah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
taya--by the Queen; upagudhah--was embraced; parirabdha--embraced; kandharah--shoulders; rahah--in
a solitary place; anumantraih--by joking words; apakrsta-cetanah--having degraded consciousness; na--
not; kala-ramhah--the passing of time; bubudhe--was aware of; duratyayam--impossible to overcome;
diva--day; nisa--night; iti--thus; pramada--by the woman; parigrahah--captivated.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Queen Puranjani embraced the King, and the King also responded by embracing her shoulders. In this
way, in a solitary place, they enjoyed joking words. Thus King Puranjana became very much captivated by
his beautiful wife and deviated from his good sense. He forgot that the passing of days and nights meant
that his span of life was being reduced without profit.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word pramada in this verse is very significant. A beautiful wife is certainly enlivening to her
husband, but at the same time is the cause of degradation. The word pramada means "enlivening" as well
as "maddening." Generally a householder does not take the passing of days and nights very seriously. A
person in ignorance takes it as the usual course that days come, and after the days, the nights come. This
is the law of material nature. But a man in ignorance does not know that when the sun rises early in the
morning it begins to take away the balance of his life. Thus day after day the span of one's life is reduced,
and forgetting the duty of human life, the foolish man simply remains in the company of his wife and
enjoys her in a secluded place. Such a condition is called apakrsta-cetana, or degraded consciousness.
Human consciousness should be used for elevation to Krsna consciousness. But when a person is too
much attracted to his wife and family affairs, he does not take Krsna consciousness very seriously. He thus
becomes degraded, not knowing that he cannot buy back even a second of his life in return for millions of
dollars. The greatest loss in life is passing time without understanding Krsna. Every moment of our lives
should be utilized properly, and the proper use of life is to increase devotional service to the Lord.
Without devotional service to the Lord, the activities of life become simply a waste of time. Srama eva hi
kevalam. Simply by becoming "dutiful" we do not make any profit in life. As confirmed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.8):
dharmah svanusthitah pumsam
visvaksena-kathasu yah
notpadayed yadi ratim
srama eva hi kevalam
If, after performing one's occupational duty very perfectly, one does not make progress in Krsna
consciousness, it should be understood that he has simply wasted his time in valueless labor.
