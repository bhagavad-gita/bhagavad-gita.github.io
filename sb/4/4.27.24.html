<h2>Translation</h2>
Approaching the King of the Yavanas, Kalakanya addressed him as a great hero, saying: My dear sir, you
are the best of the untouchables. I am in love with you, and I want you as my husband. I know that no
one is baffled if he makes friends with you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words yavananam rsabham refer to the King of the Yavanas. The Sanskrit words yavana and
mleccha apply to those who do not follow the Vedic principles. According to the Vedic principles, one
should rise early in the morning, take bath, chant Hare Krsna, offer mangala-arati to the Deities, study
Vedic literature, take prasada and engage in dressing and decorating the Deities. One must also collect
money for the temple expenditures, or if one is a householder he must go to work in accordance with the
prescribed duties of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra. In this way one should live a life of spiritual
understanding, and this is the Vedic way of civilization. One who does not follow all these rules and
regulations is called a yavana or mleccha. One should not mistakenly think that these words refer to
certain classes of men in other countries. There is no question of limitation according to nationalism.
Whether one lives in India or outside of India, he is called a yavana or mleccha if he does not follow the
Vedic principles. One who does not actually follow the hygienic principles prescribed in the Vedic rules
and regulations will be subjected to many contagious diseases. Because the students in this Krsna
consciousness movement are advised to follow the Vedic principles, they naturally become hygienic.
If a person is Krsna conscious, he can work like a young man even if he is seventy-five or eighty years
old. Thus the daughter of Kala (Time) cannot overcome a Vaisnava. Srila Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami
engaged in writing Caitanya-caritamrta when he was very old, yet he presented the most wonderful
literature about the activities of Lord Caitanya. Srila Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami began their
spiritual lives at a very old age, that is, after they retired from their occupations and family lives. Yet they
presented many valuable literatures for the advancement of spiritual life. This is confirmed by Srila
Srinivasa Acarya, who praised the Gosvamis in this way:
nana-sastra-vicaranaika-nipunau sad-dharma-samsthapakau
lokanam hita-karinau tri-bhuvane manyau saranyakarau
radha-krsna-padaravinda-bhajananandena mattalikau
vande rupa-sanatanau raghu-yugau sri-jiva-gopalakau
"I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Rupa
Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami, Sri Jiva Gosvami and Sri Gopala
Bhatta Gosvami, who are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the aim of
establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. Thus they are honored all over
the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the gopis
and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Radha and Krsna."
Thus jara, the effect of old age, does not harass a devotee. This is because a devotee follows the
instructions and the determination of Narada Muni. All devotees are in the disciplic succession stemming
from Narada Muni because they worship the Deity according to Narada Muni's direction, namely the
Narada-pancaratra, or the pancaratrika-vidhi. A devotee follows the principles of pancaratrika-vidhi as
well as bhagavata-vidhi. Bhagavata-vidhi includes preaching work--sravanam kirtanam visnoh--the
hearing and chanting of the glories of Lord Visnu, the Supreme personality of Godhead. The pancaratrikavidhi
includes arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. Because a devotee rigidly follows
the instructions of Narada Muni, he has no fear of old age, disease or death. Apparently a devotee may
grow old, but he is not subjected to the symptoms of defeat experienced by a common man in old age.
Consequently, old age does not make a devotee fearful of death, as a common man is fearful of death.
When jara, or old age, takes shelter of a devotee, Kalakanya diminishes the devotee's fear. A devotee
knows that after death he is going back home, back to Godhead; therefore he has no fear of death. Thus
instead of depressing a devotee, advanced age helps him become fearless and thus happy.
