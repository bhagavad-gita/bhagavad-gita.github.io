<h2>Text</h2>
namo visuddha-sattvaya
haraye hari-medhase
vasudevaya krsnaya
prabhave sarva-satvatam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
namah--obeisances; visuddha-sattvaya--unto You, whose existence is free from all material influence;
haraye--who takes away all miserable conditions of devotees; hari-medhase--whose brain works only for
the deliverance of the conditioned soul; vasudevaya--the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead;
krsnaya--unto Krsna; prabhave--who increases the influence; sarva-satvatam--of all kinds of devotees.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, we offer our respectful obeisances unto You because Your existence is completely
independent of all material influences. Your Lordship always takes away the devotee's miserable
conditions, for Your brain plans how to do so. You live everywhere as Paramatma; therefore You are
known as Vasudeva. You also accept Vasudeva as Your father, and You are celebrated by the name Krsna.
You are so kind that You always increase the influence of all kinds of devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verse it has been said (grhita-maya-guna-vigrahaya) that the Lord accepts three kinds of
bodies (Visnu, Brahma and Siva) for the purposes of creating, maintaining and annihilating the cosmic
manifestation. The three predominating deities of the material universe (Brahma, Visnu and Siva) are
called guna-avataras. There are many kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
the first incarnations within this material world are Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Siva). Out of these
three, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva accept material bodies, but Lord Visnu does not accept a material body.
Lord Visnu is therefore known as visuddha-sattva. His existence is completely free from the
contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Visnu is in the
same category with Lord Brahma and Siva. The sastras forbid us to think in this way.
yas tu narayanam devam
brahma-rudradi-daivataih
samatvenaiva vikseta
sa pasandi bhaved dhruvam
One who considers Lord Visnu to be in the same category with devas like Lord Brahma or Lord Siva or
who thinks Lord Brahma and Siva to be equal to Lord Visnu is to be considered as pasandi (a faithless
nonbeliever). Therefore in this verse Lord Visnu is distinguished in the words namo visuddha-sattvaya.
Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahma is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given
the high post of Brahma. Lord Siva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
and Brahma, the living entity. Lord Siva is therefore explained in Brahma-samhita (5.45) in this way:
ksiram yatha dadhi vikara-visesa-yogat
sanjayate na hi tatah prthag asti hetoh
yah sambhutam api tatha samupaiti karyad
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Lord Siva is considered to be like yogurt (dadhi). Yogurt is nothing but transformed milk; nonetheless,
yogurt cannot be accepted as milk. Similarly, Lord Siva holds almost all the powers of Lord Visnu, and he
is also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like Visnu, just as yogurt, although
transformed milk, is not exactly like milk.
The Supreme personality of Godhead is also described herein as vasudevaya krsnaya. Krsna is the
original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all Visnu expansions are His plenary portions or portions
of His plenary portions (known as svamsa and kala). The svamsa, or direct expansion, is also called amsa.
All visnu-tattvas are svamsa, direct parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. Krsna
is known as Vasudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of Vasudeva. Similarly, He is
known as Devaki-nandana, Yasoda-nandana, Nanda-nandana and so on.
Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the influence of His devotees. Therefore
He is described herein as prabhave sarva-satvatam. The satvata community is a community of Vaisnavas,
pure devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited powers, and He wants to
see that His devotees are also entrusted with unlimited powers. A devotee of the Lord is always, therefore,
distinguished from all other living entities.
The word hari means "one who takes away all miserable conditions," and hari-medhase means that the
Lord is always planning ways to deliver the conditioned soul from the clutches of maya. The Lord is so
kind that He personally incarnates to deliver the conditioned souls, and whenever He comes, He makes
His plans.
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
"To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion,
I advent Myself millennium after millennium." (Bg. 4.8)
Since the Lord delivers all conditioned souls from the clutches of maya, He is known as hari-medhas. In
the list of incarnations, Krsna is described as the supreme and original Personality of Godhead.
ete camsa-kalah pumsah
krsnas tu bhagavan svayam
indrari-vyakulam lokam
mrdayanti yuge yuge
(Bhag. 1.3.28)
Krsna, the original Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world when the demigods, who are
devotees of the Lord, are disturbed by the demons.
