<h2>Text</h2>
prasthanabhimukho 'py enam
anugraha-vilambitah
pasyan padma-palasakso
na pratasthe suhrt satam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prasthana--to leave; abhimukhah--ready; api--although; enam--him (Prthu); anugraha--by kindness;
vilambitah--detained; pasyan--seeing; padma-palasa-aksah--the Lord, whose eyes are like the petals of a
lotus flower; na--not; pratasthe--departed; suhrt--the well-wisher; satam--of the devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord was just about to leave, but because He was so greatly inclined toward the behavior of King
Prthu, He did not depart. Seeing the behavior of Maharaja Prthu with His lotus eyes, He was detained
because He is always the well-wisher of His devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the words suhrt satam are very significant. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is always very
inclined toward His devotee and is always thinking of the devotee's well-being. This is not partiality. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord is equal to everyone (samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu), but to one who
particularly engages in His service, He is very much inclined. In another place, the Lord says that a
devotee always exists in His heart, and He also exists always in the heart of the devotee.
The special inclination of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for His pure devotee is not unnatural,
nor is it partiality. For example, sometimes a father has several children, but he has special affection for
one child who is very much inclined toward him. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
Those who constantly engage in the devotional service of the Lord in love and affection are directly in
contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead sitting as the Supersoul in everyone's heart. The Lord is
not far away from the devotee. He is always in everyone's heart, but only the devotee can realize the Lord's
presence, and thus he is directly connected, and he takes instruction from the Lord at every moment.
Therefore, there is no chance of a devotee's being in error, nor is there any partiality on the part of the
Lord for His pure devotees.
