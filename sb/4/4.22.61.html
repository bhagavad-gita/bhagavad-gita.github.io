<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You have manifold energies, and these energies are manifested in manifold forms. With
such energies You have also created this cosmic manifestation, and although You maintain it as if it were
permanent, You ultimately annihilate it. Although You are never disturbed by such changes and
alterations, the living entities are disturbed by them, and therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to
be different or separated from You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is clearly explained that Lord Krsna has multienergies, which can be grouped into three: namely the
external energy, the internal energy and the marginal energy. There are also different cosmic
manifestations--namely the spiritual world and the material world--as well as different types of living
entities. Some living entities are conditioned, and others are eternally free. The eternally free living
entities are called nitya-mukta, for they never come in contact with the material energy. However, some
living entities are conditioned in this material world, and thus they think themselves separated from the
Supreme Lord. Due to their contact with the material energy, their existence is always troublesome. Being
always in distress, the conditioned soul considers the material energy to be very much disturbing. This
fact is explained by a Vaisnava kavi, or poet:
krsna bhuli' sei jiva anadi-bahirmukha
ataeva maya tare deya samsara-duhkha
When the living entity forgets the Supreme Lord and wants to enjoy himself independently, imitating
the Supreme Lord, he is captured by the false notion that he is the enjoyer and is separated from the
Supreme Lord. This material energy is therefore very much troublesome to the spiritual energy, the living
entity, but the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. Indeed, for the Supreme Lord,
both material and spiritual energy are the same. In this verse Lord Siva explains that the material energy is
never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always independent, but because the living
entities are not independent--due to their false idea of becoming independently happy--the material
energy is troublesome. Consequently the material energy creates differentiation.
Because the Mayavadi philosophers cannot understand this, they want to be relieved from the material
energy. However, because a Vaisnava philosopher is in full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he finds no disturbance even in the material energy. This is because he knows how to utilize the
material energy for the service of the Lord. In the government, the criminal department and civil
department may appear different in the eyes of the citizens, but in the eyes of the government both
departments are one and the same. The criminal department is troublesome for the criminal but not for
the obedient citizen. Similarly, this material energy is troublesome for the conditioned soul, but it has
nothing to do with the liberated souls who are engaged in the service of the Lord. Through the purusaavatara
Maha-Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead created the whole cosmic manifestation. Simply
by breathing out all the universes, the Lord creates and maintains the cosmic manifestation as Lord Visnu.
Then as Sankarsana, He annihilates the cosmic manifestation. Yet despite the creation, maintenance and
destruction of the cosmos, the Lord is not affected. The various activities of the Lord must be very
disturbing to the tiny living entities, but since the Lord is supremely great, He is never affected. Lord Siva
or any other pure devotee can see this clearly without being blinded by bheda-buddhi, or differentiation.
For a devotee, the Lord is the supreme spirit soul. Since He is supremely powerful, His various powers are
also spiritual. For a devotee, there is nothing material, for material existence only means forgetfulness of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
