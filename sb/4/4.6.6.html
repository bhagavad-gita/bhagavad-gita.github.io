<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya said: My dear Vidura, all the personalities present were very much satisfied in
heart and soul upon hearing the words of Lord Siva, who is the best among the benedictors.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse Lord Siva is described as midhustama, the best of the benedictors. He is also known as
Asutosa, which indicates that he is very quickly satisfied and very quickly angered. It is said in Bhagavadgita
that less intelligent persons go to the demigods for material benedictions. In this connection, people
generally go to Lord Siva, and because he is always quickly satisfied and gives benedictions to his devotees
without consideration, he is called midhustama, or the best of the benedictors. Materialistic persons are
always anxious to get material profit, but they are not serious about spiritual profit.
Sometimes, of course, it so happens that Lord Siva becomes the best benedictor in spiritual life. It is said
that once a poor brahmana worshiped Lord Siva for a benediction, and Lord Siva advised the devotee to
go to see Sanatana Gosvami. The devotee went to Sanatana Gosvami and informed him that Lord Siva had
advised him to seek out the best benediction from him (Sanatana). Sanatana had a touchstone with him,
which he kept with the garbage. On the request of the poor brahmana, Sanatana Gosvami gave him the
touchstone, and the brahmana was very happy to have it. He now could get as much gold as he desired
simply by touching the touchstone to iron. But after he left Sanatana, he thought, "If a touchstone is the
best benediction, why has Sanatana Gosvami kept it with the garbage?" He therefore returned and asked
Sanatana Gosvami, "Sir, if this is the best benediction, why did you keep it with the garbage?" Sanatana
Gosvami then informed him, "Actually, this is not the best benediction. But are you prepared to take the
best benediction from me?" The brahmana said, "Yes, sir. Lord Siva has sent me to you for the best
benediction." Then Sanatana Gosvami asked him to throw the touchstone in the water nearby and then
come back. The poor brahmana did so, and when he returned, Sanatana Gosvami initiated him with the
Hare Krsna mantra. Thus by the benediction of Lord Siva the brahmana got the association of the best
devotee of Lord Krsna and was thus initiated in the maha-mantra, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna,
Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
