<h2>Text</h2>
sankarsanaya suksmaya
durantayantakaya ca
namo visva-prabodhaya
pradyumnayantar-atmane
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sankarsanaya--unto the master of integration; suksmaya--unto the subtle unmanifested material
ingredients; durantaya--unto the unsurpassable; antakaya--unto the master of disintegration; ca--also;
namah--obeisances; visva-prabodhaya--unto the master of the development of the universe;
pradyumnaya--unto Lord Pradyumna; antah-atmane--unto the Supersoul in everyone's heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are the origin of the subtle material ingredients, the master of all integration as well
as the master of all disintegration, the predominating Deity named Sankarsana, and the master of all
intelligence, known as the predominating Deity Pradyumna. Therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances
unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole universe is maintained by the integrating power of the Supreme Lord, who is known in that
capacity by the name Sankarsana. The material scientists may have discovered the law of gravity, which
maintains the integration of objects within the material energy, yet the master of all integration can create
devastation by the disintegrating blazing fire emanating from His mouth. A description of this can be
found in the Eleventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, wherein the universal form of the Lord is described. The
master of integration is also the destroyer of this world by virtue of His disintegrating energy. Sankarsana
is the master of integration and disintegration, whereas Pradyumna, another feature of Lord Vasudeva, is
responsible for universal growth and maintenance. The word suksmaya is significant because within this
gross material body there are subtle material bodies--namely mind, intelligence and ego. The Lord in His
different features (Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Sankarsana) maintains both the gross and subtle
material elements of this world. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gita, the gross material elements are earth,
water, fire, air and ether, and the subtle material elements are mind, intelligence and ego. All of them are
controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha,
and this will be further explained in the following verse.
