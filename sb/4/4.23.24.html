<h2>Text</h2>
tasmin dadhe damam aham tava vira-patni
yo 'nyatra bhusura-kulat krta-kilbisas tam
pasye na vita-bhayam unmuditam tri-lokyam
anyatra vai mura-ripor itaratra dasat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmin--unto him; dadhe--shall give; damam--punishment; aham--I; tava--to you; vira-patni--O wife of
the hero; yah--one who; anyatra--besides; bhu-sura-kulat--from the group of demigods on this earth (the
brahmanas); krta--done; kilbisah--offense; tam--him; pasye--I see; na--not; vita--without; bhayam--fear;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O hero's wife, kindly tell me if someone has offended you. I am prepared to give such a person
punishment as long as he does not belong to the brahmana caste. But for the servant of Muraripu [Krsna],
I excuse no one within or beyond these three worlds. No one can freely move after offending you, for I am
prepared to punish him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic civilization, a brahmana, or one who is properly qualified to understand the
Absolute Truth--that is, one belonging to the most intelligent social order--as well as the devotee of Lord
Krsna, who is known as Muradvisa, enemy of a demon named Mura, is not subject to the rules and
regulations of the state. In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by
the government except the brahmanas and Vaisnavas. Brahmanas and Vaisnavas never transgress the laws
of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such
law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by
the king. This instruction was given to King Pracinabarhisat by Narada Muni. King Puranjana was a
representative of King Pracinabarhisat, and Narada Muni was reminding King Pracinabarhisat of his
forefather, Maharaja Prthu, who never chastised a brahmana or a Vaisnava.
One's pure intelligence, or pure Krsna consciousness, becomes polluted by material activities. Pure
consciousness can be revived by the process of sacrifice, charity, pious activities, etc., but when one
pollutes his Krsna consciousness by offending a brahmana or a Vaisnava, it is very difficult to revive. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has described the vaisnava-aparadha, or offense to a Vaisnava, as "the mad elephant
offense." One should be very careful not to offend a Vaisnava or a brahmana. Even the great yogi Durvasa
was harassed by the Sudarsana cakra when he offended the Vaisnava Maharaja Ambarisa, who was neither
a brahmana nor a sannyasi but an ordinary householder. Maharaja Ambarisa was a Vaisnava, and
consequently Durvasa Muni was chastised.
The conclusion is that if Krsna consciousness is covered by material sins, one can eliminate the sins
simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, but if one pollutes his Krsna consciousness by offending a
brahmana or a Vaisnava, one cannot revive it until one properly atones for the sin by pleasing the
offended Vaisnava or brahmana. This was the course that Durvasa Muni had to follow, for he surrendered
unto Maharaja Ambarisa. A vaisnava-aparadha cannot be atoned for by any means other than by begging
the pardon of the offended Vaisnava.
