<h2>Translation</h2>
Another son of Lord Brahma was Irreligion, whose wife's name was Falsity. From their combination
were born two demons named Dambha, or Bluffing, and Maya, or Cheating. These two demons were
taken by a demon named Nirrti, who had no children.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood herein that Adharma, Irreligion, was also a son of Brahma, and he married his sister
Mrsa. This is the beginning of sex life between brother and sister. This unnatural combination of sex life
can be possible in human society only where there is Adharma, or Irreligion. It is understood that in the
beginning of creation Brahma created not only saintly sons like Sanaka, Sanatana and Narada but also
demonic offspring like Nirrti, Adharma, Dambha and Falsity. Everything was created by Brahma in the
beginning. Regarding Narada, it is understood that because his previous life was very pious and his
association very good, he was born as Narada. Others were also born in their own capacities, according to
their backgrounds. The law of karma continues birth after birth, and when there is a new creation, the
same karma comes back with the living entities. They are born in different capacities according to karma
even though their father is originally Brahma, who is the exalted qualitative incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
