rajovaca
krto me 'nugrahah purvam
harinartanukampina
tam apadayitum brahman
bhagavan yuyam agatah
SYNONYMS
raja uvaca--the King said; krtah--done; me--unto me; anugrahah--causeless mercy; purvam--formerly;
harina--by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu; arta-anukampina--compassionate for
persons in distress; tam--that; apadayitum--to confirm it; brahman--O brahmana; bhagavan--O powerful
one; yuyam--all of you; agatah--have arrived here.
TRANSLATION
The King said: O brahmana, O powerful one, formerly Lord Visnu showed me His causeless mercy,
indicating that you would come to my house, and to confirm that blessing, you have all come.
PURPORT
When Lord Visnu appeared in the great arena of sacrifice at the time when King Prthu was performing a
great sacrifice (asvamedha), He predicted that the Kumaras would very soon come and advise the King.
Therefore Prthu Maharaja remembered the causeless mercy of the Lord and thus welcomed the arrival of
the Kumaras, who were fulfilling the Lord's prediction. In other words, when the Lord makes a
prediction, He fulfills that prediction through some of His devotees. Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
predicted that both His glorious names and the Hare Krsna maha-mantra would be broadcast in all the
towns and villages of the world. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Prabhupada desired to fulfill this great prediction, and we are following in their footsteps.
Regarding His devotees, Lord Krsna told Arjuna, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son
of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee will never perish." (Bg. 9.31) The point is that the Lord
Himself could declare such things, but it was His desire to make the declaration through Arjuna and thus
doubly assure that His promise would never be broken. The Lord Himself promises, and His confidential
devotees execute the promise. The Lord makes so many promises for the benefit of suffering humanity.
Although the Lord is very compassionate upon suffering humanity, human beings are generally not very
anxious to serve Him. The relationship is something like that between the father and the son; the father is
always anxious for the welfare of the son, even though the son forgets or neglects the father. The word
anukampina is significant; the Lord is so compassionate upon the living entities that He comes Himself
into this world in order to benefit fallen souls.
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." (Bg. 4.7)
Thus it is out of compassion that the Lord appears in His different forms. Lord Sri Krsna appeared on
this planet out of compassion for fallen souls; Lord Buddha appeared out of compassion for the poor
animals who were being killed by the demons; Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared out of compassion for
Prahlada Maharaja. The conclusion is that the Lord is so compassionate upon the fallen souls within this
material world that He comes Himself or sends His devotees and His servants to fulfill His desire to have
all the fallen souls come back home, back to Godhead. Thus Lord Sri Krsna instructed Bhagavad-gita to
Arjuna for the benefit of the entire human society. Intelligent men should therefore seriously consider this
Krsna consciousness movement and fully utilize the instructions of Bhagavad-gita as preached without
adulteration by His pure devotees.
