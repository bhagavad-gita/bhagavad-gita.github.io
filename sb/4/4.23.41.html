<h2>Text</h2>
ka nama vira vikhyatam
vadanyam priya-darsanam
na vrnita priyam praptam
madrsi tvadrsam patim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ka--who; nama--indeed; vira--my dear hero; vikhyatam--famous; vadanyam--magnanimous; priyadarsanam--
beautiful; na--not; vrnita--would accept; priyam--easily; praptam--gotten; madrsi--like me;
tvadrsam--like you; patim--husband.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my dear hero, who in this world will not accept a husband like you? You are so famous, so
magnanimous, so beautiful and so easily gotten.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every husband is certainly a great hero to his wife. In other words, if a woman loves a man, that man
appears very beautiful and magnanimous. Unless one becomes beautiful in the eyes of another, one
cannot dedicate his whole life to another. The husband is considered very magnanimous because he gives
as many children to the wife as she likes. Every woman is fond of children; therefore any husband who
can please his wife by sex and give her children is considered very magnanimous. Not only does the
husband become magnanimous by begetting children, but by giving his wife ornaments, nice food and
dresses, he keeps her completely under submission. Such a satisfied wife will never give up the company
of her husband. Manu-samhita recommends that to keep a wife satisfied a husband should give her some
ornaments because women are generally fond of home, ornaments, dresses, children, etc. In this way the
woman is the center of all material enjoyment.
In this regard, the word vikhyatam is very significant. A man is always famous for his aggression toward
a beautiful woman, and such aggression is sometimes considered rape. Although rape is not legally
allowed, it is a fact that a woman likes a man who is very expert at rape.
