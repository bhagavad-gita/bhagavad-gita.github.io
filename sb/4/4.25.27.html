<h2>Translation</h2>
Due to his contaminated association with women, a living entity like King Puranjana eternally suffers all
the pangs of material existence and remains in the dark region of material life, bereft of all remembrance
for many, many years.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is a description of material existence. Material existence is experienced when one becomes attached
to a woman and forgets his real identity as the eternal servant of Krsna (nasta-smrtih). In this way, in one
body after another, the living entity perpetually suffers the threefold miseries of material existence. To
save human civilization from the darkness of ignorance, this movement was started. The main purpose of
the Krsna consciousness movement is to enlighten the forgetful living entity and remind him of his
original Krsna consciousness. In this way the living entity can be saved from the catastrophe of ignorance
as well as bodily transmigration. As Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung:
anadi karama-phale, padi' bhavarnava-jale,
taribare na dekhi upaya
ei visaya-halahale, diva-nisi hiya jvale,
mana kabhu sukha nahi paya
"Because of my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen into an ocean of nescience. I cannot find any
means to get out of this great ocean, which is indeed like an ocean of poison. We are trying to be happy
through sense enjoyment, but actually that so-called enjoyment is like food that is too hot and causes
burning in the heart. I feel a burning sensation constantly, day and night, and thus my mind cannot find
satisfaction."
Material existence is always full of anxiety. People are always trying to find many ways to mitigate
anxiety, but because they are not guided by a real leader, they try to forget material anxiety through drink
and sex indulgence. Foolish people do not know that by attempting to escape anxiety by drink and sex,
they simply increase their duration of material life. It is not possible to escape material anxiety in this
way.
The word pramada-sanga-dusitah indicates that apart from all other contamination, if one simply
remains attached to a woman, that single contamination will be sufficient to prolong one's miserable
material existence. Consequently, in Vedic civilization one is trained from the beginning to give up
attachment for women. The first stage of life is brahmacari, the second stage grhastha, the third stage
vanaprastha, and the fourth stage sannyasa. All these stages are devised to enable one to detach himself
from the association of women.
