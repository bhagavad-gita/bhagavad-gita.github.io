<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the ancient, eternal Godhead, who is foremost amongst all great
personalities, obtained the opulence of His staunch reputation, which purifies the entire universe, by
worshiping the lotus feet of those brahmanas and Vaisnavas.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Person is described herein as brahmanya-deva. Brahmanya refers to the brahmanas, the
Vaisnavas or the brahminical culture, and deva means "worshipable Lord." Therefore unless one is on the
transcendental platform of being a Vaisnava or on the highest platform of material goodness (as a
brahmana), he cannot appreciate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the lower stages of ignorance
and passion, it is difficult to appreciate or understand the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Lord is described
herein as the worshipable Deity for persons in brahminical and Vaisnava culture.
namo brahmanya-devaya
go-brahmana-hitaya ca
jagad-dhitaya krsnaya
govindaya namo namah
(Visnu Purana 1.19.65)
Lord Krsna, the Supreme personality of Godhead, is the prime protector of brahminical culture and the
cow. Without knowing and respecting these, one cannot realize the science of God, and without this
knowledge, any welfare activities or humanitarian propaganda cannot be successful. The Lord is purusa,
or the supreme enjoyer. Not only is He the enjoyer when He appears as a manifested incarnation, but He
is the enjoyer since time immemorial, from the very beginning (puratanah), and eternally (nityam). Yaccaranabhivandanat:
Prthu Maharaja said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead attained this opulence
of eternal fame simply by worshiping the lotus feet of the brahmanas. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that
the Lord does not need to work to achieve material gain. Since He is perpetually supremely perfect, He
does not need to obtain anything, but still it is said that He obtained His opulences by worshiping the
lotus feet of the brahmanas. These are His exemplary actions. When Lord Sri Krsna was in Dvaraka, He
offered His respects by bowing down at the lotus feet of Narada. When Sudama Vipra came to His house,
Lord Krsna personally washed his feet and gave him a seat on His personal bed. Although He is the
Supreme personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna offered His respects to Maharaja Yudhisthira and Kunti.
The Lord's exemplary behavior is to teach us. We should learn from His personal behavior how to give
protection to the cow, how to cultivate brahminical qualities and how to respect the brahmanas and the
Vaisnavas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (3.21), yad yad acarati sresthas tat tad evetaro janah: "If the
leading personalities behave in a certain manner, others follow them automatically." Who can be more of
a leading personality than the Supreme personality of Godhead, and whose behavior could be more
exemplary? It is not that He needed to do all these things to acquire material gain, but all of these acts
were performed just to teach us how to behave in this material world.
The Supreme personality of Godhead is described herein as mahattama-agranih. Within this material
world, the mahattamas, or great personalities, are Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, but He is above them all.
Narayanah paro'vyaktat: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in a transcendental position, above
everything created within this material world. His opulence, His riches, His beauty, His wisdom, His
knowledge, His renunciation and His reputation are all jagat-pavitram, universally purifying. The more we
discuss His opulences, the more the universe becomes purer and purer. In the material world, the
opulences possessed by a material person are never fixed. Today one may be a very rich man, but
tomorrow he may become poor; today one is very famous, but tomorrow he may be infamous. Materially
obtained opulences are never fixed, but all six opulences perpetually exist in the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, not only in the spiritual world, but also in this material world. Lord Krsna's reputation is fixed,
and His book of wisdom, Bhagavad-gita, is still honored. Everything pertaining to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is eternally existing.
