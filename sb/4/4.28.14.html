<h2>Text</h2>
yatha taror mula-nisecanena
trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah
pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam
tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as; taroh--of a tree; mula--the root; nisecanena--by watering; trpyanti--are satisfied; tat--its;
skandha--trunk; bhuja--branches; upasakhah--and twigs; prana--the life air; upaharat--by feeding; ca--and;
yatha--as; indriyanam--of the senses; tatha eva--similarly; sarva--of all demigods; arhanam--worship;
acyuta--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ijya--worship.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches, twigs and everything else, and as
supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, simply worshiping the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods, who are parts of
that Supreme Personality.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes people ask why this Krsna consciousness movement simply advocates worship of Krsna to
the exclusion of the demigods. The answer is given in this verse. The example of pouring water on the
root of a tree is very appropriate. In Bhagavad-gita (15.1) it is said, urdhva-mulam adhah-sakham: this
cosmic manifestation has expanded downward, and the root is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As
the Lord confirms in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am the source of all spiritual and
material worlds." Krsna is the root of everything; therefore rendering service to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Krsna (krsna-seva), means automatically serving all the demigods. Sometimes it is argued
that karma and jnana require a mixture of bhakti in order to be successfully executed, and sometimes it is
argued that bhakti also requires karma and jnana for its successful termination. The fact is, however, that
although karma and jnana cannot be successful without bhakti, bhakti does not require the help of karma
and jnana. Actually, as described by Srila Rupa Gosvami, anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam:
pure devotional service should not be contaminated by the touch of karma and jnana. Modern society is
involved in various types of philanthropic works, humanitarian works and so on, but people do not know
that these activities will never be successful unless Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is brought
into the center. One may ask what harm there is in worshiping Krsna and the different parts of His body,
the demigods, and the answer is also given in this verse. The point is that by supplying food to the
stomach, the indriyas, the senses, are automatically satisfied. If one tries to feed his eyes or ears
independently, the result is only havoc. Simply by supplying food to the stomach, we satisfy all of the
senses. It is neither necessary nor feasible to render separate service to the individual senses. The
conclusion is that by serving Krsna (krsna-seva), everything is complete. As confirmed in Caitanyacaritamrta
(Madhya 22.62), krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta haya: if one is engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is automatically accomplished.
