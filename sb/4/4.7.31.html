<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma said: My dear Lord, Your personality and eternal form cannot be understood by any
person who is trying to know You through the different processes of acquiring knowledge. Your position
is always transcendental to the material creation, whereas the empiric attempt to understand You is
material, as are its objectives and instruments.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that the transcendental name, qualities, activities, paraphernalia, etc., of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead cannot be understood with our material senses. The attempt of the empiric
philosophers to understand the Absolute Truth by speculation is always futile because their process of
understanding, their objective and the instruments by which they try to understand the Absolute Truth
are all material. The Lord is aprakrta, beyond the creation of the material world. This fact is also accepted
by the great impersonalist Sankaracarya: narayanah paro 'vyaktad andam avyakta-sambhavam. Avyakta, or
the original material cause, is beyond this material manifestation and is the cause of the material world.
Because Narayana, the Supreme personality of Godhead, is beyond the material world, one cannot
speculate upon Him by any material method. One has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead
simply by the transcendental method of Krsna consciousness. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.55).
Bhaktya mam abhijanati: only by devotional service can one understand the transcendental form of the
Lord. The difference between the impersonalists and the personalists is that the impersonalists, limited by
their speculative processes, cannot even approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the
devotees please the Supreme personality of Godhead through His transcendental loving service.
Sevonmukhe hi: due to the service attitude of the devotee, the Lord is revealed to him. The Supreme Lord
cannot be understood by materialistic persons even though He is present before them. In Bhagavad-gita,
Lord Krsna therefore condemns such materialists as mudhas. Mudha means "rascal." It is said in the Gita,
"Only rascals think of Lord Krsna as an ordinary person. They do not know what Lord Krsna's position is
or what His transcendental potencies are." Unaware of His transcendental potencies, the impersonalists
deride the person of Lord Krsna, whereas the devotees, by dint of their service attitude, can understand
Him as the Personality of Godhead. In the Tenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, Arjuna also confirmed that it
is very difficult to understand the personality of the Lord.
