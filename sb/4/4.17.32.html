<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prak--before; prthoh--King Prthu; iha--on this planet; na--never; eva--certainly; esa--this; pura--of

<h2>Translation</h2>
Before the reign of King Prthu there was no planned arrangement for different cities, villages, pasturing
grounds, etc. Every thing was scattered, and everyone constructed his residential quarters according to his
own convenience. However, since King Prthu plans were made for towns and villages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this statement it appears that town and city planning is not new but has been coming down since
the time of King Prthu. In India we can see regular planning methods evident in very old cities. In Srimad-
Bhagavatam there are many descriptions of such ancient cities. Even five thousand years ago, Lord Krsna's
capital, Dvaraka, was well planned, and similar other cities--Mathura and Hastinapura (now New Delhi)--
were also well planned. Thus the planning of cities and towns is not a modern innovation but was existing
in bygone ages.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Prthu Maharaja Milks the Earth Planet."
