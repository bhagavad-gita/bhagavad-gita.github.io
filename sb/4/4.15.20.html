<h2>Text</h2>
ayam bhuvo mandalam odayadrer
goptaika-viro naradeva-nathah
asthaya jaitram ratham atta-capah
paryasyate daksinato yatharkah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ayam--this King; bhuvah--of the world; mandalam--the globe; a-udaya-adreh--from the mountain where
the first appearance of the sun is visible; gopta--will protect; eka--uniquely; virah--powerful, heroic; naradeva--
of all kings, gods in human society; nathah--the master; asthaya--being situated on; jaitram--
victorious; ratham--his chariot; atta-capah--holding the bow; paryasyate--he will circumambulate;
daksinatah--from the southern side; yatha--like; arkah--the sun.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This King, being uniquely powerful and heroic, will have no competitor. He will travel around the globe
on his victorious chariot, holding his invincible bow in his hand and appearing exactly like the sun,
which rotates in its own orbit from the south.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word yatharkah indicates that the sun is not fixed but is rotating in its orbit, which is
set by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita and also in other
parts of Srimad-Bhagavatam. In the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that the sun rotates in
its own orbit at the rate of sixteen thousand miles per second. Similarly, Brahma-samhita states,
yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakrah: the sun rotates in its own orbit according to the order of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that the sun is not fixed in one place. As far as Prthu
Maharaja is concerned, it is indicated that his ruling power would extend all over the world. The
Himalaya Mountains, from which the sunrise is first seen, are called udayacala or udayadri. It is herein
indicated that Prthu Maharaja's reign over the world would cover even the Himalaya Mountains and
extend to the borders of all oceans and seas. In other words, his reign would cover the entire planet.
Another significant word in this verse is naradeva. As described in previous verses, the qualified king--
be he King Prthu or any other king who rules over the state as an ideal king--should be understood to be
God in human form. According to Vedic culture, the king is honored as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead because he represents Narayana, who also gives protection to the citizens. He is therefore natha,
or the proprietor. Even Sanatana Gosvami gave respect to the Nawab Hussain Shah as naradeva, although
the Nawab was Muhammadan. A king or governmental head must therefore be so competent to rule over
the state that the citizens will worship him as God in human form. That is the perfectional stage for the
head of any government or state.
