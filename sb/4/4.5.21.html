<h2>Text</h2>
pusno hy apatayad dantan
kalingasya yatha balah
sapyamane garimani
yo 'hasad darsayan datah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pusnah--of Pusa; hi--since; apatayat--extracted; dantan--the teeth; kalingasya--of the King of Kalinga;
yatha--as; balah--Baladeva; sapyamane--while being cursed; garimani--Lord Siva; yah--who (Pusa);
ahasat--smiled; darsayan--showing; datah--his teeth.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as Baladeva knocked out the teeth of Dantavakra, the King of Kalinga, during the gambling match
at the marriage ceremony of Aniruddha, Virabhadra knocked out the teeth of both Daksa, who had shown
them while cursing Lord Siva, and Pusa, who by smiling sympathetically had also shown his teeth.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mere a reference is made to the marriage of Aniruddha, a grandson of Lord Krsna's. He kidnapped the
daughter of Dantavakra, and thereafter he was arrested. Just as he was to be punished for the kidnapping,
the soldiers from Dvaraka arrived, headed by Balarama, and a fight ensued amongst the ksatriyas. This
sort of fight was very common, especially during marriage ceremonies, when everyone was in a
challenging spirit. In that challenging spirit, a fight was sure to occur, and in such fights there was
commonly killing and misfortune. After finishing such fighting, the parties would come to a compromise,
and everything would be settled. This Daksa yajna was similar to such events. Now all of them--Daksa and
the demigods Bhaga and Pusa and Bhrgu Muni--were punished by the soldiers of Lord Siva, but later
everything would come to a peaceful end. So this spirit of fighting between one another was not exactly
inimical. Because everyone was so powerful and wanted to show his strength by Vedic mantra or mystic
power, all these fighting skills were very elaborately exhibited by the different parties at the Daksa yajna.
