<h2>Translation</h2>
I think that all my sisters must have gone to this great sacrificial ceremony with their husbands just to
see their relatives. I also desire to decorate myself with the ornaments given to me by my father and go
there with you to participate in that assemble.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is a woman's nature to want to decorate herself with ornaments and nice dresses and accompany her
husband to social functions, meet friends and relatives, and enjoy life in that way. This propensity is not
unusual, for woman is the basic principle of material enjoyment. Therefore in Sanskrit the word for
woman is stri, which means "one who expands the field of material enjoyment." In the material world
there is an attraction between woman and man. This is the arrangement of conditional life. A woman
attracts a man, and in that way the scope of material activities, involving house, wealth, children and
friendship, increases, and thus instead of decreasing one's material demands, one becomes entangled in
material enjoyment. Lord Siva, however, is different; therefore his name is Siva. He is not at all attracted
by material enjoyment, although his wife, Sati, was the daughter of a very great leader and was given to
him by the request of Brahma. Lord Siva was reluctant, but Sati, as a woman, the daughter of a king,
wanted enjoyment. She wanted to go to her father's house, just as her other sisters might have done, and
meet them and enjoy social life. Here, she specifically indicated that she would decorate herself with the
ornaments given by her father. She did not say that she would decorate herself with the ornaments given
by her husband because her husband was callous about all such matters. He did not know how to
decorate his wife and take part in social life because he was always in ecstasy with thoughts of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to the Vedic system, a daughter is given a sufficient dowry at
the time of her marriage, and therefore Sati was also given a dowry by her father, and ornaments were
included. It is also the custom that the husband gives some ornaments, but here it is particularly
mentioned that her husband, being materially almost nothing, could not do so; therefore she wanted to
decorate herself with the ornaments given by her father. It was fortunate for Sati that Lord Siva did not
take the ornaments from his wife and spend them for ganja, because those who imitate Lord Siva in
smoking ganja exploit everything from household affairs; they take all of their wives' property and spend
on smoking, intoxication and similar other activities.
