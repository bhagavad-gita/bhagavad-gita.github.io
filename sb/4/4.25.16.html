<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana then began to think of his daughters, sons, grandsons, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law,
servants and other associates as well as his house, his household paraphernalia and his little accumulation
of wealth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is not infrequent for a person overly attached to the material body to request a physician to prolong
his life at least for some time. If the so-called scientific physician is able to prolong one's life for a few
minutes through the use of oxygen or other medicines, he thinks that he is very successful in his
attempts, although ultimately the patient will die. This is called the struggle for existence. At the time of
death both patient and physician still think of prolonging life, although all the constituents of the body
are practically dead and gone.
