<h2>Text</h2>
uvaca ca maha-bhagam
dharma-jnapanna-vatsala
trahi mam api bhutanam
palane 'vasthito bhavan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
uvaca--she said; ca--and; maha-bhagam--unto the great, fortunate King; dharma-jna--O knower of the
principles of religion; apanna-vatsala--O shelter of the surrendered; trahi--save; mam--me; api--indeed;
bhutanam--of living entities; palane--in protection; avasthitah--situated; bhavan--Your Majesty.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Addressing the great, opulent King Prthu as the knower of religious principles and shelter of the
surrendered, she said: Please save me. You are the protector of all living entities. Now you are situated as
the King of this planet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The cow-shaped earth addressed King Prthu as dharma jna, which refers to one who knows the
principles of religion. The principles of religion dictate that a woman, a cow, a child, a brahmana and an
old man must be given all protection by the king or anyone else. Consequently mother earth took the
shape of a cow. She was also a woman. Thus she appealed to the King as one who knows the principles of
religion. Religious principles also dictate that one is not to be killed if he surrenders. She reminded King
Prthu that not only was he an incarnation of God, but he was situated as the King of the earth as well.
Therefore his duty was to excuse her.
