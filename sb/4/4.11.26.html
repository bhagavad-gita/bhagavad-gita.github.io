<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear King Dhruva, neither your forefathers nor anyone else before you ever achieved such a
transcendental planet. The planet known as Visnuloka, where Lord Visnu personally resides, is the
highest of all. It is worshipable by the inhabitants of all other planets within the universe. Please come
with us and live there eternally.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja went to perform austerities, he was very determined to achieve a post never
dreamed of by his forefathers. His father was Uttanapada, his grandfather was Manu, and his greatgrandfather
was Lord Brahma. So Dhruva wanted a kingdom even greater than Lord Brahma could
achieve, and he requested Narada Muni to give him facility for achieving it. The associates of Lord Visnu
reminded him that not only his forefathers but everyone else before him was unable to attain Visnuloka,
the planet where Lord Visnu resides. This is because everyone within this material world is either a karmi,
a jnani or a yogi, but there are hardly any pure devotees. The transcendental planet known as Visnuloka is
especially meant for devotees, not for karmis, jnanis or yogis. Great rsis or demigods can hardly approach
Brahmaloka, and as stated in Bhagavad-gita, Brahmaloka is not a permanent residence. Lord Brahma's
duration of life is so long that it is difficult to estimate even the duration of one day in his life, and yet
Lord Brahma also dies, as do the residents of his planet. Bhagavad-gita (8.16) says, abrahma-bhuvanal
lokah punar avartino 'rjuna: except for those who go to Visnuloka, everyone is subjected to the four
principles of material life, namely birth, death, old age and disease. The Lord says, yad gatva na nivartante
tad dhama paramam mama: "The planet from which, once going, no one returns, is My supreme abode."
(Bg. 15.6) Dhruva Maharaja was reminded, "You are going in our company to that planet from which no
one returns to this material world." Material scientists are attempting to go to the moon and other planets,
but they cannot imagine going to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, for it is beyond their imagination. By
material calculation, traveling at the speed of light it would take forty thousand light-years to reach the
topmost planet. By mechanical processes we are unable to reach the topmost planet of this universe, but
the process called bhakti-yoga, as executed by Maharaja Dhruva, can give one the facility not only to
reach other planets within this universe, but also to reach beyond this universe to the Visnuloka planets.
We have outlined this in our small booklet Easy Journey to Other Planets.
