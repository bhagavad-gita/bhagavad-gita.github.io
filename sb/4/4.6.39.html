<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jagat--the material world; udbhava--creation; sthiti--maintenance; layesu--in annihilation; daivatah--
destiny; bahu--many; bhidyamana--being variegated; gunaya--by material qualities; atma-mayaya--by His
material energy; racita--produced; atma--in the living entities; bheda-mataye--who produced different
inclinations; sva-samsthaya--by His internal potency; vinivartita--caused to stop; bhrama--interaction;
guna--of material modes; atmane--unto Him in His personal form; namah--obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who has created varieties of manifestations and
put them under the spell of the three qualities of the material world in order to create, maintain and
annihilate them. He Himself is not under the control of the external energy; in His personal feature He is
completely devoid of the variegated manifestation of material qualities, and He is under no illusion of false
identification.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Two situations are described in this verse. One is the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the
material world, and the other is the Lord's own establishment. There is also quality in the Lord's own
establishment, the kingdom of God. lt is stated here that Goloka is His personal situation. There is also
quality in Goloka, but that quality is not divided into creation, maintenance and annihilation. In the
external energy, the interaction of the three qualities makes it possible for things to be created,
maintained and annihilated. But in the spiritual world, or the kingdom of God, there is no such
exhibition, since everything is eternal, sentient and blissful. There is a class of philosophers who
misunderstand the appearance of the Personality of Godhead within this material world. They are under
the impression that when the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears, He is under the spell of the three
qualities, like all the other living entities who appear within this material world. That is their
misunderstanding; as it is clearly stated here (sva-samsthaya), by His internal potency He is
transcendental to all these material qualities. Similarly, in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, "I appear by My
internal potency." Both the internal and external potencies are under the control of the Supreme, so He
does not come under the control of either of these potencies. Rather, everything is under His control. In
order to manifest His transcendental name, form, quality, pastimes and paraphernalia, He brings into
action His internal energy. On account of the variegatedness of the external potency, there are
manifestations of many qualitative demigods, beginning with Brahma and Lord Siva, and people are
attracted to these demigods according to their own material quality. But when one is transcendental or
surpasses the material qualities, he is simply fixed in the worship of the Supreme Personality. This fact is
explained in Bhagavad-gita: anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is already transcendental to the
variegatedness and interaction of the three material qualities. The summary is that the conditioned souls
are being pulled by the action and reaction of the material qualities, which create a differentiation of
energies. But in the spiritual world the worshipable one is the Supreme Lord and no one else.
