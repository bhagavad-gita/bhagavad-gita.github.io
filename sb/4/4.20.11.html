TRANSLATION
Anyone who knows that this material body, made of the five gross elements, the sense organs, the
working senses and the mind, is simply supervised by the fixed soul is eligible to be liberated from
material bondage.
PURPORT
This verse describes how one can become liberated from material bondage. The first point is that one
must know that the soul is different from his body. The soul is called dehi, or one who possesses the
body, and the material body is called deha, or the embodiment of the soul. The body is changing at every
moment, but the soul is fixed; therefore the soul is called kuta-stham. The change of body is enacted by
the reactions of the three modes of nature. One who has understood the fixed position of the soul should
not be disturbed by the incoming and outgoing interactions of the modes of material nature in the form of
happiness and distress. In Bhagavad-gita also, Lord Krsna recommends that since happiness and distress
come and go due to the interaction of the modes of nature on the body, one should not be disturbed by
such external movements. Even though one is sometimes absorbed in such external movements, he has to
learn to tolerate them. The living entity should be always indifferent to the action and reaction of the
external body.
Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita that the body, made of the gross physical elements (earth, water, fire,
air and sky) and the subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego), is completely different from the soul
proper. One should therefore not be disturbed by the action and reaction of these eight gross and subtle
material elements. The practical process to attain this stage of indifference is to execute devotional service.
Only one who constantly engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day can be indifferent to the
action and reaction of the external body. When a man is absorbed in a particular thought, he does not
hear or see any external activities, even though they are enacted in his presence. Similarly, those who are
fully absorbed in devotional service do not care what is going on with the external body. That status is
called samadhi. One who is actually situated in samadhi is understood to be a first-class yogi.
