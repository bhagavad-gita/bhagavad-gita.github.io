<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja said: My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After entering within me, You have
enlivened all my sleeping senses--my hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power
of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja could understand very easily the difference between his condition before and after
attaining spiritual realization and seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He could
understand that his life force and activities had been sleeping. Unless one comes to the spiritual platform,
his bodily limbs, mind and other facilities within the body are understood to be sleeping. Unless one is
spiritually situated, all his activities are taken as a dead man's activities or ghostly activities. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura has composed a song in which he addresses himself: "O living entity, get up! How
long shall you sleep on the lap of maya? Now you have the opportunity of possessing a human form of
body; now try to get up and realize yourself." The Vedas also declare, "Get up! Get up! You have the
opportunity, the boon of the human form of life--now realize yourself." These are the Vedic injunctions.
Dhruva Maharaja actually experienced that upon enlightenment of his senses on the spiritual platform
he could understand the essence of Vedic instruction--that the Supreme Godhead is the Supreme Person;
He is not impersonal. Dhruva Maharaja could immediately understand this fact. He was aware that for a
very long time he was practically sleeping, and he felt the impetus to glorify the Lord according to the
Vedic conclusion. A mundane person cannot offer any prayer or glorify the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, because he has no realization of the Vedic conclusion.
When Dhruva Maharaja, therefore, found this difference within himself, he could immediately
understand that it was because of the causeless mercy of the Lord. He offered obeisances to the Lord with
great respect and reverence, completely understanding that the Lord's favor was upon him. This spiritual
enlivenment of Dhruva Maharaja's senses and mind was due to the action of the internal potency of the
Lord. In this verse, therefore, the word sva-dhamna means "by spiritual energy." Spiritual enlightenment
is possible by the mercy of the spiritual energy of the Lord. The chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is first
addressed to the spiritual energy of the Lord, Hare. This spiritual energy acts when a living entity fully
surrenders and accepts his position as an eternal servitor. When a person places himself at the disposal or
order of the Supreme Lord, that is called sevonmukha; at that time the spiritual energy gradually reveals
the Lord to him.
Without revelation by the spiritual energy, one is unable to offer prayers glorifying the Lord. Any
amount of philosophical speculation or poetic expression by mundane persons is still considered to be the
action and reaction of the material energy. When one is actually enlivened by the spiritual energy, all his
senses become purified, and he engages only in the service of the Lord. At that time his hands, legs, ears,
tongue, mind, genitals--everything--engage in the service of the Lord. Such an enlightened devotee no
longer has any material activities, nor has he any interest in being materially engaged. This process of
purifying the senses and engaging them in the service of the Lord is known as bhakti, or devotional
service. In the beginning, the senses are engaged by the direction of the spiritual master and sastra, and
after realization, when the same senses are purified, the engagement continues. The difference is that in
the beginning the senses are engaged in a mechanical way, but after realization they are engaged in
spiritual understanding.
