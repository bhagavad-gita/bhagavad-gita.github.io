<h2>Translation</h2>
The priests addressed the Lord, saying: O Lord, transcendental to material contamination, by the curse
offered by Lord Siva's men we have become attached to fruitive activities, and thus we are now fallen and
therefore do not know anything about You. On the contrary, we are now involved in the injunctions of
the three departments of the Vedic knowledge under the plea of executing rituals in the name of yajna.
We know that You have made arrangements for distributing the respective shares of the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedas are known as traigunya-visaya vedah (Bg. 2.45). Those who are serious students of the Vedas
are very much attached to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas, and therefore these vedavadis
cannot understand that the ultimate goal of the Vedas is to understand Lord Krsna, or Visnu. Those
who have transcended the qualitative Vedic attractions, however, can understand Krsna, who is never
contaminated by the material qualities. Therefore Lord Visnu is addressed here as ananjana (free from
material contamination). In Bhagavad-gita (2.42) the crude Vedic scholars have been deprecated by Krsna
as follows:
yam imam puspitam vacam
pravadanty avipascitah
veda-vada-ratah partha
nanyad astiti vadinah
"Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, and they say that
there is nothing more than this."
