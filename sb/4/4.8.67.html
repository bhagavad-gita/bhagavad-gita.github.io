<h2>Text</h2>
atmanam ca pravayasam
akalayya visampatih
vanam viraktah pratisthad
vimrsann atmano gatim
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atmanam--himself; ca--also; pravayasam--advanced in age; akalayya--considering; visampatih--King
Uttanapada; vanam--to the forest; viraktah--detached; pratisthat--departed; vimrsan--deliberating on;
atmanah--of the self; gatim--salvation.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After considering his advanced age and deliberating on the welfare of his spiritual self, King Uttanapada
detached himself from worldly affairs and entered the forest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the sign of a rajarsi. King Uttanapada was very opulent and was emperor of the world, and these
attachments were certainly very great. Modern politicians are not as great as kings like Maharaja
Uttanapada, but because they get some political power for some days, they become so much attached to
their positions that they never retire unless they are removed from their posts by cruel death or killed by
some opposing political party. It is within our experience that the politicians in India do not quit their
positions until death. This was not the practice in olden days, as it is evident from the behavior of King
Uttanapada. Immediately after installing his worthy son Dhruva Maharaja on the throne, he left his home
and palace. There are hundreds and thousands of instances like this in which kings, in their mature age,
would give up their kingdoms and go to the forest to practice austerity. Practice of austerity is the main
business of human life. As Maharaja Dhruva practiced austerity in his early age, his father, Maharaja
Uttanapada, in his old age also practiced austerity in the forest. In modern days however, it is not possible
to give up one's home and go to the forest to practice austerity, but if people of all ages would take shelter
of the Krsna consciousness movement and practice the simple austerities of no illicit sex, no intoxication,
no gambling and no meat-eating, and chant the Hare Krsna mantra regularly (sixteen rounds), by this
practical method it would be a very easy task to get salvation from this material world.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Dhruva Maharaja Returns Home."
