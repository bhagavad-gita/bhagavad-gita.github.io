<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tasyam sandahyamanayam
sapaurah saparicchadah
kautumbikah kutumbinya
upatapyata sanvayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasyam--when that city; sandahyamanayam--was ablaze; sa-paurah--along with all the citizens; saparicchadah--
along with all servants and followers; kautumbikah--the King, having so many relatives;
kutumbinya--along with his wife; upatapyata--began to suffer the heat of the fire; sa-anvayah--along with
descendants.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the city was set ablaze, all the citizens and servants of the King, as well as all family members,
sons, grandsons, wives and other relatives, were within the fire. King Puranjana thus became very
unhappy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many parts of the body--the senses, the limbs, the skin, the muscles, blood, marrow, etc.--and
all these are considered here figuratively as sons, grandsons, citizens and dependents. When the body is
attacked by the visnu-jvara, the fiery condition becomes so acute that sometimes one remains in a coma.
This means that the body is in such severe pain that one becomes unconscious and cannot feel the
miseries taking place within the body. Indeed, the living entity becomes so helpless at the time of death
that, although unwilling, he is forced to give up the body and enter another. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated
that man may, by scientific advancement, improve the temporary living conditions, but that he cannot
avoid the pangs of birth, old age, disease and death. These are under the control of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through the agency of material nature. A foolish person cannot understand this
simple fact. Now people are very busy trying to find petroleum in the midst of the ocean. They are very
anxious to make provisions for the future petroleum supply, but they do not make any attempts to
ameliorate the conditions of birth, old age, disease and death. Thus a person in ignorance, not knowing
anything about his own future life, is certainly defeated in all his activities.
