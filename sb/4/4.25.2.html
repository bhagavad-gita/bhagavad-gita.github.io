<h2>Translation</h2>
Once the dangerous soldiers attacked the city of Puranjana with great force. Although the city was full
of paraphernalia for sense gratification, it was being protected by the old serpent.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As one's body engages in sense gratification, it becomes weaker and weaker daily. Finally the vital force
becomes so weak that it is herein compared to a weak serpent. The life air has already been compared to
the serpent. When the vital force within the body becomes weak, the body itself also becomes weak. At
such a time the death symptoms--that is, the dangerous soldiers of death's superintendent, Yamaraja--
begin to attack very severely. According to the Vedic system, before coming to such a stage one should
leave home and take sannyasa to preach the message of God for the duration of life. However, if one sits at
home and is served by his beloved wife and children, he certainly becomes weaker and weaker due to
sense gratification. When death finally comes, one leaves the body devoid of spiritual assets. At the
present time, even the oldest man in the family does not leave home, being attracted by wife, children,
money, opulence, dwelling, etc. Thus at the end of life one worries about how his wife will be protected
and how she will manage the great family responsibilities. In this way a man usually thinks of his wife
before death. According to Bhagavad-gita (8.6):
yam yam vapi smaran bhavam
tyajaty ante kalevaram
tam tam evaiti kaunteya
sada tad-bhava-bhavitah
"Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail."
At the end of life, a person thinks of what he has done throughout his whole life; thus he gets another
body (dehantara) according to his thoughts and desires at the end of life. One overly addicted to life at
home naturally thinks of his beloved wife at the end of life. Consequently, in the next life he gets the body
of a woman, and he also acquires the results of his pious or impious activities. In this chapter the
acceptance of a woman's body by King Puranjana will be thoroughly explained.
