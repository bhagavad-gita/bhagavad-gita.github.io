<h2>Text</h2>
tada vrsadhvaja-dvesakalilatma
prajapatih
sivavalokad abhavac
charad-dhrada ivamalah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tada--at that time; vrsa-dhvaja--Lord Siva, who rides on a bull; dvesa--envy; kalila-atma--polluted heart;
prajapatih--King Daksa; siva--Lord Siva; avalokat--by seeing him; abhavat--became; sarat--in the autumn;
hradah--lake; iva--like; amalah--cleansed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
At that time, when Daksa saw Lord Siva, who rides upon a bull, his heart, which was polluted by envy
of Lord Siva, was immediately cleansed, just as the water in a lake is cleansed by autumn rains.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an example of why Lord Siva is called auspicious. lf anyone sees Lord Siva with devotion and
reverence, his heart is immediately cleansed. King Daksa was polluted by envy of Lord Siva, and yet by
seeing him with a little love and devotion, his heart immediately became cleansed. In the rainy season, the
reservoirs of water become dirty and muddy, but as soon as the autumn rain comes, all the water
immediately becomes clear and transparent. Similarly, although Daksa's heart was impure because of his
having slandered Lord Siva, for which he was severely punished, Daksa now came to consciousness, and
just by seeing Lord Siva with veneration and respect, he became immediately purified.
