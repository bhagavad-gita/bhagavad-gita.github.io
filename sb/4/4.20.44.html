<h2>Translation</h2>
Whoever acquires the brahminical qualifications--whose only wealth is good behavior, who is grateful
and who takes shelter of experienced persons--gets all the opulence of the world. I therefore wish that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and His associates be pleased with the brahmana class, with the cows
and with me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped with the prayer namo brahmanya-devaya gobrahmana-
hitaya ca. Thus it is clear that the Supreme personality of Godhead respects and protects the
brahmanas and brahminical culture, as well as the cows; in other words, wherever there are brahmanas
and brahminical culture, there are cows and cow protection. In a society or civilization in which there are
no brahmanas or brahminical culture, cows are treated as ordinary animals and slaughtered, at the
sacrifice of human civilization. The specific mention of the word gavam by Prthu Maharaja is significant
because the Lord is always associated with cows and His devotees. In pictures Lord Krsna is always seen
with cows and His associates such as the cowherd boys and the gopis. Krsna, the Supreme personality of
Godhead, cannot be alone. Therefore Prthu Maharaja said, sanucaras ca, indicating that the Supreme
personality of Godhead is always associated with His followers and devotees.
A devotee acquires all the good qualities of the demigods; he is gunayanam, the reservoir of all good
qualities. His only asset is good behavior, and he is grateful. Gratitude for the mercy of the Supreme
personality of Godhead is one of the qualities of brahmanas and Vaisnavas. Everyone should feel grateful
to the Supreme personality of Godhead because He is maintaining all living entities and supplying all their
necessities. As stated in the Vedas (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13), eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: the
supreme one is supplying all necessities to the living entities. The living entity who is therefore grateful to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly qualified with good characteristics.
The word vrddhasrayam is very significant in this verse. Vrddha refers to one who is advanced in
knowledge. There are two kinds of old men--he who is advanced in years and he who is experienced in
knowledge. One who is advanced in knowledge is actually vrddha (jnana-vrddha); one does not become
vrddha simply by advancing in age. Vrddhasrayam, a person who takes shelter of a superior person who is
advanced in knowledge, can acquire all the good qualities of a brahmana and be trained in good behavior.
When one actually attains good qualities, becomes grateful for the mercy of the Supreme personality of
Godhead and takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, he is endowed with all opulence. Such a person
is a brahmana or Vaisnava. Therefore Prthu Maharaja invokes the blessings and mercy of the Supreme
personality of Godhead, with His associates, devotees, Vaisnavas, brahmanas and cows.
