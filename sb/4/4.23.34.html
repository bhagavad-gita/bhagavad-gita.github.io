<h2>Text</h2>
ihadya santam atmanam
vidama na tatah param
yeneyam nirmita vira
puri saranam atmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iha--here; adya--today; santam--existing; atmanam--living entities; vidama--that much we know; na--
not; tatah param--beyond that; yena--by whom; iyam--this; nirmita--created; vira--O great hero; puri--city;
saranam--resting place; atmanah--of all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O great hero, we only know that we are existing in this place. We do not know what will come after.
Indeed, we are so foolish that we do not care to understand who has created this beautiful place for our
residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This lack of Krsna consciousness is called ignorance. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.5) it is called
parabhavas tavad abodha jatah. Everyone is born ignorant. The Bhagavatam therefore says that we are all
born ignorant within this material world. In our ignorance we may create nationalism, philanthropy,
internationalism, science, philosophy and so many other things. The basic principle behind all these is
ignorance. What then is the value of all this advancement of knowledge if the basic principle is ignorance?
Unless a person comes to Krsna consciousness, all of his activities are defeated. This human form of life is
especially meant to dissipate ignorance, but without understanding how to dissipate ignorance people are
planning and building many things. After death, however, all of this is finished.
