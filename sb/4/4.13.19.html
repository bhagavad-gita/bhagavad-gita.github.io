<h2>Text</h2>
tasya rajno maha-bhaga
bhagavan bhuta-bhavanah
paritusyati visvatma
tisthato nija-sasane
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--with him; rajnah--the king; maha-bhaga--O noble one; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; bhuta-bhavanah--who is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation; paritusyati--becomes
satisfied; visva-atma--the Supersoul of the entire universe; tisthatah--being situated; nija-sasane--in his
own governing situation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O noble one, if the king sees that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original cause of the cosmic
manifestation and the Supersoul within everyone, is worshiped, the Lord will be satisfied.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is a fact that the government's duty is to see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by
the activities of the people as well as by the activities of the government. There is no possibility of
happiness if the government or citizenry have no idea of Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, or if they have no knowledge of bhuta-bhavana,
who is visvatma, or the Supersoul, the soul of everyone's soul. The conclusion is that without engaging in
devotional service, neither the citizens nor the government can be happy in any way. At the present
moment neither the king nor the governing body is interested in seeing that the people are engaged in the
devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, they are more interested in advancing
the machinery of sense gratification. Consequently they are becoming more and more implicated in the
complex machinery of the stringent laws of nature. People should be freed from the entanglement of the
three modes of material nature, and the only process by which this is possible is surrender unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is advised in Bhagavad-gita. Unfortunately neither the government
nor the people in general have any idea of this; they are simply interested in sense gratification and in
being happy in this life. The word nija-sasane ("in his own governmental duty") indicates that both the
government and the citizens are responsible for the execution of varnasrama-dharma. Once the populace
is situated in the varnasrama-dharma, there is every possibility of real life and prosperity both in this
world and in the next.
