<h2>Text</h2>
upagiyamano lalitam
tatra tatra ca gayakaih
kridan parivrtah stribhir
hradinim avisac chucau
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
upagiyamanah--being sung about; lalitam--very nicely; tatra tatra--here and there; ca--also; gayakaih--by
the singers; kridan--playing; parivrtah--surrounded; stribhih--by women; hradinim--in the water of the
river; avisat--entered; sucau--when it was too hot.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Many professional singers used to sing about the glories of King Puranjana and his glorious activities.
When it was too hot in the summer, he used to enter a reservoir of water. He would surround himself
with many women and enjoy their company.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A living being has different activities in different stages of life. One stage is called jagrata, or the life of
awakening, and another is called svapna, or the life of dream. Another stage is called susupti, or life in an
unconscious state, and still another stage occurs after death. In the previous verse the life of awakening
was described; that is, the man and the woman were married and enjoyed life for one hundred years. In
this verse life in the dream state is described, for the activities Puranjana accomplished during the day
were also reflected at night in the dream state. Puranjana used to live with his wife for sense enjoyment,
and at night this very sense enjoyment was appreciated in different ways. A man sleeps very soundly when
he is greatly fatigued, and when a rich man is greatly fatigued he goes to his garden house with many
female friends and there enters the water and enjoys their company. Such is the tendency of the living
entity within this material world. A living entity is never satisfied with a woman unless he is trained in the
system of brahmacarya. Generally a man's tendency is to enjoy many women, and even at the very end of
life the sex impulse is so strong that even though one is very old he still wants to enjoy the company of
young girls. Thus because of the strong sex impulse the living entity becomes more and more involved in
this material world.
