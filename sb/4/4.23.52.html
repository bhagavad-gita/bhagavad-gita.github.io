<h2>Text</h2>
asuri nama pascad dvas
taya yati puranjanah
gramakam nama visayam
durmadena samanvitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asuri--of the name Asuri; nama--called; pascat--on the western side; dvah--gate; taya--by which; yati--
used to go; puranjanah--King Puranjana; gramakam--of the name Gramaka; nama--called; visayam--the
city of sense enjoyment; durmadena--by Durmada; samanvitah--accompanied.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
On the western side was a gate named Asuri. Through that gate King Puranjana used to go to the city of
Gramaka, accompanied by his friend Durmada.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The gate on the western side of the city was known as Asuri because it was especially meant for the
asuras. The word asura refers to those who are interested in sense gratification, specifically in sex life, to
which they are overly attracted. Thus Puranjana, the living entity, enjoys himself to his greatest
satisfaction by means of the genitals. Consequently he used to go to the place known as Gramaka.
Material sense gratification is also called gramya, and the place where sex life is indulged in to a great
extent is called Gramaka. When going to Gramaka, Puranjana used to be accompanied by his friend
Durmada. The word visaya refers to the four bodily necessities of life--eating, sleeping, mating and
defending. The word durmadena may be analyzed in this way: dur means dusta, or "sinful," and mada
means "madness." Every living entity who is in contact with material nature is called mada, or mad. It is
said:
pisaci paile yena mati-cchanna haya
maya-grasta jivera haya se bhava udaya
(Prema-vivarta)
When a person is haunted, he becomes practically insane. When one is in an insane condition, he
speaks all kinds of nonsense. Thus to become engaged in sense gratification, one has to accept a friend
who is durmada, or badly affected by the material disease.
The words asuri nama pascad dvah are significant in another sense. The sunrise is first visible from the
eastern side--the Bay of Bengal--and gradually it progresses toward the west. It is practically experienced
that people in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu Himself has
certified: pascimera loka saba mudha anacara (Cc. Adi 10.89). The more one goes to the western side, the
more he will find people disinterested in spiritual life. He will find them behaving against the Vedic
standards. Because of this, people living in the West are more addicted to sense gratification. In this
Bhagavatam it is confirmed: asuri nama pascad dvah. In other words, the population on the western side
is interested in an asuric civilization, that is, a materialistic way of life. Lord Caitanya consequently
wanted this Krsna consciousness movement to be preached on the western side of the world so that
people addicted to sense gratification might be benefited by His teachings.
