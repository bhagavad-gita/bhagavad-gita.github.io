<h2>Text</h2>
matir vidusita devaih
patadbhir asahisnubhih
yo narada-vacas tathyam
nagrahisam asattamah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
matih--intelligence; vidusita--contaminated; devaih--by the demigods; patadbhih--who will fall down;
asahisnubhih--intolerant; yah--I who; narada--of the great sage Narada; vacah--of the instructions;
tathyam--the truth; na--not; agrahisam--could accept; asat-tamah--the most wretched.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Since all the demigods who are situated in the higher planetary system will have to come down again,
they are all envious of my being elevated to Vaikunthaloka by devotional service. These intolerant
demigods have dissipated my intelligence, and only for this reason could I not accept the genuine
benediction of the instructions of Sage Narada.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As shown by many instances in the Vedic literature, when a person undergoes severe austerities, the
demigods become very much perturbed because they are always afraid of losing their posts as the
predominating deities of the heavenly planets. It is known to them that their position in the higher
planetary system is impermanent, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, Ninth Chapter (ksine punye martyalokam
visanti). It is said in the Gita that after exhausting the results of their pious activities, all the
demigods, who are inhabitants of the higher planetary system, have to come back again to this earth.
It is a fact that the demigods control the different activities of the limbs of our bodies. Factually we are
not free even in moving our eyelids. Everything is controlled by them. Dhruva Maharaja's conclusion is
that these demigods, being envious of his superior position in devotional service, conspired against him to
pollute his intelligence, and thus although he was the disciple of a great Vaisnava, Narada Muni, he could
not accept Narada's valid instructions. Now Dhruva Maharaja regretted very much that he had neglected
these instructions. Narada Muni had asked him, "Why should you bother about insult or adoration from
your stepmother?" He of course said to Dhruva Maharaja that since Dhruva was only a child, what did he
have to do with such insult or adoration? But Dhruva Maharaja was determined to achieve the
benediction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore Narada advised him to go back home
for the time being, and in mature time he could try to practice devotional service. Dhruva Maharaja
regretted that he had rejected the advice of Narada Muni and was adamant in asking him for something
perishable, namely revenge against his stepmother for her insult, and possession of the kingdom of his
father.
Dhruva Maharaja regretted very much that he could not take seriously the instruction of his spiritual
master and that his consciousness was therefore contaminated. Still, the Lord is so merciful that due to
Dhruva's execution of devotional service He offered Dhruva the ultimate Vaisnava goal.
