<h2>Text</h2>
ayuso 'pacayam jantos
tathaivopacayam vibhuh
ubhabhyam rahitah sva-stho
duhsthasya vidadhaty asau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ayusah--of duration of life; apacayam--diminution; jantoh--of the living entities; tatha--similarly; eva--
also; upacayam--increase; vibhuh--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; ubhabhyam--from both of them;
rahitah--free; sva-sthah--always situated in His transcendental position; duhsthasya--of the living entities
under the laws of karma; vidadhati--awards; asau--He.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is all-powerful, and He awards the results of one's fruitive
activities. Thus, although one living entity's duration of life is very small whereas that of another is very
great, He is always in His transcendental position, and there is no question of lessening or increasing His
duration of life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both the mosquito and Lord Brahma are living entities in the material world; both are minute sparks
and are part of the Supreme Lord. The very short duration of the life of the mosquito and the very long
lifetime of Lord Brahma are both awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the results
of their karma. But in the Brahma-samhita we find it said, karmani nirdahati: the Lord diminishes or
vanquishes the reactions of devotees. The same fact is explained in Bhagavad-gita Yajnarthat karmano
'nyatra: one should perform karma only for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord, otherwise one is
bound by the action and reaction of karma. Under the laws of karma a living entity wanders within the
universe under the rule of eternal time, and sometimes he becomes a mosquito and sometimes Lord
Brahma. To a sane man this business is not very fruitful. Bhagavad-gita (9.25) gives a warning to the
living entities: yanti deva-vrata devan--those who are addicted to the worship of the demigods go to the
planets of the demigods, and those who are addicted to worship of the Pitas, forefathers, go to the Pitas.
Those who are inclined to material activities remain in the material sphere. But persons who engage in
devotional service reach the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, where there is neither birth
nor death nor different varieties of life under the influence of the law of karma. The best interest of the
living entity is to engage himself in devotional service and go back home, back to Godhead. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura advised: "My friend, you are being washed away in material nature's waves of time.
Please try to understand that you are the eternal servant of the Lord. Then everything will stop, and you
will be eternally happy."
