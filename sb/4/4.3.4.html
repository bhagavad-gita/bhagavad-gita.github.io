<h2>Translation</h2>
While the sacrifice was being performed, many brahmarsis, great sages, ancestral demigods and other
demigods, their wives all very nicely decorated with ornaments, attended from different parts of the
universe.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In any auspicious ceremony, such as a marriage ceremony, sacrificial ceremony or puja ceremony, it is
auspicious for married women to decorate themselves very nicely with ornaments, fine clothing and
cosmetics. These are auspicious signs. Many heavenly women assembled with their husbands, the
devarsis, demigods and rajarsis, in that great sacrifice named brhaspati-sava. It is specifically mentioned in
this verse that they approached with their husbands, for when a woman is decorated nicely, her husband
becomes more cheerful. The nice decorations, ornaments and dress of the wives of the demigods and
sages and the cheerfulness of the demigods and sages themselves were all auspicious signs for the
ceremony.

<h2>Translation</h2>
The chaste lady Sati, the daughter of Daksa, heard the heavenly denizens flying in the sky conversing
about the great sacrifice being performed by her father. When she saw that from all directions the
beautiful wives of the heavenly denizens, their eyes very beautifully glittering, were near her residence
and were going to the sacrifice dressed in fine clothing and ornamented with earrings and necklaces with
lockets, she approached her husband, the master of the bhutas, in great anxiety, and spoke as follows.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that the residence of Lord Siva was not on this planet but somewhere in outer space,
otherwise how could Sati have seen the airplanes coming from different directions towards this planet and
heard the passengers talking about the great sacrifice being performed by Daksa? Sati is described here as
Daksayani because she was the daughter of Daksa. The mention of upadeva-vara refers to inferior
demigods like the Gandharvas, Kinnaras and Uragas, who are not exactly demigods but between the
demigods and human beings. They were also coming in planes. The word sva-nilayabhyase indicates that
they were passing right near her residential quarters. The dresses and bodily features of the wives of the
heavenly denizens are very nicely described here. Their eyes moved, their earrings and other ornaments
glittered and glared, their dresses were the nicest possible, and all of them had special lockets on their
necklaces. Each woman was accompanied by her husband. Thus they looked so beautiful that Sati,
Daksayani, was impelled to dress similarly and go to the sacrifice with her husband. That is the natural
inclination of a woman.
