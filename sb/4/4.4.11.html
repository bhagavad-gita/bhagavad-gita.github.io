<h2>Translation</h2>
The blessed goddess said: Lord Siva is the most beloved of all living entities. He has no rival. No one is
very dear to him, and no one is his enemy. No one but you could be envious of such a universal being,
who is free from all enmity.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (9.29) the Lord says, samo'ham sarva-bhutesu: "I am equal to all living entities."
Similarly, Lord Siva is a qualitative incarnation of the Supreme personality of Godhead, so he has almost
the same qualities as the Supreme Lord. Therefore he is equal to everyone; no one is his enemy, and no
one is his friend, but one who is envious by nature can become the enemy of Lord Siva. Therefore Sati
accused her father, "No one but you could be envious of Lord Siva or be his enemy." Other sages and
learned brahmanas were present, but they were not envious of Lord Siva, although they were all
dependent on Daksa. Therefore no one but Daksa could be envious of Lord Siva. That was the accusation
of Sati.
