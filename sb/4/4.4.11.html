TRANSLATION
This manifested cosmos is a wonderful creation of the interaction of the three material modes, or the
external energy of the Supreme Lord. This truth is fully known to you. Yet I am but a poor woman, and,
as you know, I am not conversant with the truth. Therefore I wish to see my birthplace once more.
PURPORT
Daksayani, Sati, knew very well that her husband, Lord Siva, was not very much interested in the
glaring manifestation of the material world, which is caused by the interaction of the three modes of
nature. Therefore she addressed her husband as aja, which refers to one who has transcended the bondage
of birth and death, or one who has realized his eternal position. She stated, "The illusion of accepting the
perverted reflection, the material or cosmic manifestation, to be real is not present in you, because you are
self-realized. For you the attraction of social life and the consideration that someone is father, someone is
mother and someone is sister, which are illusory relationships, is already over; but because I am a poor
woman, I am not so advanced in transcendental realization. Therefore naturally these appear to me as
real." Only less intelligent persons accept this perverted reflection of the spiritual world to be real. Those
who are under the spell of the external energy accept this manifestation to be fact, whereas those who are
advanced in spiritual realization know that it is illusion. Actual reality is elsewhere, in the spiritual world.
"But as far as I am concerned," Sati said, "I do not have much knowledge about self-realization. I am poor
because I do not know the actual facts. I am attracted by my birthplace, and I want to see it." One who has
attraction for his birthplace, for his body, and for other such items mentioned in the Bhagavatam is
considered to be like an ass or a cow. Sati might have heard all this many times from her husband, Lord
Siva, but because she was a woman, yosit, she still hankered after the same material objects of affection.
The word yosit means "one who is enjoyed." Therefore woman is called yosit. In spiritual advancement,
association with yosit is always restricted because if one is like a play doll in the hands of yosit, then all
his spiritual advancement is at once stopped. It is said, "Those who are just like playthings in the hands of
a woman (yosit-krida-mrgesu) cannot make any advancement in spiritual realization."
