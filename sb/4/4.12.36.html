<h2>Translation</h2>
The self-effulgent Vaikuntha planets, by whose illumination alone all the illuminating planets within
this material world give off reflected light, cannot be reached by those who are not merciful to other living
entities. Only persons who constantly engage in welfare activities for other living entities can reach the
Vaikuntha planets.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is a description of two aspects of the Vaikuntha planets. The first is that in the Vaikuntha sky there
is no need of the sun and moon. This is confirmed by the Upanisads as well as Bhagavad-gita (na tad
bhasayate suryo na sasanko na pavakah). In the spiritual world the Vaikunthalokas are themselves
illuminated; there is therefore no need of sun, moon or electric light. It is in fact the illumination of the
Vaikunthalokas which is reflected in the material sky. Only by this reflection are the suns in the material
universes illuminated; after the illumination of the sun, all the stars and moons are illuminated. In other
words, all the luminaries in the material sky borrow illumination from Vaikunthaloka. From this material
world, however, people can be transferred to the Vaikunthaloka, if they incessantly engage in welfare
activities for all other living entities. Such incessant welfare activities can really be performed only in
Krsna consciousness. There is no philanthropic work within this material world but Krsna consciousness
that can engage a person twenty-four hours a day.
A Krsna conscious being is always engaged in planning how to take all of suffering humanity back
home, back to Godhead. Even if one is not successful in reclaiming all the fallen souls back to Godhead,
still, because he is Krsna conscious, his path to Vaikunthaloka is open. He personally becomes qualified to
enter the Vaikunthalokas, and if anyone follows such a devotee, he also enters into Vaikunthaloka.
Others, who engage in envious activities, are known as karmis. Karmis are envious of one another. Simply
for sense gratification, they can kill thousands of innocent animals. Jnanis are not as sinful as karmis, but
they do not try to reclaim others back to Godhead. They perform austerities for their own liberation.
Yogis are also engaged in self-aggrandizement by trying to attain mystic powers. But devotees, Vaisnavas,
who are servants of the Lord, come forward in the actual field of work in Krsna consciousness to reclaim
fallen souls. Only Krsna conscious persons are eligible to enter into the spiritual world. That is clearly
stated in this verse and is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, wherein the Lord says that there is no one dearer to
Him than those who preach the gospel of Bhagavad-gita to the world.
