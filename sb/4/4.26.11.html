<h2>Text</h2>
nalini nalini nase
gandhah saurabha ucyate
ghrano 'vadhuto mukhyasyam
vipano vag rasavid rasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nalini--named Nalini; nalini--named Nalini; nase--the two nostrils; gandhah--aroma; saurabhah--
Saurabha (fragrance); ucyate--is called; ghranah--the sense of smell; avadhutah--called Avadhuta;
mukhya--called Mukhya (principal); asyam--the mouth; vipanah--named Vipana; vak--the faculty of

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The two doors named Nalini and Nalini should be known as the two nostrils, and the city named
Saurabha represents aroma. The companion spoken of as Avadhuta is the sense of smell. The door called
Mukhya is the mouth, and Vipana is the faculty of speech. Rasajna is the sense of taste.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word avadhuta means "most free." A person is not under the rules and regulations of any
injunction when he has attained the stage of avadhuta. In other words, he can act as he likes. This
avadhuta stage is exactly like air, which does not care for any obstruction. In Bhagavad-gita (6.34) it is
said:
cancalam hi manah krsna
pramathi balavad drdham
tasyaham nigraham manye
vayor iva suduskaram
"The mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krsna, and to subdue it is, it seems to me,
more difficult than controlling the wind."
Just as the air or wind cannot be checked by anyone, the two nostrils, situated in one place, enjoy the
sense of smell without impediment. When the tongue is present, the mouth continually tastes all kinds of
relishable foodstuffs.
