All the sages and demigods, headed by Indra, offered their respectful obeisances unto Lord Siva with
folded hands. Lord Siva was dressed in saffron garments and absorbed in trance, thus appearing to be the
foremost of all sages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word brahmananda is significant. This brahmananda, or brahma-nirvana, is explained
by Prahlada Maharaja. When one is completely absorbed in the adhoksaja, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is beyond the sense perception of materialistic persons, one is situated in brahmananda.
It is impossible to conceive of the existence, name, form, quality and pastimes of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because He is transcendentally situated beyond the conception of materialistic
persons. Because materialists cannot imagine or conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they
may think that God is dead, but factually He is always existing in His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, His eternal
form. Constant meditation concentrated on the form of the Lord is called samadhi, ecstasy or trance.
Samadhi means particularly concentrated attention, so one who has achieved the qualification of always
meditating on the Personality of Godhead is to be understood to be always in trance and enjoying
brahma-nirvana, or brahmananda. Lord Siva exhibited those symptoms, and therefore it is stated that he
was absorbed in brahmananda.
Another significant word is yoga-kaksam. Yoga-kaksa is the sitting posture in which the left thigh is
fixed under one's tightly knotted saffron-colored garment. Also the words manunam adyam are significant
here because they mean a philosopher, or one who is thoughtful and can think very nicely. Such a man is
called manu. Lord Siva is described in this verse as the chief of all thinkers. Lord Siva, of course, does not
engage in useless mental speculation, but as stated in the previous verse, he is always thoughtful regarding
how to deliver the demons from their fallen condition of life. It is said that during the advent of Lord
Caitanya, Sadasiva appeared as Advaita Prabhu, and Advaita Prabhu's chief concern was to elevate the
fallen conditioned souls to the platform of devotional service to Lord Krsna. Since people were engaged in
useless occupations which would continue their material existence, Lord Siva, in the form of Lord
Advaita, appealed to the Supreme Lord to appear as Lord Caitanya to deliver these illusioned souls.
Actually Lord Caitanya appeared on the request of Lord Advaita. Similarly, Lord Siva has a sampradaya,
the Rudra-sampradaya. He is always thinking about the deliverance of the fallen souls, as exhibited by
Lord Advaita Prabhu.
