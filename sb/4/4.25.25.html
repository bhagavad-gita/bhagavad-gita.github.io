<h2>Text</h2>
tam aha lalitam virah

<br>

smiling; sobhanam--very beautiful; snigdhena--by sex desire; apanga-punkhena--by the arrow of glancing;
sprstah--thus pierced; prema-udbhramat--exciting love; bhruva--by the eyebrows.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Puranjana, the hero, became attracted by the eyebrows and smiling face of the very beautiful girl and
was immediately pierced by the arrows of her lusty desires. When she smiled shyly, she looked very
beautiful to Puranjana, who, although a hero, could not refrain from addressing her.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living entity is a hero in two ways. When he is a victim of the illusory energy, he works as a great
hero in the material world, as a great leader, politician, businessman, industrialist, etc., and his heroic
activities contribute to the material advancement of civilization. One can also become a hero by being
master of the senses, a gosvami. Material activities are false heroic activities, whereas restraining the
senses from material engagement is great heroism. However great a hero one may be in the material
world, he can be immediately conquered by the lumps of flesh and blood known as the breasts of women.
In the history of material activities there are many examples, like the Roman hero Antony, who became
captivated by the beauty of Cleopatra. Similarly, a great hero in India named Baji Rao became a victim of a
woman during the time of Maharashtrian politics, and he was defeated. From history we understand that
formerly politicians used to employ beautiful girls who were trained as visa-kanya. These girls had poison
injected into their bodies from the beginning of their lives so that in due course of time they would
become so immune to the poison and so poisonous themselves that simply by kissing a person they could
kill him. These poisonous girls were engaged to see an enemy and kill him with a kiss. Thus there are
many instances in human history of heroes who have been curbed simply by women. Being part and
parcel of Krsna, the living entity is certainly a great hero, but due to his own weakness he becomes
attracted to the material features.
krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga-vancha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
It is said in the prema-vivarta that when a living entity wants to enjoy material nature, he is immediately
victimized by the material energy. A living entity is not forced to come into the material world. He makes
his own choice, being attracted by beautiful women. Every living entity has the freedom to be attracted by
material nature or to stand as a hero and resist that attraction. It is simply a question of the living entity's
being attracted or not being attracted. There is no question of his being forced to come into contact with
material energy. One who can keep himself steady and resist the attraction of material nature is certainly a
hero and deserves to be called a gosvami. Unless one is master of the senses, he cannot become a gosvami.
The living entity can take one of two positions in this world. He may become a servant of his senses, or he
may become master of them. By becoming a servant of the senses, one becomes a great material hero, and
by becoming master of the senses, he becomes a gosvami, or spiritual hero.
