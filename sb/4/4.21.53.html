<h2>Translation</h2>
Being situated in the liberated position of devotional service, Prthu Maharaja not only performed all
fruitive activities but also begot five sons by his wife, Arci. Indeed, all his sons were begotten according to
his own desire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As a householder, Prthu Maharaja had five sons by his wife, Arci, and all these sons were begotten as he
desired them. They were not born whimsically or by accident. How one can beget children according to
one's own desire is practically unknown in the present age (Kali-yuga). In this regard the secret of success
depends on the parents' acceptance of the various purificatory methods known as samskaras. The first
samskara, the garbhadhana-samskara, or child-begetting samskara, is compulsory, especially for the
higher castes, the brahmanas and the ksatriyas. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, sex life which is not against
religious principles is Krsna Himself, and according to religious principles, when one wants to beget a
child he must perform the garbhadhana-samskara before having sex. The mental state of the father and
mother before sex will certainly affect the mentality of the child to be begotten. A child who is begotten
out of lust may not turn out as the parents desire. As stated in the sastras, yatha yonir yatha bijam. Yatha
yonih indicates the mother, and yatha bijam indicates the father. If the mental state of the parents is
prepared before they have sex, the child which they will beget will certainly reflect their mental condition.
It is therefore understood by the words atma-sammatan that both Prthu Maharaja and Arci underwent the
garbhadhana purificatory process before begetting children, and thus they begot all their sons according
to their desires and purified mental states. Prthu Maharaja did not beget his children out of lust, nor was
he attracted to his wife for sense gratificatory purposes. He begot the children as a grhastha for the future
administration of his government all over the world.
