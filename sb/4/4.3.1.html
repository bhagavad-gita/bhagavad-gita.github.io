<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
sada vidvisator evam
kalo vai dhriyamanayoh
jamatuh svasurasyapi
sumahan aticakrame
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--Maitreya said; sada--constantly; vidvisatoh--the tension; evam--in this manner; kalah--
time; vai--certainly; dhriyamanayoh--continued to bear; jamatuh--of the son-in-law; svasurasya--of the
father-in-law; api--even; su-mahan--a very great; aticakrame--passed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya continued: In this manner the tension between the father-in-law and son-in-law, Daksa and
Lord Siva, continued for a considerably long period.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The previous chapter has already explained that Vidura questioned the sage Maitreya as to the cause of
the misunderstanding between Lord Siva and Daksa. Another question is why the strife between Daksa
and his son-in-law caused Sati to destroy her body. The chief reason for Sati's giving up her body was that
her father, Daksa, began another sacrificial performance, to which Lord Siva was not invited at all.
Generally, when any sacrifice is performed, although each and every sacrifice is intended to pacify the
Supreme personality of Godhead, Visnu, all the demigods, especially Lord Brahma and Lord Siva and the
other principal demigods, such as Indra and Candra, are invited, and they take part. lt is said that unless
all the demigods are present, no sacrifice is complete. But in the tension between the father-in-law and
son-in-law, Daksa began another yajna performance, to which Lord Siva was not invited. Daksa was the
chief progenitor employed by Lord Brahma, and he was a son of Brahma, so he had a high position and
was also very proud.
