<h2>Text</h2>
nirupitah praja-palah
sa jighamsati vai prajah
tathapi santvayemamum
nasmams tat-patakam sprset
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nirupitah--appointed; praja-palah--the king; sah--he; jighamsati--desires to harm; vai--certainly; prajah--
the citizens; tatha api--nevertheless; santvayema--we should pacify; amum--him; na--not; asman--us; tat--
his; patakam--sinful result; sprset--may touch.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We appointed this Vena king of the state in order to give protection to the citizens, but now he has
become the enemy of the citizens. Despite all these discrepancies, we should at once try to pacify him. By
doing so, we may not be touched by the sinful results caused by him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The saintly sages elected King Vena to become king, but he proved to be mischievous; therefore the
sages were very much afraid of incurring sinful reaction. The law of karma prohibits a person even to
associate with a mischievous individual. By electing Vena to the throne, the saintly sages certainly
associated with him. Ultimately King Vena became so mischievous that the saintly sages actually became
afraid of becoming contaminated by his activities. Thus before taking any action against him, the sages
tried to pacify and correct him so that he might turn from his mischief.
