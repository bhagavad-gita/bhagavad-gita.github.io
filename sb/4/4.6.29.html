<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva said: My dear Lord, my mind and consciousness are always fixed on Your lotus feet, which, as
the source of all benediction and the fulfillment of all desires, are worshiped by all liberated great sages
because Your lotus feet are worthy of worship. With my mind fixed on Your lotus feet, I am no longer
disturbed by persons who blaspheme me, claiming that my activities are not purified. I do not mind their
accusations, and I excuse them out of compassion, just as You exhibit compassion toward all living
entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva expresses herein his regret at having been angry and having disturbed the sacrificial activities
of Daksa. King Daksa had insulted him in many ways, and thus he had become angry and had frustrated
the entire sacrificial ceremony. Later, when he was pleased, the yajna performances were reinstituted, and
therefore he regretted his activities. Now he says that because his mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the
Supreme Lord, Visnu, he is no longer disturbed by the ordinary critics of his way of life. From this
statement by Lord Siva it is understood that as long as one is on the material platform one is affected by
the three modes of material nature. As soon as one is in Krsna consciousness, however, one is no longer
affected by such material activities. One should therefore always be fixed in Krsna consciousness, busy in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord. It is guaranteed that such a devotee will never be affected by
the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature. This fact is also corroborated in Bhagavadgita:
anyone who is fixed in the transcendental service of the Lord has surpassed all the material qualities
and is situated in the status of Brahman realization, in which one is not afflicted by hankering for material
objects. The recommendation of the Srimad-Bhagavatam is that one should always be Krsna conscious
and should never forget his transcendental relationship with the Lord. This program has to be followed
strictly by everyone. From the statement of Lord Siva it is understood that he was always in Krsna
consciousness, and thus he remained free from material affliction. The only remedy, therefore, is to
continue Krsna consciousness rigidly, in order to get out of the contamination of the material modes.
