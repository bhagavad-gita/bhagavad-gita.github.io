<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The reciters continued: No one will be able to understand the policies the King will follow. His activities
will also be very confidential, and it will not be possible for anyone to know how he will make every
activity successful. His treasury will always remain unknown to everyone. He will be the reservoir of
unlimited glories and good qualities, and his position will be maintained and covered just as Varuna, the
deity of the seas, is covered all around by water.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a predominating deity for all the material elements, and Varuna, or Praceta, is the
predominating deity of the seas and the oceans. From outward appearances the seas and oceans are
devoid of life, but a person acquainted with the sea knows that within the water exist many varieties of
life. The king of that underwater kingdom is Varuna. Just as no one can understand what is going on
beneath the sea, no one could understand what policy King Prthu was following to make everything
successful. Indeed, King Prthu's path of diplomacy was very grave. His success was made possible because
he was a reservoir of unlimited glorified qualities.
The word upagupta-vittah is very significant in this verse. It indicates that no one would know the
extent of the riches King Prthu would confidentially keep. The idea is that not only the king but everyone
should keep his hard-earned money confidentially and secretly so that in due course of time the money
can be spent for good, practical purposes. In Kali-yuga, however, the king or government has no wellprotected
treasury, and the only means of circulation is currency notes made of paper. Thus in times of
distress the government artificially inflates the currency by simply printing papers, and this artificially
raises the price of commodities, and the general condition of the citizens becomes very precarious. Thus
keeping one's money very secretly is an old practice, for we find this practice present even during the
reign of Maharaja Prthu. Just as the king has the right to keep his treasury confidential and secret, the
people should also keep their individual earnings a secret. There is no fault in such dealings. The main
point is that everyone should be trained in the system of varnasrama-dharma so that the money is spent
only for good causes and nothing else.
