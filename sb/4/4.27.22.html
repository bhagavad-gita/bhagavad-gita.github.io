<h2>Text</h2>
pracetasa ucuh
namo namah klesa-vinasanaya
nirupitodara-gunahvayaya
mano-vaco-vega-puro-javaya
sarvaksa-margair agatadhvane namah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pracetasah ucuh--the Pracetas said; namah--obeisances; namah--obeisances; klesa--material distress;
vinasanaya--unto one who destroys; nirupita--settled; udara--magnanimous; guna--qualities; ahvayaya--
whose name; manah--of the mind; vacah--of speech; vega--the speed; purah--before; javaya--whose speed;
sarva-aksa--of all material senses; margaih--by the paths; agata--not perceivable; adhvane--whose course;
namah--we offer our respects.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Pracetas spoke as follows: Dear Lord, You relieve all kinds of material distress. Your magnanimous
transcendental qualities and holy name are all-auspicious. This conclusion is already settled. You can go
faster than the speed of mind and words. You cannot be perceived by material senses. We therefore offer
You respectful obeisances again and again.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word nirupita, meaning "concluded," is very significant in this verse. No one has to conduct
research work to find God or make progress in spiritual knowledge. Everything is conclusively there in
the Vedas. Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah:
understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the process of the Vedas is perfect and
conclusive. The Vedas state, atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: the transcendental
names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of the Lord cannot be understood by our blunt
material senses. Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: when a devotee engages his senses
favorably in devotional service, the Lord, through His causeless mercy, reveals Himself to the devotee.
This is the conclusive Vedic process. The Vedas also indicate that simply by chanting the holy names of
the Lord one can without a doubt become spiritually advanced. We cannot approach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by the speed of mind or words, but if we stick to devotional service we can easily
and quickly approach Him. In other words, the Supreme Lord is attracted by devotional service, and He
can approach us more swiftly than we can approach Him with our mental speculation. The Lord has
stated that He is beyond the range of mental speculation and the speed of thought, yet He can be
approached easily by His causeless mercy. Thus only by His causeless mercy can He be attained. Other
methods will not be effective.
