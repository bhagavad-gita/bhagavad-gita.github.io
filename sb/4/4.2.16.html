<h2>Text</h2>
tasma unmada-nathaya
nasta-saucaya durhrde
datta bata maya sadhvi
codite paramesthina
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmai--to him; unmada-nathaya--to the lord of ghosts; nasta-saucaya--being devoid of all cleanliness;
durhrde--heart filled with nasty things; datta--was given; bata--alas; maya--by me; sadhvi--Sati; codite--
being requested; paramesthina--by the supreme teacher (Brahma).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
On the request of Lord Brahma I handed over my chaste daughter to him, although he is devoid of all
cleanliness and his heart is filled with nasty things.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is the duty of parents to hand over their daughters to suitable persons just befitting their family
tradition in cleanliness, gentle behavior, wealth, social position, etc. Daksa was repentant that on the
request of Brahma, who was his father, he had handed over his daughter to a person who, according to his
calculation, was nasty. He was so angry that he did not acknowledge that the request was from his father.
Instead, he referred to Brahma as paramesthi, the supreme teacher in the universe; because of his
temperament of gross anger, he was not even prepared to accept Brahma as his father. In other words, he
accused even Brahma of being less intelligent because he had advised Daksa to hand over his beautiful
daughter to such a nasty fellow. In anger one forgets everything, and thus Daksa, in anger, not only
accused the great Lord Siva, but criticized his own father, Lord Brahma, for his not very astute advice that
Daksa hand over his daughter to Lord Siva.
