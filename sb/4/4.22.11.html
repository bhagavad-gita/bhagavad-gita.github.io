<h2>Text</h2>
vyalalaya-druma vai tesv
ariktakhila-sampadah
yad-grhas tirtha-padiyapadatirtha-
vivarjitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vyala--venomous serpents; alaya--home; drumah--tree; vai--certainly; tesu--in those houses; arikta--
abundantly; akhila--all; sampadah--opulences; yat--that; grhah--houses; tirtha-padiya--in relation with the
feet of great saintly persons; pada-tirtha--the water which washed their feet; vivarjitah--without.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
On the contrary, even though full of all opulence and material prosperity, any householder's house
where the devotees of the Lord are never allowed to come in, and where there is no water for washing
their feet, is to be considered a tree in which all venomous serpents live.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word tirtha-padiya indicates devotees of Lord Visnu, or Vaisnavas. As far as brahmanas
are concerned, in the previous verse the mode of reception has been already described. Now, in this verse,
special stress is being given to the Vaisnavas. Generally the sannyasis, or those in the renounced order of
life, take trouble to enlighten the householders. There are ekadandi sannyasis and tridandi sannyasis. The
ekadandi sannyasis are generally followers of Sankaracarya and are known as Mayavadi sannyasis,
whereas the tridandi sannyasis are followers of Vaisnava acaryas--Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya and so
on--and they take trouble to enlighten the householders. Ekadandi sannyasis can be situated on the
platform of pure Brahman because they are aware that the spirit soul is different from the body, but they
are mainly impersonalists. The Vaisnavas know that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person and that
the Brahman effulgence is based on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in the Bhagavadgita
(14.27): brahmano hi pratisthaham. The conclusion is that tirtha-padiya refers to Vaisnavas. In the
Bhagavatam (1.13.10) there is also another reference: tirthi-kurvanti tirthani. Wherever he goes, a
Vaisnava immediately makes that place a tirtha, a place of pilgrimage. The Vaisnava sannyasis travel all
over the world to make every place a place of pilgrimage by the touch of their lotus feet. It is mentioned
here that any house which does not receive a Vaisnava in the manner already explained in the previous
verse is to be considered the residential quarters of venomous serpents. It is said that around the
sandalwood tree, which is a very valuable tree, there is a venomous serpent. Sandalwood is very cold, and
venomous serpents, because of their poisonous teeth, are always very warm, and they take shelter of the
sandalwood trees to become cooler. Similarly, there are many rich men who keep watchdogs or doormen
and put up signs that say, "Do not enter," "Trespassers not allowed," "Beware of the dog," etc. Sometimes
in Western countries a trespasser is shot, and there is no crime in such shooting. This is the position of
demoniac householders, and such houses are considered to be the residential quarters of venomous
snakes. The members of such families are no better than snakes because snakes are very much envious,
and when that envy is directed to the saintly persons, their position becomes more dangerous. It is said by
Canakya Pandita that there are two envious living entities--the snake and the envious man. The envious
man is more dangerous than a snake because a snake can be subdued by charming mantras or by some
herbs, but an envious person cannot be pacified by any means.
