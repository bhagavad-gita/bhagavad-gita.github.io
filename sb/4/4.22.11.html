<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Barhisat--henceforward known as Pracinabarhi--was ordered by the supreme demigod Lord
Brahma to marry the daughter of the ocean named Satadruti. Her bodily features were completely
beautiful, and she was very young. She was decorated with the proper garments, and when she came into
the marriage arena and began circumambulating it, the fire-god Agni became so attracted to her that he
desired her company, exactly as he had formerly desired to enjoy Suki.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word susthv-alankrtam is significant. According to the Vedic system, when a girl is
married, she is very profusely and gorgeously decorated with costly saris and jewelry, and during the
marriage ceremony the bride circumambulates the bridegroom seven times. After this, the bridegroom
and bride look at one another and become attracted for life. When the bridegroom finds the bride very
beautiful, the attraction between them immediately becomes very strongly fixed. As stated in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, men and women are naturally attracted to one another, and when they are united by
marriage that attraction becomes very strong. Being so strongly attracted, the bridegroom attempts to set
up a nice homestead and eventually a good field for producing grains. Then children come, then friends
and then wealth. In this way the male becomes more and more entangled in the material conceptions of
life, and he begins to think, "This is mine," and"it is I who am acting." In this way the illusion of material
existence is perpetuated.
The words sukim iva are also significant, for the fire-god Agni became attracted by the beauty of
Satadruti while she was circumambulating the bridegroom Pracinabarhi, just as he had previously been
attracted to the beauty of Suki, the wife of Saptarsi. When the fire-god had been present long ago at the
assembly of Saptarsi, he was attracted by the beauty of Suki when she was circumambulating in the same
way. Agni's wife, named Svaha, took the form of Suki and enjoyed sex life with Agni. Not only the firegod
Agni but the heavenly god Indra and sometimes even Lord Brahma and Lord Siva--all very highly
situated demigods--are subject to being attracted by sex at any time. The sex drive is so strong in the
living entities that the whole material world is running on sex attraction only, and it is due to sex
attraction that one remains in the material world and is obliged to accept different types of bodies. The
attraction of sex life is more clearly explained in the next verse.
