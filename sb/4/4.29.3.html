<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The person I have described as unknown is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master and eternal
friend of the living entity. Since the living entities cannot realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead by
material names, activities or qualities, He remains everlastingly unknown to the conditioned soul.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unknown to the conditioned soul, He is sometimes
described in Vedic literatures as nirakara, avijnata or avan-manasa-gocara. Actually it is a fact that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be perceived by material senses as far as His form, name, quality,
pastimes or paraphernalia are concerned. However, when one is spiritually advanced, one can understand
the name, form, qualities, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (18.55). Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: one can understand in truth
the Supreme Personality of Godhead only when one is engaged in devotional service. Ordinary persons
engaged in pious and impious activities cannot understand the form, name and activities of the Lord. The
devotee, however, can know the Personality of Godhead in many respects. He can understand that Krsna
is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that His address is Goloka Vrndavana and that His activities are
all spiritual. Because the Lord's form and activities cannot be understood by materialistic people, He is
described by the sastras as nirakara, that is, one whose form cannot be ascertained by a materialistic
person. This does not mean that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no form; it means that it is not
understood by the karmis, or fruitive actors. His form is described in Brahma-samhita as sac-cid-anandavigraha.
As confirmed by the Padma Purana:
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
"No one can understand Krsna as He is by utilizing the blunt material senses. However, the Lord reveals
Himself to His devotees, being pleased with them because of their transcendental loving service rendered
unto Him."
Since the name, form, qualities and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, cannot be
understood by the material senses, He is also called adhoksaja, meaning "beyond sense perception." When
the senses are purified by devotional activity, the devotee understands everything about the Lord by the
Lord's grace. In this verse the words pumbhir namabhir va kriya-gunaih are especially significant because
God, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has many names, activities and qualities, although none
of them are material. Despite the fact that all these names, activities and pastimes are mentioned in the
sastras and understood by the devotees, the karmis (fruitive laborers) cannot understand them. Nor can
the jnanis (mental speculators) understand them. Although there are thousands of names of Lord Visnu,
the karmis and jnanis intermingle the names of the Supreme Godhead with the names of demigods and
human beings. Because they cannot understand the actual name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
they take for granted that any name can be accepted. They believe that since the Absolute Truth is
impersonal, they can call Him by any name. Otherwise, they maintain, He has no name. This is not a fact.
Here it is clearly stated: namabhir va kriya-gunaih. The Lord has specific names such as Rama, Krsna,
Govinda, Narayana, Visnu and Adhoksaja. There are indeed many names, but the conditioned soul cannot
understand them.
