<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by expansion of His eyebrows, invincible time personified can immediately vanquish the entire
universe. However, formidable time does not approach the devotee who has taken complete shelter at
Your lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (10.34) it is said that the Lord in the shape and form of death destroys all a person's
possessions. Mrtyuh sarva-haras caham: "I am all-devouring death." The Lord in the shape of death takes
away everything that is created by the conditioned soul. Everything in this material world is subject to
perish in due course of time. However, all the strength of time cannot hamper the activities of a devotee,
for a devotee takes complete shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord. For this reason only is a devotee free
from formidable time. All the activities of the karmis and jnanis, which have no touch of devotional
service, are spoiled in due course of time. The material success of the karmis is destined to be destroyed;
similarly, the impersonal realization attained by the jnanis is also destroyed in the course of time.
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
(Bhag. 10.2.32)
To say nothing of the karmis, the jnanis undergo severe austerities to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti,
but because they do not find the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down again into this material existence.
Unless one is fully situated in unalloyed devotional service, there is no guarantee of liberation, even if one
is elevated to the heavenly planets or to the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee's achievement,
however, is never lost by the influence of time. Even if a devotee cannot completely execute devotional
service, in his next life he begins from the point where he left off. Such an opportunity is not given to the
karmis and jnanis, whose achievements are destroyed. The bhakta's achievement is never destroyed, for it
goes on perpetually, be it complete or incomplete. This is the verdict of all Vedic literatures. Sucinam
srimatam gehe yoga-bhrasto'bhijayate. If one is unable to complete the process of bhakti-yoga, he is given
a chance in his next life to take birth in a pure family of devotees or in a rich family. In such families a
person can have a good opportunity to further progress in devotional service.
When Yamaraja, the superintendent of death, was instructing his assistants, he told them not to
approach the devotees. "The devotees should be offered respect," he said, "but do not go near them."
Thus the devotees of the Lord are not under the jurisdiction of Yamaraja. Yamaraja is a representative of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he controls the death of every living entity. Yet he has nothing
to do with the devotees. Simply by blinking his eyes, time personified can destroy the entire cosmic
manifestation, but he has nothing to do with the devotee. In other words, devotional service which is
rendered by the devotee in this lifetime can never be destroyed by time. Such spiritual assets remain
unchanged, being beyond the influence of time.
