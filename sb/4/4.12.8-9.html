<h2>Translation</h2>
By expansion of his knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, he had already attained liberation from the
bondage of the body. This liberation is known as nirvana. He was situated in transcendental bliss, and he
continued always in that blissful existence, which expanded more and more. This was possible for him by
continual practice of bhakti-yoga, which is compared to fire because it burns away all dirty, material
things. He was always situated in his constitutional position of self-realization, and he could not see
anything else but the Supreme Lord and himself engaged in discharging devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These two verses explain the verse in the Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments nor desires to have anything. He is equally disposed towards every living entity. In that
state he achieves pure devotional service unto Me." This is also explained by Lord Caitanya in His
Siksastaka in the beginning of the first verse:
ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam
sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam
The bhakti-yoga system is the topmost yoga system, and in this system the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord is the foremost performance of devotional service. By chanting the holy name one can attain the
perfection of nirvana, or liberation from material existence, and so increase one's blissful life of spiritual
existence as described by Lord Caitanya (anandambudhi-vardhanam). When one is situated in that
position, he no longer has any interest in material opulence or even a royal throne and sovereignty over
the whole planet. This situation is called viraktir anyatra syat. It is the result of devotional service.
The more one makes advancement in devotional service, the more one becomes detached from material
opulence and material activity. This is the spiritual nature, full of bliss. This is also described in Bhagavadgita
(2.59). Param drstva nivartate: one ceases to take part in material enjoyment upon tasting superior,
blissful life in spiritual existence. By advancement in spiritual knowledge, which is considered to be like
blazing fire, all material desires are burned to ashes. The perfection of mystic yoga is possible when one is
continuously in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by discharging devotional service.
A devotee is always thinking of the Supreme Person at every step of his life. Every conditioned soul is full
of the reactions of his past life, but all dirty things are immediately burned to ashes if one simply executes
devotional service. This is described in the Narada-pancaratra: sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena
nirmalam.
