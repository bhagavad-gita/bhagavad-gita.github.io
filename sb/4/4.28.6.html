<h2>Text</h2>
yad adistam bhagavata
sivenadhoksajena ca
tad grhesu prasaktanam
prayasah ksapitam prabho
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--what; adistam--was instructed; bhagavata--by the exalted personality; sivena--Lord Siva;
adhoksajena--by Lord Visnu; ca--also; tat--that; grhesu--to family affairs; prasaktanam--by us who were
too much attached; prayasah--almost; ksapitam--forgotten; prabho--O master.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O master, may we inform you that because of our being overly attached to family affairs, we almost
forgot the instructions we received from Lord Siva and Lord Visnu.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Remaining in family life is a kind of concession for sense enjoyment. One should know that sense
enjoyment is not required, but one has to accept sense enjoyment inasmuch as one has to live. As
confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.10): kamasya nendriya-pritih. One has to become a gosvami and
control his senses. One should not simply use his senses for sense gratification; rather, the senses should
be employed just as much as required for maintaining body and soul together. Srila Rupa Gosvami
recommends: anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah. One should not be attached to sense objects,
but should accept sense enjoyment as much as required, no more. If one wishes to enjoy the senses more
than required, he becomes attached to family life, which means bondage. All the Pracetas admitted their
fault in remaining in household life.
