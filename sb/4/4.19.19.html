<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavan atha visvatma
prthunopahrtarhanah
samujjihanaya bhaktya
grhita-caranambujah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; atha--thereupon; visva-atma--the Supersoul; prthuna--
by King Prthu; upahrta--being offered; arhanah--all the paraphernalia for worship; samujjihanaya--
gradually increased; bhaktya--whose devotional service; grhita--taken; carana-ambujah--His lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Prthu abundantly worshiped the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was so
merciful to him. While worshiping the lotus feet of the Lord, Prthu Maharaja gradually increased his
ecstasy in devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When various ecstasies appear in the body of a devotee, it is to be understood that his devotional service
has become perfect. There are many types of transcendental ecstasies in the forms of crying, laughing,
perspiring, falling down, and crying like a madman. All these symptoms are sometimes visible on the
body of a devotee. They are called asta-sattvika-vikara, which means "eight kinds of transcendental
transformations." They are never to be imitated, but when a devotee actually becomes perfect, these
symptoms are visible on his body. The Lord is bhakta-vatsala, which means that He is inclined toward His
pure devotee (bhakta). Therefore the transcendental ecstatic transaction between the Supreme Lord and
His devotee is never like the activities of this material world.
