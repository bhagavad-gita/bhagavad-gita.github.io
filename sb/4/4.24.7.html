<h2>Text</h2>
duhitrr dasottara-satam
pitr-matr-yasaskarih
silaudarya-gunopetah
pauranjanyah praja-pate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
duhitrh--daughters; dasa-uttara--ten more than; satam--one hundred; pitr--like the father; matr--and
mother; yasaskarih--glorified; sila--good behavior; audarya--magnanimity; guna--good qualities; upetah--
possessed of; pauranjanyah--daughters of Puranjana; praja-pate--O Prajapati.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Prajapati, King Pracinabarhisat, in this way King Puranjana also begot 110 daughters. All of these
were equally glorified like the father and mother. Their behavior was gentle, and they possessed
magnanimity and other good qualities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Children begotten under the rules and regulations of the scriptures generally become as good as the
father and mother, but children born illegitimately mainly become varna-sankara. The varna-sankara
population is irresponsible to the family, community and even to themselves. Formerly the varna-sankara
population was checked by the observation of the reformatory method called garbhadhana-samskara, a
child-begetting religious ceremony. In this verse we find that although King Puranjana had begotten so
many children, they were not varna-sankara. All of them were good, well-behaved children, and they had
good qualities like their father and mother.
Even though we may produce many good children, our desire for sex that is beyond the prescribed
method is to be considered sinful. Too much enjoyment of any of the senses (not only sex) results in
sinful activities. Therefore one has to become a svami or gosvami at the end of his life. One may beget
children up to the age of fifty, but after fifty, one must stop begetting children and should accept the
vanaprastha order. In this way he must leave home and then become a sannyasi. A sannyasi's title is svami
or gosvami, which means that he completely refrains from sense enjoyment. One should not accept the
sannyasa order whimsically; he must be fully confident that he can restrain his desires for sense
gratification. King Puranjana's family life was, of course, very happy. As mentioned in these verses, he
begot 1,100 sons and 110 daughters. Everyone desires to have more sons than daughters, and since the
number of daughters was less than the number of sons, it appears that King Puranjana's family life was
very comfortable and pleasing.
