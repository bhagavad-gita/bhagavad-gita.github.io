<h2>Text</h2>
sa vancito batatma-dhruk
krcchrena mahata bhuvi
labdhvapavargyam manusyam
visayesu visajjate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; vancitah--cheated; bata--certainly; atma-dhruk--envious of himself; krcchrena--with great
difficulty; mahata--by great activities; bhuvi--in this world; labdhva--by achieving; apavargyam--the path
of liberation; manusyam--in the human form of life; visayesu--in the matter of sense gratification;
visajjate--becomes engaged.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Any person who engages himself within this material world in performing activities that necessitate
great struggle, and who, after obtaining a human form of life--which is a chance to attain liberation from
miseries--undertakes the difficult tasks of fruitive activities, must be considered to be cheated and envious
of his own self.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this material world people are engaged in different activities simply to achieve a little success in sense
gratification. The karmis are engaged in performing very difficult activities, and thus they open gigantic
factories, build huge cities, make big scientific discoveries, etc. In other words, they are engaged in
performing very costly sacrifices in order to be promoted to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, yogis
are engaged in achieving a similar goal by accepting the tedious practices of mystic yoga. Jnanis are
engaged in philosophical speculation in order to gain release from the clutches of material nature. In these
ways everyone is engaged in performing very difficult tasks simply for the gratification of the senses. All of
these are considered to be engaged in sense gratificatory activities (or visaya) because they all demand
some facility for material existence. Actually the results of such activities are temporary. As Krsna Himself
proclaims in Bhagavad-gita (7.23), antavat tu phalam tesam: "The fruits [of those who worship the
demigods] are limited and temporary." Thus the fruits of the activities of the yogis, karmis and jnanis are
ephemeral. Moreover, Krsna says, tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: "They are simply meant for men of small
intelligence." The word visaya denotes sense gratification. The karmis flatly state that they want sense
gratification. The yogis also want sense gratification, but they want it to a higher degree. It is their desire
to show some miraculous results through the practice of yoga. Thus they strive very hard to achieve
success in becoming smaller than the smallest or greater than the greatest, or in creating a planet like
earth or, as scientists, by inventing so many wonderful machines. Similarly, the jnanis are also engaged in
sense gratification, for they are simply interested in becoming one with the Supreme. Thus the aim of all
these activities is sense gratification to a higher or a lower degree. The bhaktas, however, are not
interested in sense gratificatory practices; they are simply satisfied to get an opportunity to serve the Lord.
Although they are satisfied in any condition, there is nothing they cannot obtain, because they are purely
engaged in the service of the Lord.
The wives of the demigods condemn the performers of sense gratificatory activities as vancita, cheated.
Those so engaged are actually killing themselves (atma-ha). As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.20.17):
nr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham
plavam sukalpam guru-karnadharam
mayanukulena nabhasvateritam
puman bhavabdhim na taret sa atma-ha
When one wants to cross a large ocean, he requires a strong boat. It is said that this human form of life
is a good boat by which one can cross the ocean of nescience. In the human form of life one can obtain
the guidance of a good navigator, the spiritual master. One also gets a favorable wind by the mercy of
Krsna, and that wind is the instructions of Krsna. The human body is the boat, the instructions of Lord
Krsna are the favorable winds, and the spiritual master is the navigator. The spiritual master knows well
how to adjust the sails to catch the winds favorably and steer the boat to its destination. If, however, one
does not take advantage of this opportunity, one wastes the human form of life. Wasting time and life in
this way is the same as committing suicide.
The word labdhvapavargyam is significant in this verse, because according to Jiva Gosvami,
apavargyam, or the path of liberation, does not refer to merging into the impersonal Brahman but to
salokyadi-siddhi, which means attaining the very planet where the Supreme Personality of Godhead
resides. There are five kinds of liberation, and one is called sayujya-mukti, or merging into the existence
of the Supreme, or the impersonal Brahman effulgence. However, since there is a chance of one's falling
down again into the material sky from the Brahman effulgence, Srila Jiva Gosvami advises that in this
human form of life one's only aim should be to go back home, back to Godhead. The words sa vancitah
indicate that once a person has obtained the human form of life, he is actually cheated if he does not make
preparations to go back home, back to Godhead. The position of all nondevotees, who are not interested
in going back to Godhead, is very much lamentable, for the human form of life is meant for executing
devotional service and nothing else.
