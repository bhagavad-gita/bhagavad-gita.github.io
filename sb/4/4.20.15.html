<h2>Text</h2>
pramsuh pinayata-bhujo
gaurah kanjaruneksanah
sunasah sumukhah saumyah
pinamsah sudvija-smitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pramsuh--very tall; pina-ayata--full and broad; bhujah--arms; gaurah--fair-complexioned; kanja--
lotuslike; aruna-iksanah--with bright eyes resembling a morning sunrise; su-nasah--straight nose; sumukhah--
with a beautiful face; saumyah--of a grave bodily stature; pina-amsah--shoulders raised; su--
beautiful; dvija--teeth; smitah--smiling.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Prthu's body was tall and sturdy, and his complexion was fair. His arms were full and broad and
his eyes as bright as the rising sun. His nose was straight, his face very beautiful and his personality grave.
His teeth were set beautifully in his smiling face.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Amongst the four social orders (brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras), the ksatriyas, both men and
women, are generally very beautiful. As will be apparent from the following verses, it is to be concluded
that not only were Maharaja Prthu's bodily features attractive, as described here, but he had specific allauspicious
signs in his bodily construction.
As it is said, "The face is the index of the mind." One's mental constitution is exhibited by his facial
features. The bodily features of a particular person are exhibited in accordance with his past deeds, for
according to one's past deeds, his next bodily features--whether in human society, animal society or
demigod society--are determined. This is proof of the transmigration of the soul through different types of
bodies.
