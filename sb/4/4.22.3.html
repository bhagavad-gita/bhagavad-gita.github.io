<h2>Text</h2>
antardhana-gatim sakral
labdhvantardhana-samjnitah
apatya-trayam adhatta
sikhandinyam susammatam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
antardhana--of disappearance; gatim--achievement; sakrat--from King Indra; labdhva--getting;
antardhana--of the name; samjnitah--so nominated; apatya--children; trayam--three; adhatta--begot;
sikhandinyam--in Sikhandini, his wife; su-sammatam--approved by everyone.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Formerly, Maharaja Vijitasva pleased the King of heaven, Indra, and from him received the title
Antardhana. His wife's name was Sikhandini, and by her he begot three good sons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Vijitasva was known as Antardhana, which means "disappearance." He received this title from
Indra, and it refers to the time when Indra stole Maharaja Prthu's horse from the sacrificial arena. Indra
was not visible to others when he was stealing the horse, but Maharaja Prthu's son Vijitasva could see
him. Yet despite his knowing that Indra was taking away his father's horse, Vijitasva did not attack him.
This indicates that Maharaja Vijitasva respected the right persons. Although Indra was stealing the horse
from his father, Vijitasva knew perfectly well that Indra was not an ordinary thief. Since Indra was a great
and powerful demigod and servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vijitasva purposefully excused
him due to sentiment only, even though Indra was acting wrongly. Thus Indra became very pleased with
Vijitasva at that time. The demigods have the great mystic power of being able to appear and disappear
according to their will, and since Indra was very pleased with Vijitasva, he bestowed this mystic power
upon him. Thus Vijitasva became known as Antardhana.
