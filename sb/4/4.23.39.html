<h2>Translation</h2>
The woman continued: In this material world, a householder's life brings all kinds of happiness in
religion, economic development, sense gratification and the begetting of children, sons and grandsons.
After that, one may desire liberation as well as material reputation. The householder can appreciate the
results of sacrifices, which enable him to gain promotion to superior planetary systems. All this material
happiness is practically unknown to the transcendentalists. They cannot even imagine such happiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic instructions, there are two paths for human activities. One is called pravrtti-marga,
and the other is called nivrtti-marga. The basic principle for either of these paths is religious life. In
animal life there is only pravrtti-marga. pravrtti-marga means sense enjoyment, and nivrtti-marga means
spiritual advancement. In the life of animals and demons, there is no conception of nivrtti-marga, nor is
there any actual conception of pravrtti-marga. pravrtti-marga maintains that even though one has the
propensity for sense gratification, he can gratify his senses according to the directions of the Vedic
injunctions. For example, everyone has the propensity for sex life, but in demoniac civilization sex is
enjoyed without restriction. According to Vedic culture, sex is enjoyed under Vedic instructions. Thus the
Vedas give direction to civilized human beings to enable them to satisfy their propensities for sense
gratification.
In the nivrtti-marga, however, on the path of transcendental realization, sex is completely forbidden.
The social orders are divided into four parts--brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa--and only
in the householder life can the pravrtti-marga be encouraged or accepted according to Vedic instructions.
In the orders of brahmacarya, vanaprastha and sannyasa, there are no facilities for sex.
In this verse the woman is advocating pravrtti-marga only and is discouraging the path of nivrtti-marga.
She clearly says that the yatis, the transcendentalists, who are concerned only with spiritual life
(kaivalya), cannot imagine the happiness of pravrtti-marga. In other words, the man who follows the
Vedic principles enjoys the materialistic way of life not only by becoming happy in this life, but also in the
next life by being promoted to the heavenly planets. In this life such a person gets all kinds of material
opulences, such as sons and grandsons, because he is always engaged in various religious functions. The
material distresses are birth, old age, disease and death, but those who are interested in pravrtti-marga
hold various religious functions at the time of birth, old age, disease and death. Without caring for the
distresses of birth, old age, disease and death, they are addicted to performing the special functions
according to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.
Factually, however, pravrtti-marga is based on sex life. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.9.45), yan
maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. A householder who is too much addicted to pravrtti-marga is
actually called a grhamedhi, not a grhastha. Although the grhastha desires sense gratification, he acts
according to Vedic instructions. The grhamedhi, however, who is interested only in sense gratification,
does not follow any Vedic instruction. The grhamedhi engages himself as an advocate of sex life and also
allows his sons and daughters to engage in sex and to be deprived of any glorious end in life. A grhastha
enjoys sex life in this life as well as in the next, but a grhamedhi does not know what the next life is about
because he is simply interested in sex in this life. On the whole, when one is too much inclined toward
sex, he does not care for the transcendental spiritual life. In this age of Kali especially, no one is interested
in spiritual advancement. Even though it is sometimes found that one may be interested in spiritual
advancement, he is most likely to accept a bogus method of spiritual life, being misguided by so many
pretenders.
