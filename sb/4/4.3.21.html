<h2>Translation</h2>
One who is conducted by false ego and thus always distressed, both mentally and sensually, cannot
tolerate the opulence of self-realized persons. Being unable to rise to the standard of self-realization, he
envies such persons as much as demons envy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The real reason for the enmity between Lord Siva and Daksa is explained here. Daksa was envious of
Lord Siva because of Siva's high position as an incarnation of a quality of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and because Siva was directly in contact with the Supersoul and was therefore honored and
given a better sitting place than he. There were many other reasons also. Daksa, being materially puffed
up, could not tolerate the high position of Lord Siva, so his anger at Lord Siva's not standing up in his
presence was only the final manifestation of his envy. Lord Siva is always in meditation and always
perceives the Supersoul, as expressed here by the words purusa-buddhi-saksinam. The position of one
whose intelligence is always absorbed in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very
great and cannot be imitated by anyone, especially an ordinary person. When Daksa entered the arena of
yajna, Lord Siva was in meditation and might not have seen Daksa enter, but Daksa took the opportunity
to curse him because Daksa had maintained an envious attitude towards Lord Siva for a long time. Those
who are actually self-realized see every individual body as a temple of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead because the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His Paramatma feature, is residing in
everyone's body.
When one offers respect to the body, it is not to the material body but to the presence of the Supreme
Lord. Thus one who is always in meditation upon the Supreme Lord is always offering Him obeisances.
But since Daksa was not very elevated, he thought that obeisances were offered to the material body, and
because Lord Siva did not offer respect to his material body, Daksa became envious. Such persons, being
unable to rise to the standard of self-realized souls like Lord Siva, are always envious. The example given
here is very suitable. Asuras, demons or atheists, are always envious of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; they simply want to kill Him. Even in this age we find some so-called scholars commenting on
Bhagavad-gita who are envious of Krsna. When Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhaktah (Bg.
18.65)--"Always think of Me, become My devotee, and surrender unto Me"--the so-called scholars
comment that it is not to Krsna that we have to surrender. That is envy. The asuras or atheists, the
demons, without reason or cause, are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, instead
of offering respect to self-realized persons, foolish men who cannot approach the highest standard of selfrealization
are always envious, although there is no reason.
