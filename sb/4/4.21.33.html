<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
trih krtva idam akarnya
naro nary athavadrta
aprajah suprajatamo
nirdhano dhanavattamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
trih--thrice; krtvah--repeating; idam--this; akarnya--hearing; narah--man; nari--woman; athava--or;
adrta--in great respect; aprajah--one who has no children; su-praja-tamah--surrounded by many children;
nirdhanah--without any money; dhana-vat--rich; tamah--the greatest.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It does not matter whether one is a man or woman. Anyone who, with great respect, hears this narration
of Maharaja Prthu will become the father of many children if he is without children and will become the
richest of men if he is without money.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialistic persons who are very fond of money and great families worship different demigods to
attain their desires, especially goddess Durga, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma. Such materialistic persons are
called sriyaisvarya-prajepsavah. Sri means "beauty," aisvarya means "riches," praja means "children," and
ipsavah means "desiring." As described in the Second Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, one has to worship
various demigods for different types of benedictions. However, here it is indicated that simply by hearing
of the life and character of Maharaja Prthu, one can have both riches and children in enormous quantities.
One simply has to read and understand the history, the life and activities of Prthu Maharaja. It is advised
that one read them at least three times. Those who are materially afflicted will so benefit by hearing of the
Supreme Lord and His devotees that they need not go to any demigod. The word suprajatamah
("surrounded by many children") is very significant in this verse, for one may have many children but
may not have any qualified children. Here, however, it is stated (su-prajatamah) that all the children thus
attained would be qualified in education, wealth, beauty and strength--everything complete.
