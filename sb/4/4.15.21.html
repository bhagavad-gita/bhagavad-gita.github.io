<h2>Text</h2>
asmai nr-palah kila tatra tatra
balim harisyanti saloka-palah
mamsyanta esam striya adi-rajam
cakrayudham tad-yasa uddharantyah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asmai--unto him; nr-palah--all the kings; kila--certainly; tatra tatra--here and there; balim--
presentations; harisyanti--will offer; sa--with; loka-palah--the demigods; mamsyante--will consider; esam--
of these kings; striyah--wives; adi-rajam--the original king; cakra-ayudham--bearing the disc weapon; tat--
his; yasah--reputation; uddharantyah--carrying on.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the King travels all over the world, other kings, as well as the demigods, will offer him all kinds
of presentations. Their queens will also consider him the original king, who carries in His hands the
emblems of club and disc, and will sing of his fame, for he will be as reputable as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As far as reputation is concerned, King Prthu is already known as the incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The word adi-rajam means "the original king." The original king is Narayana, or
Lord Visnu. People do not know that the original king, or Narayana, is actually the protector of all living
entities. As confirmed in the Vedas: eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman (Katha Upanisad 2.2.13). Actually
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is maintaining all living entities. The king, or naradeva, is His
representative. As such, the king's duty is to personally supervise the distribution of wealth for the
maintenance of all living entities. If he does so, he will be as reputable as Narayana. As mentioned in this
verse (tad-yasah), Prthu Maharaja was actually carrying with him the reputation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because he was actually reigning over the world in that capacity.
