<h2>Text</h2>
amusam ksut-paritanam
artanam paridevitam
samayisyami mad-banair
bhinnayas tava medasa
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
amusam--of all of them; ksut-paritanam--suffering from hunger; artanam--of the distressed;
paridevitam--the lamentation; samayisyami--I shall pacify; mat-banaih--by my arrows; bhinnayah--being
cut to pieces; tava--of you; medasa--by the flesh.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Now, with the help of my arrows, I shall cut you to pieces and with your flesh satisfy the hungerstricken
citizens, who are now crying for want of grains. Thus I shall satisfy the crying citizens of my
kingdom.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here we find some indication of how the government can arrange for the eating of cow flesh. It is here
indicated that in a rare circumstance when there is no supply of grains, the government may sanction the
eating of meat. However, when there is sufficient food, the government should not allow the eating of
cow's flesh just to satisfy the fastidious tongue. In other words, in rare circumstances, when people are
suffering for want of grains, meat-eating or flesh-eating can be allowed, but not otherwise. The
maintenance of slaughterhouses for the satisfaction of the tongue and the killing of animals unnecessarily
should never be sanctioned by a government.
As described in a previous verse, cows and other animals should be given sufficient grass to eat. If
despite a sufficient supply of grass a cow does not supply milk, and if there is an acute shortage of food,
the dried-up cow may be utilized to feed the hungry masses of people. According to the law of necessity,
first of all human society must try to produce food grains and vegetables, but if they fail in this, they can
indulge in flesh-eating. Otherwise not. As human society is presently structured, there is sufficient
production of grains all over the world. Therefore the opening of slaughterhouses cannot be supported. In
some nations there is so much surplus grain that sometimes extra grain is thrown into the sea, and
sometimes the government forbids further production of grain. The conclusion is that the earth produces
sufficient grain to feed the entire population, but the distribution of this grain is restricted due to trade
regulations and a desire for profit. Consequently in some places there is scarcity of grain and in others
profuse production. If there were one government on the surface of the earth to handle the distribution of
grain, there would be no question of scarcity, no necessity to open slaughterhouses, and no need to
present false theories about over-population.
