<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, whatever you have asked from me about the great

and devotees very much like to hear about Dhruva Maharaja.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srimad-Bhagavatam means everything in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Whether we hear the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Lord or we hear about the character,
reputation and activities of His devotees, they are all one and the same. Neophyte devotees simply try to
understand the pastimes of the Lord and are not very interested in hearing about the activities of His
devotees, but such discrimination should not be indulged in by any real devotee. Sometimes less
intelligent men try to hear about the rasa dance of Krsna and do not take care to hear about other portions
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, which they completely avoid. There are professional Bhagavata reciters who
abruptly go to the rasa-lila chapters of Srimad-Bhagavatam, as if other portions of Srimad-Bhagavatam
were useless. This kind of discrimination and abrupt adoption of the rasa-lila pastimes of the Lord is not
approved by the acaryas. A sincere devotee should read every chapter and every word of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, for the beginning verses describe that it is the ripened fruit of all Vedic literature. Devotees
should not try to avoid even a word of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The great sage Maitreya therefore affirmed
herein that the Bhagavatam is sammatam satam, approved by great devotees.
