<h2>Text</h2>
vipralabdho mahisyaivam
sarva-prakrti-vancitah
necchann anukaroty ajnah
klaibyat krida-mrgo yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vipralabdhah--captivated; mahisya--by the Queen; evam--thus; sarva--all; prakrti--existence; vancitah--
being cheated; na icchan--without desiring; anukaroti--used to follow and imitate; ajnah--the foolish King;
klaibyat--by force; krida-mrgah--a pet animal; yatha--just like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way, King Puranjana was captivated by his nice wife and was thus cheated. Indeed, he became
cheated in his whole existence in the material world. Even against that poor foolish King's desire, he
remained under the control of his wife, just like a pet animal that dances according to the order of its
master.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word vipralabdhah is very significant in this verse. Vi means "specifically," and pralabdha means
"obtained." Just to satisfy his desires, the King got the Queen, and thus he became cheated by material
existence. Although he was not willing to do so, he remained a pet animal under the control of material
intelligence. Just as a pet monkey dances according to the desires of its master, the King danced according
to the desires of the Queen. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) it is said, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh:
if one associates with a saintly person, a devotee, one's path of liberation becomes clear. But if one
associates with a woman or with a person who is too much addicted to a woman, his path of bondage
becomes completely clear.
On the whole, for spiritual advancement, one must give up the company of women. This is what is
meant by the order of sannyasa, the renounced order. Before taking sannyasa, or completely renouncing
the material world, one has to practice avoiding illicit sex. Sex life, licit or illicit, is practically the same,
but through illicit sex one becomes more and more captivated. By regulating one's sex life there is a
chance that one may eventually be able to renounce sex or renounce the association of women. If this can
be done, advancement in spiritual life comes very easily.
How one becomes captivated by the association of one's dear wife is explained in this chapter by Narada
Muni. Attraction for one's wife means attraction for the material qualities. One who is attracted by the
material quality of darkness is in the lowest stage of life, whereas one who is attracted by the material
quality of goodness is in a better position. Sometimes we see that when a person is on the platform of
material goodness, he is attracted more or less by the cultivation of knowledge. This is, of course, a better
position, for knowledge gives one the preference to accept devotional service. Unless one comes to the
platform of knowledge, the brahma-bhuta stage, one cannot advance in devotional service. As Krsna says
in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully
joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that
state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."
The platform of knowledge is advantageous because it is a means by which one may come to the stage of
devotional service. However, if one takes to devotional service directly, knowledge is revealed without
separate endeavor. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
Devotional service automatically reveals actual knowledge of our material existence. One who is
sufficiently intelligent immediately attains the stage of renunciation of so-called society, family and love as
well as other things. As long as we are attached to society, family and love of the material world, there is
no question of knowledge. Nor is there a question of devotional service. By directly taking to devotional
service, however, one becomes filled with knowledge and renunciation. In this way one's life becomes
successful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Descriptions of the Characteristics of King Puranjana."
Chapter Twenty-six
King Puranjana Goes to the Forest to Hunt, and His Queen Becomes Angry
