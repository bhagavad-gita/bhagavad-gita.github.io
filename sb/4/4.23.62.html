vipralabdho mahisyaivam
sarva-prakrti-vancitah
necchann anukaroty ajnah
klaibyat krida-mrgo yatha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vipralabdhah--captivated; mahisya--by the Queen; evam--thus; sarva--all; prakrti--existence; vancitah--
being cheated; na icchan--without desiring; anukaroti--used to follow and imitate; ajnah--the foolish King;
klaibyat--by force; krida-mrgah--a pet animal; yatha--just like.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way, King Puranjana was captivated by his nice wife and was thus cheated. Indeed, he became
cheated in his whole existence in the material world. Even against that poor foolish King's desire, he
remained under the control of his wife, just like a pet animal that dances according to the order of its
master.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word vipralabdhah is very significant in this verse. Vi means "specifically," and pralabdha means
"obtained." Just to satisfy his desires, the King got the Queen, and thus he became cheated by material
existence. Although he was not willing to do so, he remained a pet animal under the control of material
intelligence. Just as a pet monkey dances according to the desires of its master, the King danced according
to the desires of the Queen. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) it is said, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh:
if one associates with a saintly person, a devotee, one's path of liberation becomes clear. But if one
associates with a woman or with a person who is too much addicted to a woman, his path of bondage
becomes completely clear.
On the whole, for spiritual advancement, one must give up the company of women. This is what is
meant by the order of sannyasa, the renounced order. Before taking sannyasa, or completely renouncing
the material world, one has to practice avoiding illicit sex. Sex life, licit or illicit, is practically the same,
but through illicit sex one becomes more and more captivated. By regulating one's sex life there is a
chance that one may eventually be able to renounce sex or renounce the association of women. If this can
be done, advancement in spiritual life comes very easily.
How one becomes captivated by the association of one's dear wife is explained in this chapter by Narada
Muni. Attraction for one's wife means attraction for the material qualities. One who is attracted by the
material quality of darkness is in the lowest stage of life, whereas one who is attracted by the material
quality of goodness is in a better position. Sometimes we see that when a person is on the platform of
material goodness, he is attracted more or less by the cultivation of knowledge. This is, of course, a better
position, for knowledge gives one the preference to accept devotional service. Unless one comes to the
platform of knowledge, the brahma-bhuta stage, one cannot advance in devotional service. As Krsna says
in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully
joyful. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that
state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."
The platform of knowledge is advantageous because it is a means by which one may come to the stage of
devotional service. However, if one takes to devotional service directly, knowledge is revealed without
separate endeavor. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
Devotional service automatically reveals actual knowledge of our material existence. One who is
sufficiently intelligent immediately attains the stage of renunciation of so-called society, family and love as
well as other things. As long as we are attached to society, family and love of the material world, there is
no question of knowledge. Nor is there a question of devotional service. By directly taking to devotional
service, however, one becomes filled with knowledge and renunciation. In this way one's life becomes
successful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Fourth Canto, Twenty-fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Descriptions of the Characteristics of King Puranjana."

<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King, once upon a time King Puranjana took up his great
bow, and equipped with golden armor and a quiver of unlimited arrows and accompanied by eleven
commanders, he sat on his chariot driven by five swift horses and went to the forest named Panca-prastha.
He took with him in that chariot two explosive arrows. The chariot itself was situated on two wheels and
one revolving axle. On the chariot were three flags, one rein, one chariot driver, one sitting place, two
poles to which the harness was fixed, five weapons and seven coverings. The chariot moved in five
different styles, and five obstacles lay before it. All the decorations of the chariot were made of gold.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These three verses explain how the material body of the living entity is under the control of the three
qualities of the external energy. The body itself is the chariot, and the living entity is the owner of the
body, as explained in Bhagavad-gita (2.13): dehino 'smin yatha dehe. The owner of the body is called the
dehi, and he is situated within this body, specifically within the heart. The living entity is driven by one
chariot driver. The chariot itself is made of three gunas, three qualities of material nature, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (18.61): yantrarudhani mayaya. The word yantra means "carriage." The body is given by
material nature, and the driver of that body is Paramatma, the Supersoul. The living entity is seated within
the chariot. This is the actual position.
The living entity is always being influenced by the three qualities--sattva (goodness), rajas (passion) and
tamas (ignorance). This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.13). Tribhir gunamayair bhavaih: the living
entity is bewildered by the three qualities of material nature. These three qualities are described in this
verse as three flags. By a flag, one can come to know who the owner of the chariot is; similarly, by the
influence of the three qualities of material nature, one can easily know the direction in which the chariot
is moving. In other words, one who has eyes to see can understand how the body is being driven,
influenced by the particular type of quality of material nature. In these three verses the activity of the
living entity is described to prove how the body becomes influenced by the quality of ignorance, even
when a person wants to be religious. Narada Muni wanted to prove to King Pracinabarhisat that the King
was being influenced by the tamo-guna, the quality of ignorance, even though the King was supposed to
be very religious.
According to karma-kandiya, the process of fruitive activities, a person performs various sacrifices
directed by the Vedas, and in all those sacrifices animal-killing, or experimenting on the life of animals to
test the power of Vedic mantras, is enjoined. Animal-killing is certainly conducted under the influence of
the mode of ignorance. Even though one may be religiously inclined, animal sacrifice is recommended in
the sastras, not only in the Vedas but even in the modern scriptures of other sects. These animal sacrifices
are recommended in the name of religion, but actually animal sacrifice is meant for persons in the mode
of ignorance. When such people kill animals, they can at least do so in the name of religion. However,
when the religious system is transcendental, like the Vaisnava religion, there is no place for animal
sacrifice. Such a transcendental religious system is recommended by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." Because King Pracinabarhisat was engaged in performing various sacrifices in which animals
were killed, Narada Muni pointed out that such sacrifices are influenced by the mode of ignorance. From
the very beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.2) it is said: projjhita-kaitavo 'tra. All kinds of religious
systems that are involved in cheating are completely kicked out of Srimad-Bhagavatam. In the bhagavaddharma,
the religion dealing with one's relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, animal
sacrifice is not recommended. In the performance of sankirtana-yajna--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna
Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--there is no recommendation for
animal sacrifices.
In these three verses, King Puranjana's going to the forest to kill animals is symbolic of the living entity's
being driven by the mode of ignorance and thus engaging in different activities for sense gratification. The
material body itself indicates that the living entity is already influenced by the three modes of material
nature and that he is driven to enjoy material resources. When the body is influenced by the mode of
ignorance, its infection becomes very acute. When it is influenced by the mode of passion, the infection is
at the symptomatic stage. However, when the body is influenced by the mode of goodness, the
materialistic infection becomes purified. The ritualistic ceremonies recommended in religious systems are
certainly on the platform of goodness, but because within this material world even the mode of goodness
is sometimes polluted by the other qualities (namely passion and ignorance), a man in goodness is
sometimes driven by the influence of ignorance.
It is herein described that King Puranjana once went to the forest to kill animals. This means that he,
the living entity, came under the influence of the mode of ignorance. The forest in which King Puranjana
engaged in hunting was named Panca-prastha. The word panca means "five," and this indicates the
objects of the five senses. The body has five working senses, namely the hands, the legs, the tongue, the
rectum and the genitals. By taking full advantage of these working senses, the body enjoys material life.
The chariot is driven by five horses, which represent the five sense organs--namely the eyes, ears, nose,
skin and tongue. These sense organs are very easily attracted by the sense objects. Consequently, the
horses are described as moving swiftly. On the chariot King Puranjana kept two explosive weapons, which
may be compared to ahankara, or false ego. This false ego is typified by two attitudes: "I am this body"
(ahanta), and "Everything in my bodily relationships belongs to me" (mamata).
The two wheels of the chariot may be compared to the two moving facilities--namely sinful life and
religious life. The chariot is decorated with three flags, which represent the three modes of material
nature. The five kinds of obstacles, or uneven roads, represent the five kinds of air passing within the
body. These are prana, apana, udana, samana and vyana. The body itself is covered by seven coverings,
namely skin, muscle, fat, blood, marrow, bone and semen. The living entity is covered by three subtle
material elements and five gross material elements. These are actually obstacles placed before the living
entity on the path of liberation from material bondage.
The word rasmi ("rope") in this verse indicates the mind. The word nida is also significant, for nida
indicates the nest where a bird takes rest. In this case nida is the heart, where the living entity is situated.
The living entity sits in one place only. The causes of his bondage are two: namely lamentation and
illusion. In material existence the living entity simply hankers to get something he can never get.
Therefore he is in illusion. As a result of being in this illusory situation, the living entity is always
lamenting. Thus lamentation and illusion are described herein as dvi-kubara, the two posts of bondage.
The living entity carries out various desires through five different processes, which indicate the working
of the five working senses. The golden ornaments and dress indicate that the living entity is influenced by
the quality of rajo-guna, passion. One who has a good deal of money or riches is especially driven by the
mode of passion. Being influenced by the mode of passion, one desires so many things for enjoyment in
this material world. The eleven commanders represent the ten senses and the mind. The mind is always
making plans with the ten commanders to enjoy the material world. The forest named Panca-prastha,
where the King went to hunt, is the forest of the five sense objects: form, taste, sound, smell and touch.
Thus in these three verses Narada Muni describes the position of the material body and the encagement of
the living entity within it.
