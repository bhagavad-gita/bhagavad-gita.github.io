<h2>Text</h2>
aho vayam hy adya pavitra-kirte
tvayaiva nathena mukunda-nathah
ya uttamaslokatamasya visnor
brahmanya-devasya katham vyanakti
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--oh, goodness; vayam--we; hi--certainly; adya--today; pavitra-kirte--O supreme purity; tvaya--by
you; eva--certainly; nathena--by the Lord; mukunda--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; nathah--being
the subject of the Supreme; ye--one who; uttama-sloka-tamasya--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is praised by the nicest verses; visnoh--of Visnu; brahmanya-devasya--of the worshipable Lord of the
brahmanas; katham--words; vyanakti--expressed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The audience continued: Dear King Prthu, your reputation is the purest of all, for you are preaching the
glories of the most glorified of all, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord of the brahmanas. Since,
due to our great fortune, we have you as our master, we think that we are living directly under the agency
of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The citizens declared that through being under the protection of Maharaja Prthu, they were directly
under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This understanding is the proper situation
of social steadiness within this material world. Since it is stated in the Vedas that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is the maintainer and leader of all living entities, the king or the executive head of the
government must be a representative of the Supreme Person. Then he can claim honor exactly like the
Lord's. How a king or leader of society can become the representative of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is also indicated in this verse by the statement that because Prthu Maharaja was preaching the
supremacy and the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he was therefore a proper
representative of the Lord. To remain under the jurisdiction or administration of such a king or leader is
the perfect status for human society. The primary responsibility of such a king or leader is to protect the
brahminical culture and the cows in his state.
