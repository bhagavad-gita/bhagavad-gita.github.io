<h2>Text</h2>
dehinam atmavat-presthah
suhrdam nandi-vardhanah
mukta-sanga-prasango 'yam
danda-panir asadhusu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dehinam--to all living entities having a body; atma-vat--as himself; presthah--considering dear;
suhrdam--of his friends; nandi-vardhanah--increasing pleasures; mukta-sanga--with persons devoid of all
material contamination; prasangah--intimately associated; ayam--this King; danda-panih--a chastising
hand; asadhusu--to the criminals.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King will consider all embodied living entities as dear as his own self, and he will always be
increasing the pleasures of his friends. He will intimately associate with liberated persons, and he will be a
chastising hand to all impious persons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word dehinam refers to those who are embodied. The living entities are embodied in different
forms, which number 8,400,000 species. All of these were treated by the King in the same way he would
treat himself. In this age, however, so-called kings and presidents do not treat all other living entities as
their own self. Most of them are meat-eaters, and even though they may not be meat-eaters and may pose
themselves to be very religious and pious, they still allow cow slaughter within their state. Such sinful
heads of state cannot actually be popular at any time. Another significant word in this verse is muktasanga-
prasangah, which indicates that the King was always associating with liberated persons.
