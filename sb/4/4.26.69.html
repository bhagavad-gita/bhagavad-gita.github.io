<h2>Text</h2>
sattvaika-nisthe manasi
bhagavat-parsva-vartini
tamas candramasivedam
uparajyavabhasate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sattva-eka-nisthe--in full Krsna consciousness; manasi--in a mind; bhagavat--with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; parsva-vartini--being constantly associated; tamah--the dark planet; candramasi--
in the moon; iva--like; idam--this cosmic manifestation; uparajya--being connected; avabhasate--becomes
manifest.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Krsna consciousness means constantly associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in such a
mental state that the devotee can observe the cosmic manifestation exactly as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead does. Such observation is not always possible, but it becomes manifest exactly like the dark
planet known as Rahu, which is observed in the presence of the full moon.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has been explained in the previous verse that all desires on the mental platform become visible one
after another. Sometimes, however, by the supreme will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
whole stockpile can be visible all at one time. In Brahma-samhita (5.54) it is said, karmani nirdahati kintu
ca bhakti-bhajam. When a person is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness, his stockpile of material
desires is minimized. Indeed, the desires no longer fructify in the form of gross bodies. Instead, the
stockpile of desires becomes visible on the mental platform by the grace of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
In this connection, the darkness occurring before the full moon, the lunar eclipse, can be explained as
being another planet, known as Rahu. According to Vedic astronomy, the Rahu planet, which is not
visible, is accepted. Sometimes the Rahu planet is visible in the presence of full moonlight. It then appears
that this Rahu planet exists somewhere near the orbit of the moon. The failure of modern moon
excursionists may be due to the Rahu planet. In other words, those who are supposed to be going to the
moon may actually be going to this invisible planet Rahu. Actually, they are not going to the moon but to
the planet Rahu, and after reaching this planet, they come back. Apart from this discussion, the point is
that a living entity has immense and unlimited desires for material enjoyment, and he has to transmigrate
from one gross body to another until these desires are exhausted.
No living entity is free from the cycle of birth and death unless he takes to Krsna consciousness;
therefore in this verse it is clearly stated (sattvaika-nisthe) that when one is fully absorbed in Krsna
consciousness, in one stroke he is freed of past and future mental desires. Then, by the grace of the
Supreme Lord, everything becomes simultaneously manifest within the mind. In this regard, Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura cites the example of mother Yasoda's seeing the whole cosmic manifestation within
the mouth of Lord Krsna. By the grace of Lord Krsna, mother Yasoda saw all the universes and planets
within the mouth of Krsna. Similarly, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, a Krsna
conscious person can see all his dormant desires at one time and finish all his future transmigrations. This
facility is especially given to the devotee to make his path clear for returning home, back to Godhead.
Why we see things not experienced in this life is explained herein. That which we see is the future
expression of a gross body or is already stocked in our mental stockpile. Because a Krsna conscious
person does not have to accept a future gross body, his recorded desires are fulfilled in a dream. We
therefore sometimes find things in a dream never experienced in our present life.
