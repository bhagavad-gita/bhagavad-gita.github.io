<h2>Translation</h2>
The daughter of Time [Jara] was very unfortunate. Consequently she was known as Durbhaga ["illfated"].
However, she was once pleased with a great king, and because the king accepted her, she granted
him a great benediction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, saba sukha bhagala: all kinds of happiness disappear in old age.
Consequently, no one likes old age, or jara. Thus Jara, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most
unfortunate daughter. She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yayati. Yayati was cursed
by his father-in-law, Sukracarya, to accept her. When Sukracarya's daughter was married to King Yayati,
one of her friends named Sarmistha went with her. Later King Yayati became very much attached to
Sarmistha, and Sukracarya's daughter complained to her father. Consequently, Sukracarya cursed King
Yayati to become prematurely old. King Yayati had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to
exchange their youth for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was Puru.
Upon accepting Yayati's old age, Puru was given the kingdom. It is said that two of Yayati's other sons,
being disobedient to their father, were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and
Greece. The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material opulences, but during old
age one cannot enjoy them. Although Puru attained his father's kingdom, he could not enjoy all the
opulence, for he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to become Krsna
conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make progress in Krsna consciousness, however
opulent he may be materially.
