<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
evam sanjalpitam matur
akarnyarthagamam vacah
sanniyamyatmanatmanam
niscakrama pituh purat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--the great sage Maitreya said; evam--thus; sanjalpitam--spoken together; matuh--from
the mother; akarnya--hearing; artha-agamam--purposeful; vacah--words; sanniyamya--controlling;
atmana--by the mind; atmanam--own self; niscakrama--got out; pituh--of the father; purat--from the
house.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: The instruction of Dhruva Maharaja's mother, Suniti, was actually
meant for fulfilling his desired objective. Therefore, after deliberate consideration and with intelligence
and fixed determination, he left his father's house.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both the mother and the son were lamenting Dhruva Maharaja's having been insulted by his stepmother
and his father's not having taken any step on this issue. But mere lamentation is useless--one should find
out the means to mitigate one's lamentation. Thus both mother and son decided to take shelter of the
lotus feet of the Lord because that is the only solution to all material problems. It is indicated in this
connection that Dhruva Maharaja left his father's capital city to go to a secluded place to search out the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is the instruction of Prahlada Maharaja also that if one is seeking
peace of mind he should free himself from all contamination of family life and take shelter of the Supreme
Godhead by going to the forest. To the Gaudiya Vaisnava this forest is the forest of Vrnda, or Vrndavana.
If one takes shelter of Vrndavana under Vrndavanesvari, Srimati Radharani, certainly all the problems of
his life are solved very easily.
