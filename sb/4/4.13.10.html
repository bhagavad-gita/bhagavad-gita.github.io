<h2>Text</h2>
aher iva payah-posah
posakasyapy anartha-bhrt
venah prakrtyaiva khalah
sunitha-garbha-sambhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aheh--of a snake; iva--like; payah--with milk; posah--the maintaining; posakasya--of the maintainer;
api--even; anartha--against the interest; bhrt--becomes; venah--King Vena; prakrtya--by nature; eva--
certainly; khalah--mischievous; sunitha--of Sunitha, Vena's mother; garbha--the womb; sambhavah--born
of.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sages began to think within themselves: Because he was born from the womb of Sunitha, King Vena
is by nature very mischievous. Supporting this mischievous king is exactly like maintaining a snake with
milk. Now he has become a source of all difficulties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Saintly persons are generally aloof from social activities and the materialistic way of life. King Vena was
supported by the saintly persons just to protect the citizens from the hands of rogues and thieves, but
after his ascendance to the throne, he became a source of trouble to the sages. Saintly people are especially
interested in performing sacrifices and austerities for the advancement of spiritual life, but Vena, instead
of being obliged because of the saints' mercy, turned out to be their enemy because he prohibited them
from executing their ordinary duties. A serpent who is maintained with milk and bananas simply stores
poison in his teeth and awaits the day to bite his master.
