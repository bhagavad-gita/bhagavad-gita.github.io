<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, just try to understand the allegorical position of the deer. Be fully conscious of yourself,
and give up the pleasure of hearing about promotion to heavenly planets by fruitive activity. Give up
household life, which is full of sex, as well as stories about such things, and take shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through the mercy of the liberated souls. In this way, please give up your
attraction for material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In one of his songs, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura writes:
karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda,
amrta baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya
"Fruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison. Whoever drinks of them, thinking
them to be nectar, must struggle very hard, life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all
kinds of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense enjoyment."
People are generally enamored of the fruitive results of worldly activity and mental speculation. They
generally desire to be promoted to heavenly planets, merge into the existence of Brahman, or keep
themselves in the midst of family life, enchanted by the pleasures of the tongue and genitals. The great
sage Narada clearly instructs King Barhisman not to remain his entire life in the grhastha-asrama. Being in
the grhastha-asrama means being under the control of one's wife. One has to give up all this and put
himself into the asrama of the paramahamsa, that is, put himself under the control of the spiritual master.
The paramahamsa-asrama is the asrama of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, under whom the spiritual
master has taken shelter. The symptoms of the bona fide spiritual master are stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(11.3.21):
tasmad gurum prapadyeta
jijnasuh sreya uttamam
sabde pare ca nisnatam
brahmany upasamasrayam
"Any person who is seriously desirous of achieving real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual
master and take shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of a spiritual master is that he must have
realized the conclusion of the scriptures by deliberation and arguments and thus be able to convince
others of these conclusions. Such great personalities, who have taken complete shelter of the Supreme
Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be understood as bona fide spiritual masters."
A paramahamsa is one who has taken shelter of the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
If one takes shelter of the paramahamsa spiritual master, gradually, through training and instruction, he
will become detached from worldly life and ultimately return home, back to Godhead. The particular
mention of anganasramam asattama-yutha-gatham is very interesting. The whole world is in the clutches
of maya, being controlled by woman. Not only is one controlled by the woman who is one's wife, but one
is also controlled by so many sex literatures. That is the cause of one's being entangled in the material
world. One cannot give up this abominable association through one's own effort, but if one takes shelter
of a bona fide spiritual master who is a paramahamsa, he will gradually be elevated to the platform of
spiritual life.
The pleasing words of the Vedas that inspire one to elevate oneself to the heavenly planets or merge into
the existence of the Supreme are for the less intelligent who are described in Bhagavad-gita as
mayayapahrta jnanah (those whose knowledge is taken away by the illusory energy). Real knowledge
means understanding the miserable condition of material life. One should take shelter of a bona fide
liberated soul, the spiritual master, and gradually elevate himself to the spiritual platform and thus
become detached from the material world. According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, hamsasaranam
refers to the cottage in which saintly persons live. Generally a saintly person lives in a remote
place in the forest or in a humble cottage. However, we should note that the times have changed. It may
be beneficial for a saintly person's own interest to go to the forest and live in a cottage, but if one becomes
a preacher, especially in Western countries, he has to invite many classes of men who are accustomed to
living in comfortable apartments. Therefore in this age a saintly person has to make proper arrangements
to receive people and attract them to the message of Krsna consciousness. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Thakura, perhaps for the first time, introduced motorcars and palatial buildings for the residence of
saintly persons just to attract the general public in big cities. The main fact is that one has to associate
with a saintly person. In this age people are not going to search out a saint in the forest, so the saints and
sages have to come to the big cities to make arrangements to receive the people in general, who are
accustomed to the modern amenities of material life. Gradually such persons will learn that palatial
buildings or comfortable apartments are not at all necessary. The real necessity is to become free from
material bondage in whatever way possible. According to the orders of Srila Rupa Gosvami:
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayunjatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktam vairagyam ucyate
"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Krsna, one
is rightly situated above possessiveness." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255)
One should not be attached to material opulence, but material opulence may be accepted in the Krsna
consciousness movement to facilitate the propagation of the movement. In other words, material opulence
may be accepted as yukta-vairagya, that is, for renunciation.
