<h2>Text</h2>
apahata-sakalaisanamalatmany

<p></p>

constantly; edhita--increasing; bhavana--with feeling; upahutah--being called; nija-jana--of His devotees;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being completely cleansed of all material desires, the devotees are freed from all mental contamination.
Thus they can always think of the Lord constantly and address Him very feelingly. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, knowing Himself to be controlled by His devotees, does not leave them for a
second, just as the sky overhead never becomes invisible.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is clear from the previous verse that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janardana, is very quickly
satisfied by the activities of His devotees. The pure devotee is always absorbed in the thought of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated, srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah. By always thinking of Krsna, the
pure devotee's heart is freed from all kinds of desires. In the material world, the heart of the living entity
is filled with material desires. When the living entity is cleansed, he does not think of anything material.
As the mind is completely cleansed, one attains the perfectional stage of mystic yoga, for then the yogi
always sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart (dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa
pasyanti yam yoginah). As soon as the Lord is seated within the heart of the devotee, the devotee cannot
be contaminated by the material modes of nature. As long as one is under the control of the material
modes, he desires so many things and makes so many plans for material sense enjoyment, but as soon as
the Lord is perceived in the heart, all material desires vanish. When the mind is completely free from
material desire, the devotee can think of the Lord constantly. In this way he becomes completely
dependent upon the lotus feet of the Lord. Caitanya Mahaprabhu prays:
ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram
patitam mam visame bhavambudhau
krpaya tava pada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya
"My dear Lord, I am Your eternal servant, but somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of this
material world. Kindly pick me up and fix me as a speck of dust at Your lotus feet." (Siksastaka 5)
Similarly, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura prays:
ha ha prabhu nanda-suta, vrsabhanu-suta-yuta,
karuna karaha ei-bara
narottama-dasa kaya, na theliha ranga-paya,
toma vine ke ache amara
"My dear Lord, You are now present with the daughter of King Vrsabhanu, Srimati Radharani. Now
both of You please be merciful upon me. Don't kick me away, because I have no shelter other than You."
In this way the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes dependent on His devotee. The Lord is
invincible, yet He is conquered by His pure devotee. He enjoys being dependent on His devotee, just as
Krsna enjoyed being dependent on the mercy of mother Yasoda. Thinking Himself dependent on the
devotee gives the Supreme Lord great enjoyment. Sometimes a king may engage a joker, and in the
process of joking, the king is sometimes insulted. The king, however, enjoys these activities. Everyone
worships the Supreme Lord with great reverence; therefore the Lord sometimes wants to enjoy the
chastisement of His devotees. In this way the relationship eternally existing between the Lord and His
devotees is fixed, just like the sky overhead.
