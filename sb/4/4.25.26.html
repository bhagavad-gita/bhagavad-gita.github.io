<h2>Purport</h2>
The first aphorism in the Vedanta-sutra is athato brahma jijnasa. In the human form of life one should
put many questions to himself and to his intelligence. In the various forms of life lower than human life
the intelligence does not go beyond the range of life's primary necessities--namely eating, sleeping, mating
and defending. Dogs, cats and tigers are always busy trying to find something to eat or a place to sleep,
trying to defend and have sexual intercourse successfully. In the human form of life, however, one should
be intelligent enough to ask what he is, why he has come into the world, what his duty is, who is the
supreme controller, what is the difference between dull matter and the living entity, etc. There are so
many questions, and the person who is actually intelligent should simply inquire about the supreme
source of everything: athato brahma jijnasa. A living entity is always connected with a certain amount of
intelligence, but in the human form of life the living entity must inquire about his spiritual identity. This
is real human intelligence. It is said that one who is simply conscious of the body is no better than an
animal, even though he be in the human form. In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) Sri Krsna says, sarvasya caham
hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." In the animal form the living entity is completely forgetful
of his relationship with God. This is called apohanam, or forgetfulness. In the human form of life,
however, consciousness is more greatly developed, and consequently the human being has a chance to
understand his relationship with God. In the human form one should utilize his intelligence by asking all
these questions, just as Puranjana, the living entity, is asking the unknown girl where she has come from,
what her business is, why she is present, etc. These are inquiries about atma-tattva--self-realization. The
conclusion is that unless a living entity is inquisitive about self-realization he is nothing but an animal.
