<h2>Text</h2>
tam yajna-pasavo 'nena
samjnapta ye 'dayaluna
kutharais cicchiduh kruddhah
smaranto 'mivam asya tat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him; yajna-pasavah--the sacrificial animals; anena--by him; samjnaptah--killed; ye--all of them
who; adayaluna--by the most unkind; kutharaih--by axes; cicchiduh--pierced to pieces; kruddhah--being
very angry; smarantah--remembering; amivam--sinful activity; asya--of him; tat--that.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
That most unkind king, Puranjana, had killed many animals in various sacrifices. Now, taking
advantage of this opportunity, all these animals began to pierce him with their horns. It was as though he
were being cut to pieces by axes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Those who are very enthusiastic about killing animals in the name of religion or for food must await
similar punishment after death. The word mamsa ("meat") indicates that those animals whom we kill will
be given an opportunity to kill us. Although in actuality no living entity is killed, the pains of being
pierced by the horns of animals will be experienced after death. Not knowing this, rascals unhesitatingly
go on killing poor animals. So-called human civilization has opened many slaughterhouses for animals in
the name of religion or food. Those who are a little religious kill animals in temples, mosques or
synagogues, and those who are more fallen maintain various slaughterhouses. Just as in civilized human
society the law is a life for a life, no living entity can encroach upon another living entity as far as the
Supreme Lord is concerned. Everyone should be given freedom to live at the cost of the supreme father,
and animal-killing--either for religion or for food--is always condemned by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita (16.19) Lord Krsna says:
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life." The animal-killers (dvisatah), envying other
living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are placed in darkness and cannot understand the
theme and objective of life. This is further explained in the following verses.
