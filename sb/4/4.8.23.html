<h2>Text</h2>
tvad-bhratary uttame naste
mrgayayam tu tan-manah
anvesanti vanam mata
davagnim sa praveksyati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvat--your; bhratari--brother; uttame--Uttama; naste--being killed; mrgayayam--in hunting; tu--then; tatmanah--
being too afflicted; anvesanti--while searching out; vanam--in the forest; mata--the mother; davaagnim--
in the forest fire; sa--she; praveksyati--will enter.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord continued: Sometime in the future your brother, Uttama, will go hunting in the forest, and
while absorbed in hunting, he will be killed. Your stepmother, Suruci, being maddened upon the death of
her son, will go to search him out in the forest, but she will be devoured by a forest fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja came to the forest to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a revenging
spirit against his stepmother. His stepmother had insulted Dhruva, who was not an ordinary person, but a
great Vaisnava. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava is the greatest offense in this world. Because of
having insulted Dhruva Maharaja, Suruci would become mad upon the death of her son and would enter a
forest fire, and thus her life would be ended. This was specifically mentioned by the Lord to Dhruva
because he was determined for revenge against her. From this we should take the lesson that we should
never try to insult a Vaisnava. Not only should we not insult a Vaisnava, but we should not insult anyone
unnecessarily. When Suruci insulted Dhruva Maharaja, he was just a child. She of course did not know
that Dhruva was a great recognized Vaisnava, and so her offense was committed unknowingly. When one
serves a Vaisnava unknowingly, one still gets the good result, and if one unknowingly insults a Vaisnava,
one suffers the bad result. A Vaisnava is especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Pleasing him or displeasing him directly affects the pleasure and displeasure of the Supreme Lord. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, in his eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, has sung, yasya
prasadad bhagavat-prasadah: by pleasing the spiritual master, who is a pure Vaisnava, one pleases the
Personality of Godhead, but if one displeases the spiritual master one does not know where he is going.
