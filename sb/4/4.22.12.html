<h2>Translation</h2>
While Satadruti was thus being married, the demons, the denizens of Gandharvaloka, the great sages,
and the denizens of Siddhaloka, the earthly planets and Nagaloka, although highly exalted, were all
captivated by the tinkling of her ankle bells.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally a woman becomes more beautiful when, after an early marriage, she gives birth to a child. To
give birth to a child is the natural function of a woman, and therefore a woman becomes more and more
beautiful as she gives birth to one child after another. In the case of Satadruti, however, she was so
beautiful that she attracted the whole universe at her marriage ceremony. Indeed, she attracted all the
learned and exalted demigods simply by the tinkling of her ankle bells. This indicates that all the
demigods wanted to see her beauty completely, but they were not able to see it because she was fully
dressed and covered with ornaments. Since they could only see the feet of Satadruti, they became attracted
by her ankle bells, which tinkled as she walked. In other words, the demigods became captivated by her
simply by hearing the tinkling of her ankle bells. They did not have to see her complete beauty. It is
sometimes understood that a person becomes lusty just by hearing the tinkling of bangles on the hands of
women or the tinkling of ankle bells, or just by seeing a woman's sari. Thus it is concluded that woman is
the complete representation of maya. Although Visvamitra Muni was engaged in practicing mystic yoga
with closed eyes, his transcendental meditation was broken when he heard the tinkling of bangles on the
hands of Menaka. In this way Visvamitra Muni became a victim of Menaka and fathered a child who is
universally celebrated as Sakuntala. The conclusion is that no one can save himself from the attraction of
woman, even though he be an exalted demigod or an inhabitant of the higher planets. Only a devotee of
the Lord, who is attracted by Krsna, can escape the lures of woman. Once one is attracted by Krsna, the
illusory energy of the world cannot attract him.
