TRANSLATION
When he became completely free from the conception of bodily life, Maharaja Prthu realized Lord Krsna
sitting in everyone's heart as the Paramatma. Being thus able to get all instructions from Him, he gave up
all other practices of yoga and jnana. He was not even interested in the perfection of the yoga and jnana
systems, for he thoroughly realized that devotional service to Krsna is the ultimate goal of life and that
unless the yogis and jnanis become attracted to krsna-katha [narrations about Krsna], their illusions
concerning existence can never be dispelled.
PURPORT
As long as one is too much absorbed in the bodily conception of life, he becomes interested in many
different processes of self-realization, such as the mystic yoga system or the system utilizing the
speculative empiric methods. However, when one understands that the ultimate goal of life is to approach
Krsna, he realizes Krsna within everyone's heart and therefore helps everyone who is interested in Krsna
consciousness. Actually the perfection of life depends on one's inclination to hear about Krsna. It is
therefore mentioned in this verse: yavad gadagraja-kathasu ratim na kuryat. Unless one becomes
interested in Krsna, in His pastimes and activities, there is no question of liberation by means of yoga
practice or speculative knowledge.
Having attained to the stage of devotion, Maharaja Prthu became uninterested in the practices of jnana
and yoga and abandoned them. This is the stage of pure devotional life as described by Rupa Gosvami:
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
Real jnana means understanding that the living entity is the eternal servant of the Lord. This knowledge
is attained after many, many births, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.19): bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate. In the paramahamsa stage of life, one fully realizes Krsna as everything:
vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah. When one understands fully that Krsna is everything and
that Krsna consciousness is the highest perfection of life, he becomes a paramahamsa, or mahatma. Such a
mahatma or paramahamsa is very rare to find. A paramahamsa, or pure devotee, is never attracted by
hatha-yoga or speculative knowledge. He is simply interested in the unalloyed devotional service of the
Lord. Sometimes one who was formerly addicted to these processes tries to perform devotional service
and the jnana and yoga practices at the same time, but as soon as one comes to the unalloyed stage of
devotional service, he is able to give up all other methods of self-realization. In other words, when one
firmly realizes Krsna as the supreme goal, he is no longer attracted by mystic yoga practice or the
speculative empirical methods of knowledge.
