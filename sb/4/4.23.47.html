<h2>Text</h2>
khadyotavirmukhi ca prag
dvarav ekatra nirmite
vibhrajitam janapadam
yati tabhyam dyumat-sakhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
khadyota--of the name Khadyota; avirmukhi--of the name Avirmukhi; ca--also; prak--toward the eastern
side; dvarau--two gates; ekatra--in one place; nirmite--were constructed; vibhrajitam--of the name
Vibhrajita; jana-padam--city; yati--used to go; tabhyam--by them; dyumat--of the name Dyuman; sakhah--
with his friend.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The two gates named Khadyota and Avirmukhi were situated facing the eastern side, but they were
constructed in one place. Through those two gates the King used to go to the city of Vibhrajita
accompanied by a friend whose name was Dyuman.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The two names Khadyota and Avirmukhi mean "glowworm" and "torchlight." This indicates that of the
two eyes, the left eye is less powerful in its ability to see. Although both eyes are constructed in one place,
one is stronger than the other in the power to see. The king, or the living entity, uses these two gates to
see things properly, but he cannot see unless accompanied by a friend whose name is Dyuman. This
friend is the sun. Although the two eyes are situated in one place, they have no power to see without the
sunlight. Vibhrajitam janapadam. If one wants to see something very clearly (vibhrajitam), he must see it
with two eyes and the assistance of his friend the sunlight. Within this body everyone is a king because he
uses his different gates according to his own will. Although he is very much proud of his power to see or
hear, he is nonetheless dependent on the assistance of nature.
