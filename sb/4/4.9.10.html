TRANSLATION
My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditating upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your
glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahmananda, wherein one
thinks himself merged in the impersonal Brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahmananda is also
defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary
blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time?
Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time.
PURPORT
The transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, primarily from sravanam kirtanam, hearing
and chanting, cannot be compared to the happiness derived by karmis by elevating themselves to the
heavenly planets or by jnanis or yogis, who enjoy oneness with the supreme impersonal Brahman. Yogis
generally meditate upon the transcendental form of Visnu, but devotees not only meditate upon Him but
actually engage in the direct service of the Lord. In the previous verse we find the phrase bhavapyaya,
which refers to birth and death. The Lord can give relief from the chain of birth and death. It is a
misunderstanding to think, as do the monists, that when one gets relief from the process of birth and
death he merges into the Supreme Brahman. Here it is clearly said that the transcendental bliss derived
from sravanam kirtanam by pure devotees cannot be compared to brahmananda, or the impersonal
conception of transcendental bliss derived by merging into the Absolute.
The position of karmis is still more degraded. Their aim is to elevate themselves to the higher planetary
systems. It is said, yanti deva-vrata devan: persons who worship the demigods are elevated to the heavenly
planets (Bg. 9.25). But elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (9.21) we find, ksine punye martya-lokam visanti:
those who are elevated to the higher planetary systems must come down again as soon as the results of
their pious activities are exhausted. They are like the modern astronauts who go to the moon; as soon as
their fuel is used up, they are obliged to come back down to this earth. As the modern astronauts who go
to the moon or other heavenly planets by force of jet propulsion have to come down again after
exhausting their fuel, so also do those who are elevated to the heavenly planets by force of yajnas and
pious activities. Antakasi-lulitat: by the sword of time one is cut from his exalted position within this
material world, and he comes down again. Dhruva Maharaja appreciated that the results of devotional
service are far more valuable than merging into the Absolute or being elevated to the heavenly planets.
The words patatam vimanat are very significant. Vimana means "airplane." Those who are elevated to the
heavenly planets are like airplanes, which drop when they run out of fuel.
