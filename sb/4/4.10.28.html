<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Dhruva, at the age of only five years you were very grievously afflicted by the words of your
mother's co-wife, and you very boldly gave up the protection of your mother and went to the forest to
engage in the yogic process for realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As a result of this you
have already achieved the topmost position in all the three worlds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Manu was very proud that Dhruva Maharaja was one of the descendants in his family because at the age
of only five years Dhruva began meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead and within six
months he was able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. Factually, Dhruva Maharaja is the glory of the
Manu dynasty, or the human family. The human family begins from Manu. The Sanskrit word for man is
manusya, which means "descendant of Manu." Not only is Dhruva Maharaja the glory of the family of
Svayambhuva Manu, but he is the glory of the entire human society. Because Dhruva Maharaja had
already surrendered to the Supreme Godhead, he was especially requested not to do anything unbefitting
a surrendered soul.
