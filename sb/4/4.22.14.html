<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prthu Maharaja continued: My dear sirs, there is no need to ask about your good and bad fortune
because you are always absorbed in spiritual bliss. The mental concoction of the auspicious and
inauspicious does not exist in you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya 4.176) it is said:
'dvaite' bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba----'manodharma'
'ei bhala, ei manda,'----ei saba 'bhrama'
In this material world the auspicious and inauspicious are simply mental concoctions because such
things exist only due to association with the material world. This is called illusion, or atma-maya. We
think ourselves created by material nature exactly as we think ourselves experiencing so many things in a
dream. The spirit soul, however, is always transcendental. There is no question of becoming materially
covered. This covering is simply something like a hallucination or a dream. In Bhagavad-gita (2.62) it is
also said, sangat sanjayate kamah. Simply by association we create artificial material necessities. Dhyayato
visayan pumsah sangas tesupajayate. When we forget our real constitutional position and wish to enjoy
the material resources, our material desires manifest, and we associate with varieties of material
enjoyment. As soon as the concoctions of material enjoyment are there, because of our association we
create a sort of lust or eagerness to enjoy them, and when that false enjoyment does not actually make us
happy, we create another illusion, known as anger, and by the manifestation of anger, the illusion
becomes stronger. When we are illusioned in this way, forgetfulness of our relationship with Krsna
follows, and by thus losing Krsna consciousness, our real intelligence is defeated. In this way we become
entangled in this material world. In Bhagavad-gita (2.63) it is said:
krodhad bhavati sammohah
sammohat smrti-vibhramah
smrti-bhramsad buddhi-naso
buddhi-nasat pranasyati
By material association we lose our spiritual consciousness; consequently there is the question of the
auspicious and inauspicious. But those who are atmarama, or self-realized, have transcended such
questions. The atmaramas, or self-realized persons, gradually making further progress in spiritual bliss,
come to the platform of association with the Supreme personality of Godhead. That is the perfection of
life. In the beginning, the Kumaras were self-realized impersonalists, but gradually they became attracted
to the personal pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that for those who are always engaged in
the devotional service of the Personality of Godhead, the duality of the auspicious and inauspicious does
not arise. Prthu Maharaja is therefore asking about auspiciousness not for the sake of the Kumaras but for
his own sake.
