<h2>Text</h2>
pitradistah praja-sarge
tapase 'rnavam avisan
dasa-varsa-sahasrani
tapasarcams tapas-patim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pitra--by the father; adistah--being ordered by; praja-sarge--in the matter of begetting children; tapase--
for executing austerity; arnavam--in the ocean; avisan--entered; dasa-varsa--ten years; sahasrani--such
thousands; tapasa--by their austerity; arcan--worshiped; tapah--of austerity; patim--the master.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When all these Pracetas were ordered by their father to marry and beget children, they all entered the
ocean and practiced austerities and penances for ten thousand years. Thus they worshiped the master of
all austerity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes great sages and ascetics enter the Himalaya Mountains in order to find seclusion from the
turmoil of the world. It appears, however, that all the Pracetas, the sons of Pracinabarhi, entered the
depths of the ocean to perform austerity in a secluded place. Since they performed austerities for ten
thousand years, this incident took place in the Satya-yuga, when people used to live for a hundred
thousand years. It is also significant that by their austerity they worshiped the master of austerity, Sri
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to perform austerities and penances in order to
attain the supreme goal, one must attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one achieves
the favor of the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has finished all kinds of austerities and
penances and has attained efficiency in their execution. On the other hand, if one does not attain the
perfect stage of devotional service, all austerities and penances actually have no meaning, for without the
Supreme Lord no one can attain the highest results derived from performing them. As stated in Bhagavadgita
(5.29), Lord Sri Krsna is the master of all penances and sacrifices. Bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarvaloka-
mahesvaram. Thus the desired result of performing austerities may be derived from Lord Krsna.
In Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.7) it is stated:
aho bata sva-paco 'to gariyan
yaj-jihvagre vartate nama tubhyam
tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur arya
brahmanucur nama grnanti ye te
Even if a person is born in a family of candalas--the lowest birth one can get in human society--he is
glorious if he chants the holy names of the Lord, for it is to be understood that by such chanting a devotee
definitely proves that he underwent all kinds of austerities in his previous life. By the grace of Lord
Caitanya, one who chants the maha-mantra (Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare
Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare) attains the highest perfectional stage, which had previously
been attained by people who entered the ocean and executed austerities for ten thousand years. In this age
of Kali, if a person does not take advantage of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, which is offered as a great
concession to the fallen human beings of this age, it is to be understood that he is very much bewildered
by the illusory energy of the Lord.
