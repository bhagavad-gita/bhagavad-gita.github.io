<h2>Translation</h2>
One should not go to anyone's house, even on the consideration of his being a relative or a friend, when
the man is disturbed in his mind and looks upon the guest with raised eyebrows and angry eyes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
However low a person may be, he is never unkind to his children, wife and nearest kin; even a tiger is
kind to its cubs, for within the animal kingdom the cubs are treated very nicely. Since Sati was the
daughter of Daksa, however cruel and contaminated he might be, naturally it was expected that he would
receive her very nicely. But here it is indicated by the word anavasthita that such a person cannot be
trusted. Tigers are very kind to their cubs, but it is also known that sometimes they eat them. Malicious
persons should not be trusted, because they are always unsteady. Thus Sati was advised not to go to her
father's house because to accept such a father as a relative and to go to his house without being properly
invited was not suitable.
