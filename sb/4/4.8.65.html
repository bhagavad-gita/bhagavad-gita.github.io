<h2>Translation</h2>
The saintly King Uttanapada, hearing of the glorious deeds of Dhruva Maharaja and personally seeing
also how influential and great he was, felt very satisfied, for Dhruva's activities were wonderful to the
supreme degree.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja was in the forest executing his austerities, his father, Uttanapada, heard
everything about his very wonderful activities. Although Dhruva Maharaja was the son of a king and was
only five years old, he went to the forest and executed devotional service under strict austerity. Therefore
his acts were all wonderful, and when he came back home, naturally, because of his spiritual
qualifications, he became very popular amongst the citizens. He must have performed many wonderful
activities by the grace of the Lord. No one is more satisfied than the father of a person who is credited
with glorious activities. Maharaja Uttanapada was not an ordinary king; he was a rajarsi, a saintly king.
Formerly this earth was ruled by one saintly king only. Kings were trained to become saintly; therefore
they had no other concern than the welfare of the citizens. These saintly kings were properly trained, and
as mentioned in Bhagavad-gita also, the science of God, or the yoga system of devotional service known as
Bhagavad-gita, was spoken to the saintly king of the sun planet, and gradually it descended through the
ksatriya kings who were generated from the sun and the moon. If the head of the government is saintly,
certainly the citizens become saintly, and they are very happy because both their spiritual and physical
needs and hankerings are satisfied.
