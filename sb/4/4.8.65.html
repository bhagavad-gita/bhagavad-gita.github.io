<h2>Translation</h2>
The King replied: O best of the brahmanas, I am very much addicted to my wife, and I am so fallen that
I have abandoned all merciful behavior, even to my son, who is only five years old. I have banished him
and his mother, even though he is a great soul and a great devotee.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse there are some specific words which are to be understood very carefully. The King said that
since he was very much addicted to his wife, he had lost all his mercy. That is the result of becoming too
affectionate toward women. The King had two wives; the first wife was Suniti, and the second was Suruci.
He was too attached to the second wife, however, so he could not behave well with Dhruva Maharaja.
That was the cause of Dhruva's leaving home to perform austerities. Although as a father the King was
affectionate toward his son, he minimized his affection for Dhruva Maharaja because he was too much
addicted to the second wife. Now he was repenting that both Dhruva Maharaja and his mother, Suniti,
were practically banished. Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest, and since his mother was being neglected
by the King, she was therefore almost banished also. The King repented having banished his boy, for
Dhruva was only five years old and a father should not banish his wife and children or neglect their
maintenance. Repentant over his neglect of both Suniti and her son, he was morose, and his face appeared
withered. According to Manu-smrti, one should never desert his wife and children. In a case where the
wife and children are disobedient and do not follow the principles of home life, they are sometimes given
up. But in the case of Dhruva Maharaja this was not applicable because Dhruva was very mannerly and
obedient. Moreover, he was a great devotee. Such a person is never to be neglected, yet the King was
obliged to banish him. Now he was very sorry.
