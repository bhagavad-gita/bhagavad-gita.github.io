<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
cacara mrgayam tatra
drpta attesu-karmukah
vihaya jayam atad-arham
mrga-vyasana-lalasah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
cacara--executed; mrgayam--hunting; tatra--there; drptah--being proud; atta--having taken; isu--arrows;
karmukah--bow; vihaya--giving up; jayam--his wife; a-tat-arham--although impossible; mrga--hunting;
vyasana--evil activities; lalasah--being inspired by.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It was almost impossible for King Puranjana to give up the company of his Queen even for a moment.
Nonetheless, on that day, being very much inspired by the desire to hunt, he took up his bow and arrow
with great pride and went to the forest, not caring for his wife.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One form of hunting is known as woman-hunting. A conditioned soul is never satisfied with one wife.
Those whose senses are very much uncontrolled especially try to hunt for many women. King Puranjana's
abandoning the company of his religiously married wife is representative of the conditioned soul's attempt
to hunt for many women for sense gratification. Wherever a king goes, he is supposed to be accompanied
by his queen, but when the king, or conditioned soul, becomes greatly overpowered by the desire for
sense gratification, he does not care for religious principles. Instead, with great pride, he accepts the bow
and arrow of attachment and hatred. Our consciousness is always working in two ways--the right way and
the wrong way. When one becomes too proud of his position, influenced by the mode of passion, he gives
up the right path and accepts the wrong one. Ksatriya kings are sometimes advised to go to the forest to
hunt ferocious animals just to learn how to kill, but such forays are never meant for sense gratification.
Killing animals to eat their flesh is forbidden for human beings.
