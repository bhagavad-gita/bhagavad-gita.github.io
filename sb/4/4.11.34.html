<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tatra tatra prasamsadbhih
pathi vaimanikaih suraih
avakiryamano dadrse
kusumaih kramaso grahan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra tatra--here and there; prasamsadbhih--by persons engaged in the praise of Dhruva Maharaja;
pathi--on the path; vaimanikaih--carried by different types of airplanes; suraih--by the demigods;
avakiryamanah--being covered; dadrse--could see; kusumaih--by flowers; kramasah--one after another;
grahan--all the planets of the solar system.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Dhruva Maharaja was passing through space, he gradually saw all the planets of the solar system,
and on the path he saw all the demigods in their airplanes showering flowers upon him like rain.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a Vedic version, yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati, which means that by knowing
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything becomes known to the devotee. Similarly, by going to
the planet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can know all the other planetary systems on the
path to Vaikuntha. We should remember that Dhruva Maharaja's body was different from our bodies.
While boarding the Vaikuntha airplane, his body changed to a completely spiritual golden hue. No one
can surpass the higher planets in a material body, but when one gets a spiritual body he can travel not
only to the higher planetary system of this material world, but even to the still higher planetary system
known as Vaikunthaloka. It is well known that Narada Muni travels everywhere, both in the spiritual and
material worlds.
It should be noted also that while Suniti was going to Vaikunthaloka she also changed her body into
spiritual form. Like Sri Suniti, every mother should train her child to become a devotee like Dhruva
Maharaja. Suniti instructed her son, even at the age of five years, to be unattached to worldly affairs and to
go to the forest to search out the Supreme Lord. She never desired that her son remain at home
comfortably without ever undertaking austerities and penances to achieve the favor of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Every mother, like Suniti, must take care of her son and train him to become a
brahmacari from the age of five years and to undergo austerities and penances for spiritual realization.
The benefit will be that if her son becomes a strong devotee like Dhruva, certainly not only will he be
transferred back home, back to Godhead, but she will also be transferred with him to the spiritual world,
even though she may be unable to undergo austerities and penances in executing devotional service.
