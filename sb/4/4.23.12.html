<h2>Translation</h2>
After this, King Puranjana decorated his body with suitable ornaments. He also smeared scented
sandalwood pulp over his body and put on flower garlands. In this way he became completely refreshed.
After this, he began to search out his Queen.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a man comes into good consciousness and accepts a saintly person as a spiritual master, he hears
many Vedic instructions in the form of philosophy, stories, narrations about great devotees and
transactions between God and His devotees. In this way a man becomes refreshed in mind, exactly like a
person who smears scented sandalwood pulp all over his body and decorates himself with ornaments.
These decorations may be compared to knowledge of religion and the self. Through such knowledge one
becomes detached from a materialistic way of life and engages himself in always hearing Srimad-
Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures. The word sadhv-alankrta used in this verse
indicates that one must be absorbed in knowledge gathered from the instructions of saintly persons. Just
as King Puranjana began to search out his better half, the Queen, one who is decorated with knowledge
and instructions from saintly persons should try to search out his original consciousness, Krsna
consciousness. One cannot return to Krsna consciousness unless he is favored by the instructions of a
saintly person. Therefore Srila Narottama dasa Thakura sings: sadhu-sastra-guru-vakya, cittete kariya
aikya. If we want to become saintly persons, or if we want to return to our original Krsna consciousness,
we must associate with sadhu (a saintly person), sastra (authoritative Vedic literature) and guru (a bona
fide spiritual master). This is the process.
