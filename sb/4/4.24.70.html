bhutesu--in every living being; avasthitam--situated; pujayadhvam--just worship Him; grnantah ca--
always chanting; dhyayantah ca--always meditating upon; asakrt--continuously; harim--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, O sons of the King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is situated in everyone's heart.
He is also within your hearts. Therefore chant the glories of the Lord and always meditate upon Him
continuously.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word asakrt is significant, for it means not just for a few minutes but continuously. That is the
instruction given by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu in His Siksastaka. Kirtaniyah sada harih: "The holy name
of the Lord should be chanted twenty-four hours daily." Therefore in this Krsna consciousness movement
we request the devotees to chant at least sixteen rounds on their beads daily. Actually one has to chant
twenty-four hours daily, just like Thakura Haridasa, who was chanting the Hare Krsna mantra three
hundred thousand times daily. Indeed, he had no other business. Some of the Gosvamis, like Raghunatha
dasa Gosvami, were also chanting very rigidly and also offering obeisances very rigidly. As stated in
Srinivasacarya's prayer to the six Gosvamis (Sad-gosvamy-astaka): sankhya-purvaka-nama-gana-natibhih
kalavasani-krtau. The word sankhya-purvaka means "maintaining a numerical strength." Not only was
Raghunatha dasa Gosvami chanting the holy name of the Lord, but he was also offering obeisances in the
same prolific numbers.
Because the princes were ready to enter into some severe austerity in order to worship the Lord, Lord
Siva advised them to constantly chant of and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is
significant that Lord Siva personally offered his prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead just as he
was taught by his father, Lord Brahma. Similarly, he was also preaching to the princes according to the
parampara system. One not only should practice the instructions received from the spiritual master but
should also distribute this knowledge to one's disciples.
The words atmanam atma-stham sarva-bhutesv avasthitam are also significant. The Personality of
Godhead is the origin of all living entities. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, He
is the father of all of them. One can search out the Supreme Lord very easily within one's heart, for He is
situated in every living entity's heart. In this verse the process of worshiping the Lord is considered to be
very easy and complete, for anyone can sit down anywhere and in any condition of life and simply chant
the holy names of the Lord. By chanting and hearing, one automatically engages in meditation.
