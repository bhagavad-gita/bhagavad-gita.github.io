<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who worship You simply for the sense gratification of this bag of skin are certainly influenced
by Your illusory energy. In spite of having You, who are like a desire tree and are the cause of liberation
from birth and death, foolish persons, such as me, desire benedictions from You for sense gratification,
which is available even for those who live in hellish conditions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja repented because he had come to the Lord to render devotional service for material
profit. He here condemns his attitude. Only due to gross lack of knowledge does one worship the Lord for
material profit or for sense gratification. The Lord is like a desire tree. Anyone can have whatever he
desires from the Lord, but people in general do not know what kind of benediction they should ask from
Him. Happiness derived from the touch of skin, or sensuous happiness, is present in the life of hogs and
dogs. Such happiness is very insignificant. If a devotee worships the Lord for such insignificant happiness,
he must be considered devoid of all knowledge.
