<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni continued: What I referred to as the chariot was in actuality the body. The senses are the
horses that pull that chariot. As time passes, year after year, these horses run without obstruction, but in
fact they make no progress. Pious and impious activities are the two wheels of the chariot. The three
modes of material nature are the chariot's flags. The five types of life air constitute the living entity's
bondage, and the mind is considered to be the rope. Intelligence is the chariot driver. The heart is the
sitting place in the chariot, and the dualities of life, such as pleasure and pain, are the knotting place. The
seven elements are the coverings of the chariot, and the working senses are the five external processes.
The eleven senses are the soldiers. Being engrossed in sense enjoyment, the living entity, seated on the
chariot, hankers after fulfillment of his false desires and runs after sense enjoyment life after life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The entanglement of the living entity in sense enjoyment is very nicely explained in these verses. The
word samvatsara, meaning "the progress of time," is significant. Day after day, week after week, fortnight
after fortnight, month after month, year after year, the living entity becomes entangled in the chariot's
progress. The chariot rests on two wheels, which are pious and impious activities. The living entity attains
a certain position in life in a particular type of body according to his pious and impious activities, but his
transmigration into different bodies should not be taken as progress. Real progress is explained in
Bhagavad-gita (4.9). Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: one makes real progress when he does not have to
take on another material body. As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 19.138):
eita brahmanda bhari' ananta jiva-gana
caurasi-laksa yonite karaye bhramana
The living entity is wandering throughout the entire universe and taking birth in different species on
different planets. Thus he moves up and down, but that is not real progress. Real progress is getting out of
this material world altogether. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):
abrahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein
repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kunti, never takes birth
again." Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, the highest planet in the universe, he has to come down
again to the lower planetary systems. Thus he is wandering up and down perpetually, under the influence
of the three modes of material nature. Being illusioned, he thinks he is making progress. He is like an
airplane encircling the earth day and night, incapable of leaving the earth's gravitational field. Factually
there is no progress because the airplane is conditioned by the earth's gravity.
Just as a king is seated on a chariot, the living entity is seated in the body. The sitting place is the heart,
and the living entity sits there and engages in the struggle for existence, which goes on without progress
perpetually. In the words of Narottama dasa Thakura:
karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda,
amrta baliya yeba khaya
nana yoni sada phire, kadarya bhaksana kare,
tara janma adhah-pate yaya
The living entity struggles very hard due to the influence of fruitive activity and mental speculation and
simply gets a different type of body life after life. He eats all kinds of nonsense and is condemned by his
activities of sense enjoyment, If one really wants to progress in life, he must give up the ways of karmakanda
and jnana-kanda, fruitive activities and mental speculation. Being fixed in Krsna consciousness,
one can become free from the entanglement of birth and death and the vain struggle for existence. In
these verses the words mrga-trsnam pradhavati are very significant because the living entity is influenced
by a thirst for sense enjoyment. He is like a deer that goes to the desert to search out water. In a desert an
animal simply searches in vain for water. Of course there is no water in the desert, and the animal simply
sacrifices his life in an attempt to find it. Everyone is planning for future happiness, thinking that
somehow or other, if he can reach a certain point, he will be happy. In actuality, however, when he comes
to that point, he sees that there is no happiness. He then plans to go further and further to another point.
This is called mrga-trsna, and its basis is sense enjoyment in this material world.
