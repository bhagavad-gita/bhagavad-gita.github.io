<h2>Text</h2>
saranam tam prapadye 'ham
ya eva jagad-isvarah
prajam atma-samam mahyam
prayacchatv iti cintayan
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
saranam--taking shelter; tam--unto Him; prapadye--surrender; aham--I; yah--one who; eva--certainly;
jagat-isvarah--master of the universe; prajam--son; atma-samam--like Himself; mahyam--unto me;
prayacchatu--let Him give; iti--thus; cintayan--thinking.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He was thinking: May the Lord of the universe, of whom I have taken shelter, kindly he pleased to offer
me a son exactly like Him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that the great sage Atri Muni had no specific idea of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Of
course, he must have been conversant with the Vedic information that there is a Supreme Personality of
Godhead who is the creator of the universe, from whom everything emanated, who maintains this created
manifestation, and in whom the entire manifestation is conserved after dissolution. Yato va imani bhutani
(Taittiriya Upanisad 3.1.1). The Vedic mantras give us information of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, so Atri Muni concentrated his mind upon that Supreme Personality of Godhead, even without
knowing His name, just to beg from Him a child exactly on His level. This kind of devotional service, in
which knowledge of God's name is lacking, is also described in Bhagavad-gita where the Lord says that
four kinds of men with backgrounds of pious activities come to Him asking for what they need. Atri Muni
wanted a son exactly like the Lord, and therefore he is not supposed to have been a pure devotee, because
he had a desire to be fulfilled, and that desire was material. Although he wanted a son exactly like the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, this desire was material because he did not want the Personality of
Godhead Himself, but only a child exactly like Him. If he had desired the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as his child, he would have been completely free of material desires because he would have
wanted the Supreme Absolute Truth, but because he wanted a similar child, his desire was material. Thus
Atri Muni cannot be counted among the pure devotees.
