dhruva uvaca
samadhina naika-bhavena yat padam
viduh sanandadaya urdhva-retasah
masair aham sadbhir amusya padayos
chayam upetyapagatah prthan-matih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dhruvah uvaca--Dhruva Maharaja said; samadhina--by practicing yoga in trance; na--never; ekabhavena--
by one birth; yat--which; padam--position; viduh--understood; sananda-adayah--the four
brahmacaris headed by Sanandana; urdhva-retasah--infallible celibates; masaih--within months; aham--I;
sadbhih--six; amusya--of Him; padayoh--of the lotus feet; chayam--shelter; upetya--achieving; apagatah--
fell down; prthak-matih--my mind fixed on things other than the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja thought to himself: To endeavor to be situated in the shade of the lotus feet of the
Lord is not an ordinary task because even the great brahmacaris headed by Sanandana, who practiced
astanga-yoga in trance, attained the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet only after many, many births. Within
six months I achieved the same result, yet due to my thinking differently from the Lord, I fell down from
my position.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse Dhruva Maharaja himself explains the cause of his moroseness. First he laments that to see
the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly is not easy. Even great saintly persons like the four
celebrated brahmacaris headed by Sanandana--Sanandana, Sanaka, Sanatana and Sanat-kumara--practiced
the yoga system for many, many births and remained in trance before getting the opportunity to see the
Supreme Lord face to face. As far as Dhruva Maharaja was concerned, he saw the Supreme Lord
personally after only six months of practice in devotional service. He expected, therefore, that as soon as
he met the Supreme Lord, the Lord would take him to His abode immediately, without waiting. Dhruva
Maharaja could understand very clearly that the Lord had offered him the rule of the world for thirty-six
thousand years because in the beginning he was under the spell of the material energy and wanted to take
revenge against his stepmother and rule over his father's kingdom. Dhruva Maharaja greatly lamented his
propensity for ruling the material world and his revengeful attitude towards other living entities.
