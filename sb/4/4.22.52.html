<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, Your two lotus feet are so beautiful that they appear like two blossoming petals of the
lotus flower which grows during the autumn season. Indeed, the nails of Your lotus feet emanate such a
great effulgence that they immediately dissipate all the darkness in the heart of a conditioned soul. My
dear Lord, kindly show me that form of Yours which always dissipates all kinds of darkness in the heart of
a devotee. My dear Lord, You are the supreme spiritual master of everyone; therefore all conditioned souls
covered with the darkness of ignorance can be enlightened by You as the spiritual master.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva has thus described the bodily features of the Lord authoritatively. Now he wants to see the
lotus feet of the Lord. When a devotee wants to see the transcendental form of the Lord, he begins his
meditation on the Lord's body by first looking at the feet of the Lord. Srimad-Bhagavatam is considered to
be the transcendental sound form of the Lord, and the twelve cantos are divided in accordance with the
transcendental form of the Lord. The First and Second Cantos of Srimad-Bhagavatam are called the two
lotus feet of the Lord. It is therefore suggested by Lord Siva that one should first try to see the lotus feet of
the Lord. This also means that if one is serious about reading Srimad-Bhagavatam, he must begin by
seriously studying the First and Second Cantos.
The beauty of the lotus feet of the Lord is compared to the petals of a lotus flower which grows in the
autumn season. By nature's law, in autumn the dirty or muddy waters of rivers and lakes become very
clean. At that time the lotus flowers growing in the lakes appear very bright and beautiful. The lotus
flower itself is compared to the lotus feet of the Lord, and the petals are compared to the nails of the feet
of the Lord. The nails of the feet of the Lord are very bright, as Brahma-samhita testifies. Ananda-cinmayasad-
ujjvala-vigrahasya: every limb of the transcendental body of the Lord is made of ananda-cinmaya-sadujjvala.
Thus every limb is eternally bright. As sunshine dissipates the darkness of this material world, the
effulgence emanating from the body of the Lord immediately dries up the darkness in the heart of the
conditioned soul. In other words, everyone serious about understanding the transcendental science and
seeing the transcendental form of the Lord must first of all attempt to see the lotus feet of the Lord by
studying the First and Second Cantos of Srimad-Bhagavatam. When one sees the lotus feet of the Lord, all
kinds of doubts and fears within the heart are vanquished.
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that in order to make spiritual progress, one must become fearless. Abhayam
sattva-samsuddhih (Bg. 16.1). Fearfulness is the result of material involvement. It is also said in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (11.2.37), bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah syat: fearfulness is a creation of the bodily conception
of life. As long as one is absorbed in the thought that he is this material body, he is fearful, and as soon as
one is freed from this material conception, he becomes brahma-bhuta, or self-realized, and immediately
becomes fearless. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma (Bg. 18.54). Without being fearless, one cannot be joyful.
The bhaktas, the devotees, are fearless and always joyful because they are constantly engaged in the
service of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is also said:
evam prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah
bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam
mukta-sangasya jayate
(Bhag. 1.2.20)
By practicing bhagavad-bhakti-yoga, one becomes fearless and joyful. Unless one becomes fearless and
joyful, he cannot understand the science of God. Bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam mukta-sangasya jayate. This
verse refers to those who are completely liberated from the fearfulness of this material world. When one is
so liberated, he can really understand the transcendental features of the form of the Lord. Lord Siva
therefore advises everyone to practice bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. As will be clear in the following verses, by
doing so one can become really liberated and enjoy spiritual bliss.
It is also stated:
om ajnana-timirandhasya
jnananjana-salakaya
caksur unmilitam yena
tasmai sri-gurave namah
The Lord is the supreme spiritual master, and the bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord is also a
spiritual master. The Lord from within enlightens the devotees by the effulgence of the nails of His lotus
feet, and His representative, the spiritual master, enlightens from without. Only by thinking of the lotus
feet of the Lord and always taking the spiritual master's advice can one advance in spiritual life and
understand Vedic knowledge.
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
Thus the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23) enjoin that for one who has unflinching faith in the lotus
feet of the Lord, as well as in the spiritual master, the real import of Vedic knowledge can be revealed.
