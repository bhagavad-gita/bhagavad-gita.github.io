manuh svayambhur bhagavan bhavas ca

<br>

manuh--Svayambhuva Manu; svayambhuh--Lord Brahma; bhagavan--the most powerful; bhavah--Lord
Siva; ca--also; ye--who; anye--others; tapah--by austerity; jnana--by knowledge; visuddha--pure; sattvah--
whose existence; adrsta-parah--who cannot see the end; api--although; yat--Your; mahimnah--of glories;
stuvanti--they offer prayers; atho--therefore; tva--unto You; atma-samam--according to capacity;
grnimah--we offered prayers.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear Lord, even great yogis and mystics who are very much advanced by virtue of austerities and
knowledge and who have completely situated themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities
like Manu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies. Nonetheless
they have offered their prayers according to their own capacities. In the same way, we, although much
lower than these personalities, also offer our prayers according to our own capability.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Manu (the father of mankind), great saintly persons and also great sages who
have elevated themselves to the transcendental platform through austerities and penance, as well as
devotional service, are imperfect in knowledge compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is
the case with anyone within this material world. No one can be equal to the Supreme Lord in anything,
certainly not in knowledge. Consequently, anyone's prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
never complete. It is not possible to measure the complete glories of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimited.
Even the Lord Himself in His incarnation as Ananta, or Sesa, cannot describe His own glories. Although
Ananta has many thousands of faces and has been glorifying the Lord for many, many years, He could not
find the limit of the glories of the Lord. Thus it is not possible to estimate the complete potencies and
glories of the Supreme Lord.
Nonetheless, everyone in devotional service can offer essential prayers to the Lord. Everyone is situated
in a relative position, and no one is perfect in glorifying the Lord. Beginning with Lord Brahma and Lord
Siva down to ourselves, everyone is the servant of the Supreme Lord. We are all situated in relative
positions according to our own karma. Yet every one of us can offer prayers with heart and soul as far as
we can appreciate the Lord's glories. That is our perfection. Even when one is in the darkest region of
existence, he is allowed to offer prayers to the Lord according to his own capacity. The Lord therefore
says in Bhagavad-gita (9.32):
mam hi partha vyapasritya
ye 'pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sudras
te 'pi yanti param gatim
"O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth--women, vaisyas
[merchants], as well as sudras [workers]--can approach the supreme destination."
If one seriously accepts the lotus feet of the Lord, he is purified by the grace of the Lord and by the
grace of the Lord's servant. This is confirmed by Sukadeva Gosvami: ye 'nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah
sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah (Bhag. 2.4.18). One who is brought under the lotus feet of the
Lord by the endeavor of the Lord's servant, the spiritual master, is certainly immediately purified,
however lowborn he may be. He becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.
