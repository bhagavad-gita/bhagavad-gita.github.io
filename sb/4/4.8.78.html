<h2>Translation</h2>
When Dhruva Maharaja thus captured the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the refuge of the
total material creation and who is the master of all living entities, the three worlds began to tremble.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the particular word brahma is very significant. Brahman refers to one who not only is the
greatest, but has the potency to expand to an unlimited extent. How was it possible for Dhruva Maharaja
to capture Brahman within his heart? This question has been very nicely answered by Jiva Gosvami. He
says that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of Brahman, for since He comprises everything
material and spiritual, there cannot be anything greater than He. In the Bhagavad-gita also the Supreme
Godhead says, "I am the resting place of Brahman." Many persons, especially the Mayavadi philosophers,
consider Brahman the biggest, all-expanding substance, but according to this verse and other Vedic
literatures, such as Bhagavad-gita, the resting place of Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
just as the resting place of the sunshine is the sun globe. Srila Jiva Gosvami, therefore, says that since the
transcendental form of the Lord is the seed of all greatness, He is the Supreme Brahman. Since the
Supreme Brahman was situated in the heart of Dhruva Maharaja, he became heavier than the heaviest, and
therefore everything trembled in all three worlds and in the spiritual world.
The mahat-tattva, or the sum total of the material creation, is to be understood to be the ultimate end of
all universes, including all the living entities therein. Brahman is the resort of the mahat-tattva, which
includes all material and spiritual entities. It is described in this connection that the Supreme Brahman,
the Personality of Godhead, is the master of both pradhana and purusa. Pradhana means subtle matter,
such as ether. purusa means the spiritual spark living entities who are entangled in that subtle material
existence. These may also be described as para prakrti and apara prakrti, as stated in Bhagavad-gita. Krsna,
being the controller of both the prakrtis, is thus the master of pradhana and purusa. In the Vedic hymns
also the Supreme Brahman is described as antah-pravistah sasta. This indicates that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is controlling everything and entering into everything. The Brahma-samhita
(5.35) further confirms this. Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: He has entered not only the
universes, but even the atom. In Bhagavad-gita (10.42) Krsna also says, vistabhyaham idam krtsnam. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead controls everything by entering into everything. By associating
constantly with the Supreme Personality in his heart, Dhruva Maharaja naturally became equal to the
greatest, Brahman, by His association, and thus became the heaviest, and the entire universe trembled. ln
conclusion, a person who always concentrates on the transcendental form of Krsna within his heart can
very easily strike the whole world with wonder at his activities. This is the perfection of yoga
performance, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (6.47). Yoginam api sarvesam: of all yogis, the bhakti-yogi,
who thinks of Krsna always within his heart and engages in His loving transcendental service, is the
topmost. Ordinary yogis can exhibit wonderful material activities, known as asta-siddhi, eight kinds of
yogic perfection, but a pure devotee of the Lord can surpass these perfections by performing activities
which can make the whole universe tremble.
