<h2>Text</h2>
daiteya danava vatsam
prahladam asurarsabham
vidhayaduduhan ksiram
ayah-patre surasavam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
daiteyah--the sons of Diti; danavah--demons; vatsam--the calf; prahladam--Prahlada Maharaja; asura--
demon; rsabham--the chief; vidhaya--making; aduduhan--they milked out; ksiram--milk; ayah--iron;
patre--in a pot; sura--liquor; asavam--fermented liquids like beer.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sons of Diti and the demons transformed Prahlada Maharaja, who was born in an asura family, into
a calf, and they extracted various kinds of liquor and beer, which they put into a pot made of iron.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demons also have their own types of beverages in the form of liquors and beers, just as the
demigods use soma-rasa for their drinking purposes. The demons born of Diti take great pleasure in
drinking wine and beer. Even today people of demoniac nature are very much addicted to liquor and beer.
The name of Prahlada Maharaja is very significant in this connection. Because Prahlada Maharaja was
born in a family of demons, as the son of Hiranyakasipu, by his mercy the demons were and still are able
to have their drinks in the form of wine and beer. The word ayah (iron) is very significant. Whereas the
nectarean soma was put in a golden pot, the liquors and beers were put in an iron pot. Because the liquor
and beer are inferior, they are placed in an iron pot, and because soma-rasa is superior, it is placed in a
golden pot.
