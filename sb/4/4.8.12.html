<h2>Text</h2>
te na smaranty atitaram priyam isa martyam
ye canv adah suta-suhrd-grha-vitta-darah
ye tv abja-nabha bhavadiya-padaravindasaugandhya-
lubdha-hrdayesu krta-prasangah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
te--they; na--never; smaranti--remember; atitaram--highly; priyam--dear; isa--O Lord; martyam--material
body; ye--they who; ca--also; anu--in relationship with; adah--that; suta--sons; suhrt--friends; grha--home;
vitta--wealth; darah--and wife; ye--those who; tu--then; abja-nabha--O Lord who have a lotus navel;
bhavadiya--of Your; pada-aravinda--lotus feet; saugandhya--the fragrance; lubdha--have achieved;
hrdayesu--with devotees whose hearts; krta-prasangah--have association.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord who have a lotus navel, if a person happens to associate with a devotee whose heart always
hankers after Your lotus feet, seeking always their fragrance, he is never attached to the material body or,
in a bodily relationship, to offspring, friends, home, wealth and wife, which are very, very dear to
materialistic persons. Indeed, he does not care for them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A special advantage in devotional service is that devotees not only enjoy the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord by hearing and chanting and glorifying them, but also are not very much attached to their
bodies, unlike the yogis, who are too attached to the body and who think that by performing bodily
gymnastic exercises they will advance in spiritual consciousness. Yogis are generally not very much
interested in devotional service; they want to regulate the breathing process. This is simply a bodily
concern. Here Dhruva Maharaja plainly says that a devotee has no more bodily interest. He knows that he
is not the body. From the very beginning, therefore, without wasting time in bodily exercises, a devotee
searches out a pure devotee and simply by his association becomes more advanced in spiritual
consciousness than any yogi. Because a devotee knows that he is not the body, he is never affected by
bodily happiness or distress. He is not interested in bodily relationships with wife, children, home, bank
balance, etc., or in the distress and happiness which come from these things. This is the special advantage
of being a devotee. This status of life is possible only when a person is interested in associating with a
pure devotee, who always enjoys the fragrance of the lotus feet of the Lord.
