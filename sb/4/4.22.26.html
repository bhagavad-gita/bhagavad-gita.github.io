<h2>Text</h2>
sa tan prapannarti-haro
bhagavan dharma-vatsalah
dharma-jnan sila-sampannan
pritah pritan uvaca ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--Lord Siva; tan--them; prapanna-arti-harah--one who drives away all kinds of dangers; bhagavan--
the lord; dharma-vatsalah--very much fond of religious principles; dharma-jnan--persons who are aware
of religious principles; sila-sampannan--very well behaved; pritah--being pleased; pritan--of very gentle
behavior; uvaca--talked with them; ha--in the past.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva became very pleased with the Pracetas because generally Lord Siva is the protector of pious
persons and persons of gentle behavior. Being very much pleased with the princes, he began to speak as
follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, or Krsna, is known as bhakta-vatsala, and herein we find
Lord Siva described as dharma-vatsala. Of course, the word dharma-vatsala refers to a person who lives
according to religious principles. That is understood. Nonetheless, these two words have additional
significance. Sometimes Lord Siva has to deal with persons who are in the modes of passion and
ignorance. Such persons are not always very much religious and pious in their activities, but since they
worship Lord Siva for some material profit, they sometimes obey the religious principles. As soon as Lord
Siva sees that his devotees are following religious principles, he blesses them. The Pracetas, sons of
Pracinabarhi, were naturally very pious and gentle, and consequently Lord Siva was immediately pleased
with them. Lord Siva could understand that the princes were sons of Vaisnavas, and as such Lord Siva
offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows.
