<h2>Translation</h2>
Upon becoming fixed in his attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the
spiritual master and by awakening knowledge and detachment, the living entity, situated within the heart
of the body and covered by the five elements, burns up his material surroundings exactly as fire, arising
from wood, burns the wood itself.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that both the jivatma, the individual soul, and the Paramatma live together within the heart. In
the Vedic version it is stated, hrdi hy ayam atma: the soul and Supersoul both live within the heart. The
individual soul is liberated when it comes out of the material heart or cleanses the heart to make it
spiritualized. The example given here is very appropriate: yonim ivotthito'gnih. Agni, or fire, comes out of
wood, and by it the wood is completely destroyed. Similarly, when a living entity increases his attachment
for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is to be considered like fire. A blazing fire is visible by its
exhibition of heat and light; similarly, when the living entity within the heart becomes enlightened with
full spiritual knowledge and detached from the material world, he burns up his material covering of the
five elements--earth, water, fire, air and sky--and becomes free from the five kinds of material
attachments, namely ignorance, false egoism, attachment to the material world, envy and absorption in
material consciousness. Therefore pancatmakam, as mentioned in this verse, refers to either the five
elements or the five coverings of material contamination. When these are all burned into ashes by the
blazing fire of knowledge and detachment, one is fixed firmly in the devotional service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and advances one's
attraction for Krsna by the spiritual master's instructions, the five coverings of the living entity cannot be
uncovered from the material heart. The living entity is centered within the heart, and to take him away
from the heart is to liberate him. This is the process. One must take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master
and by his instruction increase one's knowledge in devotional service, become detached from the material
world and thus become liberated. An advanced devotee, therefore, does not live within the material body
but within his spiritual body, just as a dry coconut lives detached from the coconut husk, even though
within the husk. The pure devotee's body is therefore called cin-maya-sarira ("spiritualized body"). In
other words, a devotee's body is not connected with material activities, and as such, a devotee is always
liberated (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate), as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26). Srila Rupa Gosvami also
confirms this:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"Whatever his condition may be, one who is engaged fully with his body, mind and speech in the
service of the Lord is liberated, even within this body."
