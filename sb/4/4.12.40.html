<h2>Text</h2>
sa sarasanam udyamya
mrgayur vana-gocarah
hanty asadhur mrgan dinan
veno 'sav ity arauj janah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--that boy of the name Vena; sarasanam--his bow; udyamya--taking up; mrgayuh--the hunter; vanagocarah--
going into the forest; hanti--used to kill; asadhuh--being very cruel; mrgan--deer; dinan--poor;
venah--Vena; asau--there he is; iti--thus; araut--would cry; janah--all the people.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After fixing his bow and arrow, the cruel boy used to go to the forest and unnecessarily kill innocent
deer, and as soon as he came all the people would cry, "Here comes cruel Vena! Here comes cruel Vena!"
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Ksatriyas are allowed to hunt in the forest for the purpose of learning the killing art, not to kill animals
for eating or for any other purpose. The ksatriya kings were sometimes expected to cut off the head of a
culprit in the state. For this reason the ksatriyas were allowed to hunt in the forest. Because this son of
King Anga, Vena, was born of a bad mother, he was very cruel, and he used to go to the forest and
unnecessarily kill the animals. All the neighboring inhabitants would be frightened by his presence, and
they would call, "Here comes Vena! Here comes Vena!" So from the beginning of his life he was fearful to
the citizens.
