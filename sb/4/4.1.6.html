<h2>Text</h2>

tustayam tosam apanno
'janayad dvadasatmajan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--her; kamayanam--desiring; bhagavan--the Lord; uvaha--married; yajusam--of all sacrifices; patih--
master; tustayam--in His wife, who was very much pleased; tosam--great pleasure; apannah--having

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord of the ritualistic performance of yajna later married Daksina, who was anxious to have the
Personality of Godhead as her husband, and in this wife the Lord was also very much pleased to beget
twelve children.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
An ideal husband and wife are generally called Laksmi-Narayana to compare them to the Lord and the
goddess of fortune, for it is significant that Laksmi-Narayana are forever happy as husband and wife. A
wife should always remain satisfied with her husband, and a husband should always remain satisfied with
his wife. In the Canakya-sloka, the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, it is said that if a husband and
wife are always satisfied with one another, then the goddess of fortune automatically comes. In other
words, where there is no disagreement between husband and wife, all material opulence is present, and
good children are born. Generally, according to Vedic civilization, the wife is trained to be satisfied in all
conditions, and the husband, according to Vedic instruction, is required to please the wife with sufficient
food, ornaments and clothing. Then, if they are satisfied with their mutual dealings, good children are
born. In this way the entire world can become peaceful, but unfortunately in this age of Kali there are no
ideal husbands and wives; therefore unwanted children are produced, and there is no peace and
prosperity in the present-day world.
