<h2>Translation</h2>
The allegory of King Puranjana, described herein according to authority, was heard by me from my
spiritual master, and it is full of spiritual knowledge. If one can understand the purpose of this allegory,
he will certainly be relieved from the bodily conception and will clearly understand life after death.
Although one may not understand what transmigration of the soul actually is, one can fully understand it
by studying this narration.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word striya, meaning "along with the wife," is significant. The male and female living together
constitute the sum and substance of material existence. The attraction between male and female in this
material world is very strong. In all species of life the attraction between male and female is the basic
principle of existence. The same principle of intermingling is also in human society, but is in a regulative
form. Material existence means living together as male and female and being attracted by one another.
However, when one fully understands spiritual life, his attraction for the opposite sex is completely
vanquished. By such attraction, one becomes overly attached to this material world. It is a hard knot
within the heart.
pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam
tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho 'yam aham mameti
(Bhag. 5.5.8)
Everyone comes to this material world attracted to sense gratification, and the hard knot of sense
gratification is the attraction between male and female. By this attraction, one becomes overly attached to
the material world in terms of grha-ksetra-suta-apta-vitta--that is, home, land, children, friends, money
and so forth. Thus one becomes entangled in the bodily conception of "I" and "mine." However, if one
understands the story of King Puranjana and understands how, by sexual attraction, Puranjana became a
female in his next life, one will also understand the process of transmigration.
SPECIAL NOTE: According to Vijayadhvaja Tirtha, who belongs to the Madhvacarya-sampradaya, the
first two of the following verses appear after verse 45 of this chapter, and the remaining two verses appear
after verse 79.
