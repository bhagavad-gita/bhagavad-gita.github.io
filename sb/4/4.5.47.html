<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who observe everything with differentiation, who are simply attached to fruitive activities, who
are mean minded, who are always pained to see the flourishing condition of others and who thus give
distress to them by uttering harsh and piercing words have already been killed by providence. Thus there
is no need for them to be killed again by an exalted personality like you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Persons who are materialistic and always engaged in fruitive activities for material profit cannot endure
seeing the flourishing life of others. Except for a few persons in Krsna consciousness, the entire world is
full of such envious persons, who are perpetually full of anxieties because they are attached to the
material body and are without self-realization. Since their hearts are always filled with anxiety, it is
understood that they have already been killed by providence. Thus Lord Siva, as a self-realized Vaisnava,
was advised not to kill Daksa. A Vaisnava is described as para-duhkha-duhkhi because although he is
never distressed in any condition of life, he is distressed to see others in a distressed condition. Vaisnavas,
therefore, should not try to kill by any action of the body or mind, but should try to revive the Krsna
consciousness of others out of compassion for them. The Krsna consciousness movement has been started
to deliver the envious persons of the world from the clutches of maya, and even though devotees are
sometimes put into trouble, they push on the Krsna consciousness movement in all tolerance. Lord
Caitanya advises:
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
"One can chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking himself lower than the
straw in the street. One should be more tolerant than the tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and
ready to offer all respects to others. ln such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord
constantly." (Siksastaka 3)
A Vaisnava should follow the examples of such Vaisnavas as Haridasa Thakura, Nityananda Prabhu and
also Lord Jesus Christ. There is no need to kill anyone who has already been killed. But it should be noted
herewith that a Vaisnava should not tolerate the blaspheming of Visnu or Vaisnavas, although he should
tolerate personal insults to himself.
