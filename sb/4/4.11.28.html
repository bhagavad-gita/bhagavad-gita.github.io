associates; mukhyayoh--of the chief; madhu-cyutam--like pouring honey; vacam--speeches; urukramapriyah--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Maitreya continued: Maharaja Dhruva was very dear to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. When he heard the sweet speeches of the Lord's chief associates in the Vaikuntha planet, he
immediately took his sacred bath, dressed himself with suitable ornaments, and performed his daily
spiritual duties. Thereafter he offered his respectful obeisances to the great sages present there and
accepted their blessings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We should mark how dutiful Dhruva Maharaja was in his devotional service, even at the time he left
this material world. He was constantly alert in the performance of devotional duties. Every devotee should
take his bath early in the morning and decorate his body with tilaka. In Kali-yuga one can hardly acquire
gold or jeweled ornaments, but the twelve tilaka marks on the body are sufficient as auspicious
decorations to purify the body. Since Dhruva Maharaja was living at that time at Badarikasrama, there
were other great sages there. He did not become puffed up because the airplane sent by Lord Visnu was
waiting for him; as a humble Vaisnava, he accepted blessings from all the sages before riding on the plane
brought by the chief of the Vaikuntha associates.
