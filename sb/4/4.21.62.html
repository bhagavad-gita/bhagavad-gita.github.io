<h2>Translation</h2>
In his personal behavior, Prthu Maharaja exhibited all good qualities, and in spiritual knowledge he was
exactly like Brhaspati. In self-control he was like the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. As far as
his devotional service was concerned, he was a great follower of devotees who were attached to cow
protection and the rendering of all service to the spiritual master and the brahmanas. He was perfect in his
shyness and in his gentle behavior, and when he engaged in some philanthropic activity, he worked as if
he were working for his own personal self.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Lord Caitanya talked to Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya, the Lord honored him as the incarnation of
Brhaspati. Brhaspati is the chief priest of the heavenly kingdom, and he is a follower of the philosophy
known as brahma-vada, or Mayavada. Brhaspati is also a great logician. It appears from this statement that
Maharaja Prthu, although a great devotee constantly engaged in the loving service of the Lord, could
defeat all kinds of impersonalists and Mayavadis by his profound knowledge of Vedic scriptures. We
should learn from Maharaja Prthu that a Vaisnava, or devotee, must not only be fixed in the service of the
Lord, but, if required, must be prepared to argue with the impersonalist Mayavadis with all logic and
philosophy and defeat their contention that the Absolute Truth is impersonal.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ideal self-controller or brahmacari. When Krsna was elected
to be president of the Rajasuya yajna performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira, Grandfather Bhismadeva
praised Lord Krsna as the greatest brahmacari. Because Grandfather Bhismadeva was a brahmacari, he was
quite fit to distinguish a brahmacari from a vyabhicari. Although Prthu Maharaja was a householder and
father of five children, he was still considered to be most controlled. One who begets Krsna conscious
children for the benefit of humanity is actually a brahmacari. One who simply begets children like cats
and dogs is not a proper father. The word brahmacari also refers to one who acts on the platform of
Brahman, or devotional service. In the impersonal Brahman conception, there is no activity, yet when one
performs activities in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is to be known as
brahmacari. Thus Prthu Maharaja was an ideal brahmacari and grhastha simultaneously.
Visvaksenanuvartisu refers to those devotees who are constantly engaged in the service of the Lord. Other
devotees must follow in their footsteps. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura said, ei chaya gosani yara, mui tara
dasa. He is prepared to become the disciple of anyone who follows in the footsteps of the six Gosvamis.
Also, like all Vaisnavas, Maharaja Prthu was devoted to cow protection, spiritual masters and qualified
brahmanas. Prthu Maharaja was also very humble, meek and gentle, and whenever he performed any
philanthropic work or welfare activity for the general public, he would labor exactly as if he were tending
to his own personal necessities. In other words, his philanthropic activities were not for the sake of show
but were performed out of personal feeling and commitment. All philanthropic activities should be thus
performed.
