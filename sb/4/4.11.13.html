<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja ruled over this planet for thirty-six thousand years; he diminished the reactions of
pious activities by enjoyment, and by practicing austerities he diminished inauspicious reactions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That Dhruva Maharaja ruled over the planet for thirty-six thousand years means that he was present in
the Satya-yuga because in the Satya-yuga people used to live for one hundred thousand years. In the next
yuga, Treta, people used to live for ten thousand years, and in the next yuga, Dvapara, for one thousand
years. In the present age, the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life is one hundred years. With the
change of the yugas, the duration of life and memory, the quality of kindness and all other good qualities
diminish. There are two kinds of activities, namely pious and impious. By executing pious activities one
can gain facilities for higher material enjoyment, but due to impious activities one has to undergo severe
distress. A devotee, however, is not interested in enjoyment or affected by distress. When he is prosperous
he knows, "I am diminishing the results of my pious activities," and when he is in distress he knows, "I
am diminishing the reactions of my impious activities." A devotee is not concerned with enjoyment or
distress; he simply desires to execute devotional service. It is said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that
devotional service should be apratihata, unchecked by the material conditions of happiness or distress.
The devotee undergoes processes of austerity such as observing Ekadasi and similar other fasting days and
refraining from illicit sex life, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. Thus he becomes purified from the
reactions of his past impious life, and because he engages in devotional service, which is the most pious
activity, he enjoys life without separate endeavor.
