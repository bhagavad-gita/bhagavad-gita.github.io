TRANSLATION
The Lord is very satisfied with His devotee when the devotee greets other people with tolerance, mercy,
friendship and equality.
PURPORT
It is the duty of an advanced devotee in the second stage of devotional perfection to act in accordance
with this verse. There are three stages of devotional life. In the lowest stage, a devotee is simply concerned
with the Deity in the temple, and he worships the Lord with great devotion, according to rules and
regulations. In the second stage the devotee is cognizant of his relationship with the Lord, his relationship
with fellow devotees, his relationship with persons who are innocent and his relationship with persons
who are envious. Sometimes devotees are ill-treated by envious persons. It is advised that an advanced
devotee should be tolerant; he should show complete mercy to persons who are ignorant or innocent. A
preacher-devotee is meant to show mercy to innocent persons, whom he can elevate to devotional service.
Everyone, by constitutional position, is an eternal servant of God. Therefore, a devotee's business is to
awaken everyone's Krsna consciousness. That is his mercy. As for a devotee's treatment of other devotees
who are his equals, he should maintain friendship with them. His general view should be to see every
living entity as part of the Supreme Lord. Different living entities appear in different forms of dress, but
according to the instruction of the Bhagavad-gita, a learned person sees all living entities equally. Such
treatment by the devotee is very much appreciated by the Supreme Lord. lt is said, therefore, that a saintly
person is always tolerant and merciful, he is a friend to everyone, never an enemy to anyone, and he is
peaceful. These are some of the good qualities of a devotee.
