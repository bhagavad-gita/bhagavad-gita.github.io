arcir nama maha-rajni
tat-patny anugata vanam
sukumary atad-arha ca
yat-padbhyam sparsanam bhuvah
SYNONYMS
arcih nama--of the name Arci; maha-rajni--the Queen; tat-patni--the wife of Maharaja Prthu; anugata--
who followed her husband; vanam--in the forest; su-kumari--very delicate body; a-tat-arha--who did not
deserve; ca--also; yat-padbhyam--by the touch of whose feet; sparsanam--touching; bhuvah--on the earth.
TRANSLATION
The Queen, the wife of Prthu Maharaja, whose name was Arci, followed her husband into the forest.
Since she was a queen, her body was very delicate. Although she did not deserve to live in the forest, she
voluntarily touched her lotus feet to the ground.
PURPORT
Because Prthu Maharaja's wife was the Queen and also a daughter of a king, she never experienced
walking on the ground, for queens used to never come out of the palace. They certainly never went to the
forests and tolerated all the difficulties of living in the wilderness. In Vedic civilization there are hundreds
of similar examples of such renunciation on the part of queens and dedication to the husband. The
goddess of fortune mother Sita followed her husband, Ramacandra, when He went to the forest. Lord
Ramacandra went to the forest in compliance with the order of His father, Maharaja Dasaratha, but
mother Sita was not so ordered. Nonetheless, she voluntarily accepted the path of her husband. Similarly,
Gandhari, the wife of King Dhrtarastra, also followed her husband into the forest. Being the wives of great
personalities like Prthu, Lord Ramacandra and Dhrtarastra, these were ideal chaste women. Such queens
also instructed the general people by showing them how to become a chaste wife and follow the husband
in every stage of life. When the husband is king, she sits beside him as the queen, and when he goes to the
forest, she also follows, despite having to tolerate all kinds of difficulties in living in the forest. Therefore
it is said here (atad-arha) that although she did not want to touch her feet to the ground, she nonetheless
accepted all difficulties when she went to the forest with her husband.
