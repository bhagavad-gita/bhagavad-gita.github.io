<h2>Translation</h2>
When there is a congregation of devotees, their discussions, questions and answers become conclusive
to both the speaker and the audience. Thus such a meeting is beneficial for everyone's real happiness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hearing discussions among the devotees is the only means to receive the powerful message of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. For instance, Bhagavad-gita has been well known all over the world for
a very long time, especially in the Western world, but because the subject matter was not discussed by
devotees, there was no effect. Not a single person in the West became Krsna conscious before the Krsna
consciousness movement was founded. But when the same Bhagavad-gita was presented as it is through
the disciplic succession, the effect of spiritual realization was immediately manifested.
Sanat-kumara, one of the Kumaras, informed Prthu Maharaja that his meeting with the Kumaras
benefited not only Maharaja Prthu but the Kumaras as well. When Narada Muni questioned Lord Brahma
about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Brahma thanked Narada Muni for giving him a chance
to speak about the Supreme Lord. Therefore questions put by a saintly person to another saintly person
about the Supreme Personality of Godhead or about the ultimate goal of life surcharge everything
spiritually. Whoever takes advantage of such discussions is benefited both in this life and in the next.
The word ubhayesam can be described in many ways. Generally there are two classes of men, the
materialist and the transcendentalist. By hearing discussions between devotees, both the materialist and
transcendentalist are benefited. The materialist is benefited by association with devotees because his life
then becomes regulated so that his chance of becoming a devotee or making the present life successful for
understanding the real position of the living entity is increased. When one takes advantage of this
opportunity, he is assured of a human form of life in the next birth, or he may be liberated completely and
go back home, back to Godhead. The conclusion is that if one participates in a discussion of devotees, he
is both materially and spiritually benefited. The speaker and the audience are both benefited, and the
karmis and jnanis are benefited. The discussion of spiritual matters amongst devotees is beneficial for
everyone, without exception. Consequently the Kumaras admitted that not only was the King benefited by
such a meeting, but the Kumaras were as well.
