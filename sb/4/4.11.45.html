<h2>Translation</h2>
By hearing the narration of Dhruva Maharaja one can fulfill desires for wealth, reputation and increased
duration of life. It is so auspicious that one can even go to a heavenly planet or attain Dhruvaloka, which
was achieved by Dhruva Maharaja, just by hearing about him. The demigods also become pleased because
this narration is so glorious, and it is so powerful that it can counteract all the results of one's sinful
actions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are different types of men in this world, not all of them pure devotees. Some are karmis, desiring
to acquire vast wealth. There are also persons who are only after reputation. Some desire to be elevated to
the heavenly planets or to go to Dhruvaloka, and others want to please the demigods to get material
profits. Herein it is recommended by Maitreya that every one of them can hear the narration about
Dhruva Maharaja and thus get their desired goal. It is recommended that the devotees (akama), the
karmis (sarva-kama) and the jnanis, who desire to be liberated (moksa-kama), should all worship the
Supreme personality of Godhead to acquire their desired goals of life. Similarly, if anyone hears about the
activities of the Lord's devotee, he can achieve the same result. There is no difference between the
activities and character of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those of His pure devotees.
