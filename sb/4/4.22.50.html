<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's abdomen is beautiful due to three ripples in the flesh. Being so round, His abdomen
resembles the leaf of a banyan tree, and when He exhales and inhales, the movement of the ripples
appears very, very beautiful. The coils within the navel of the Lord are so deep that it appears that the
entire universe sprouted out of it and yet again wishes to go back.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole universe is born out of the lotus stem which sprouted from the navel of the Lord. Lord
Brahma sat on the top of this lotus stem to create the whole universe. The navel of the Lord is so deep and
coiling that it appears that the whole universe again wants to withdraw into the navel, being attracted by
the Lord's beauty. The Lord's navel and the ripples on His belly always increase the beauty of His bodily
features. The details of the bodily features of the Lord especially indicate the Personality of Godhead.
Impersonalists cannot appreciate the beautiful body of the Lord, which is described in these prayers by
Lord Siva. Although the impersonalists are always engaged in the worship of Lord Siva, they are unable to
understand the prayers offered by Lord Siva to the bodily features of Lord Visnu. Lord Visnu is known as
siva-virinci-nutam (Bhag. 11.5.33), for He is always worshiped by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva.
