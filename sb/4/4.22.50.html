TRANSLATION
Being self-satisfied, Maharaja Prthu executed his duties as perfectly as possible according to the time
and his situation, strength and financial position. His only aim in all his activities was to satisfy the
Absolute Truth. In this way, he duly acted.
PURPORT
Maharaja Prthu was a responsible monarch, and he had to execute the duties of a ksatriya, a king and a
devotee at the same time. Being perfect in the Lord's devotional service, he could execute his prescribed
duties with complete perfection as befitted the time and circumstance and his financial strength and
personal ability. In this regard, the word karmani in this verse is significant. Prthu Maharaja's activities
were not ordinary, for they were in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srila Rupa
Gosvami has advised that things which are favorable to devotional service should not be rejected, nor
should activity favorable for devotional service be considered ordinary work or fruitive activity. For
example, an ordinary worker conducts business in order to earn money for his sense gratification. A
devotee may perform the same work in exactly the same way, but his aim is to satisfy the Supreme Lord.
Consequently his activities are not ordinary.
Prthu Maharaja's activities were therefore not ordinary but were all spiritual and transcendental, for his
aim was to satisfy the Lord. Just as Arjuna, who was a warrior, had to fight to satisfy Krsna, Prthu
Maharaja performed his royal duties as king for the satisfaction of Krsna. Indeed, whatever he did as
emperor of the whole world was perfectly befitting a pure devotee. It is therefore said by a Vaisnava poet,
vaisnavera kriyamudra vijne na bujhaya: no one can understand the activities of a pure devotee. A pure
devotee's activities may appear like ordinary activities, but behind them there is profound significance--
the satisfaction of the Lord. In order to understand the activities of a Vaisnava, one has to become very
expert. Maharaja Prthu did not allow himself to function outside the institution of four varnas and four
asramas, although as a Vaisnava he was a paramahamsa, transcendental to all material activities. He
remained at his position as a ksatriya to rule the world and at the same time remained transcendental to
such activities by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Concealing himself as a pure devotee,
he externally manifested himself as a very powerful and dutiful king. In other words, none of his activities
were carried out for his own sense gratification; everything he did was meant for the satisfaction of the
senses of the Lord. This is clearly explained in the next verse.
