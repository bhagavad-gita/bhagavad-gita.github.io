<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, please search out that deer who is engaged in eating grass in a very nice flower garden
along with his wife. That deer is very much attached to his business, and he is enjoying the sweet singing
of the bumblebees in his garden. Just try to understand his position. He is unaware that before him is a
tiger, which is accustomed to living at the cost of another's flesh. Behind the deer is a hunter, who is
threatening to pierce him with sharp arrows. Thus the deer's death is imminent.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an allegory in which the King is advised to find a deer that is always in a dangerous position.
Although threatened from all sides, the deer simply eats grass in a nice flower garden, unaware of the
danger all around him. All living entities, especially human beings, think themselves very happy in the
midst of families. As if living in a flower garden and hearing the sweet humming of bumblebees, everyone
is centered around his wife, who is the beauty of family life. The bumblebees' humming may be compared
to the talk of children. The human being, just like the deer, enjoys his family without knowing that before
him is the factor of time, which is represented by the tiger. The fruitive activities of a living entity simply
create another dangerous position and oblige him to accept different types of bodies. For a deer to run
after a mirage of water in the desert is not unusual. The deer is also very fond of sex. The conclusion is
that one who lives like a deer will be killed in due course of time. Vedic literatures therefore advise that
we should understand our constitutional position and take to devotional service before death comes.
According to the Bhagavatam (11.9.29):
labdhva sudurlabham idam bahu-sambhavante
manusyam arthadam anityam apiha dhirah
turnam yateta na pated anumrtyu yavan
nihsreyasaya visayah khalu sarvatah syat
After many births we have attained this human form; therefore before death comes, we should engage
ourselves in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the fulfillment of human life.
