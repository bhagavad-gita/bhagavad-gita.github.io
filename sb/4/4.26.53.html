TRANSLATION
The brahmana continued: My dear friend, even though you cannot immediately recognize Me, can't you
remember that in the past you had a very intimate friend? Unfortunately, you gave up My company and
accepted a position as enjoyer of this material world.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.27):
iccha-dvesa-samutthena
dvandva-mohena bharata
sarva-bhutani sammoham
sarge yanti parantapa
"O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome
by the dualities of desire and hate." This is an explanation of how the living entity falls down into this
material world. In the spiritual world there is no duality, nor is there hate. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead expands Himself into many. In order to enjoy bliss more and more, the Supreme Lord expands
Himself in different categories. As mentioned in the Varaha purana, He expands Himself in visnu-tattva
(the svamsa expansion) and in His marginal potency (the vibhinnamsa, or the living entity). These
expanded living entities are innumerable, just as the minute molecules of sunshine are innumerable
expansions of the sun. The vibhinnamsa expansions, the marginal potencies of the Lord, are the living
entities. When the living entities desire to enjoy themselves, they develop a consciousness of duality and
come to hate the service of the Lord. In this way the living entities fall into the material world. In the
prema-vivarta it is said:
krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga-vancha kare
nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare
The natural position of the living entity is to serve the Lord in a transcendental loving attitude. When
the living entity wants to become Krsna Himself or imitate Krsna, he falls down into the material world.
Since Krsna is the supreme father, His affection for the living entity is eternal. When the living entity falls
down into the material world, the Supreme Lord, through His svamsa expansion (Paramatma), keeps
company with the living entity. In this way the living entity may some day return home, back to Godhead.
By misusing his independence, the living entity falls down from the service of the Lord and takes a
position in this material world as an enjoyer. That is to say, the living entity takes his position within a
material body. Wanting to take a very exalted position, the living entity instead becomes entangled in a
repetition of birth and death. He selects his position as a human being, a demigod, a cat, a dog, a tree, etc.
In this way the living entity selects a body out of the 8,400,000 forms and tries to satisfy himself by a
variety of material enjoyment. The Supersoul, however, does not like him to do this. Consequently, the
Supersoul instructs him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord then takes
charge of the living entity. But unless the living entity is uncontaminated by material desires, he cannot
surrender to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (5.29) the Lord says:
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
"The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all
planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs
of material miseries."
The Supreme Lord is the supreme friend of everyone; however, no one can take advantage of the
supreme friend's instructions while making his own plans to become happy and entangling himself in the
modes of material nature. When there is creation, the living entities take on different forms according to
past desires. This means that all the species or forms of life are simultaneously created. Darwin's theory
stating that no human being existed from the beginning but that humans evolved after many, many years
is simply a nonsensical theory. From Vedic literature we find that the first creature within the universe is
Lord Brahma. Being the most intelligent personality, Lord Brahma could take charge of creating all the
variety found within this material world.
