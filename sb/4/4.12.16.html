<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus Dhruva Maharaja, at the end, left his kingdom, which extended all over the earth and was
bounded by the great oceans. He considered his body, his wives, his children, his friends, his army, his
rich treasury, his very comfortable palaces and his many enjoyable pleasure-grounds to be creations of the
illusory energy. Thus in due course of time he retired to the forest in the Himalayas known as
Badarikasrama.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the beginning of his life, when he went to the forest in search of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Dhruva Maharaja realized that all bodily conceptions of pleasure are products of the illusory energy. In
the very beginning, of course, he was after the kingdom of his father, and in order to get it he went to
search for the Supreme Lord. But he later realized that everything is the creation of the illusory energy.
From the acts of Srila Dhruva Maharaja we can understand that somehow or other if one becomes Krsna
conscious--it does not matter what his motivation is in the beginning--he will eventually realize the real
truth by the grace of the Lord. In the beginning, Dhruva Maharaja was interested in the kingdom of his
father, but later he became a great devotee, maha-bhagavata, and had no interest in material enjoyment.
The perfection of life can be achieved only by devotees. Even if one completes only a minute percentage of
devotional service and then falls down from his immature position, he is better than a person who fully
engages in the fruitive activities of this material world.
