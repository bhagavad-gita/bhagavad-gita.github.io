TRANSLATION
The brahmanas and Vaisnavas are personally glorified by their characteristic powers of tolerance,
penance, knowledge and education. By dint of all these spiritual assets, Vaisnavas are more powerful than
royalty. It is therefore advised that the princely order not exhibit its material prowess before these two
communities and should avoid offending them.
PURPORT
Prthu Maharaja has explained in the previous verse the importance of devotional service for both the
rulers and the citizens of the state. Now he explains how one can be steadily fixed in devotional service.
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, while instructing Srila Rupa Gosvami, has compared the devotional service of
the Lord with a creeper. A creeper has a feeble stem and requires the support of another tree to grow, and
while growing, it requires sufficient protection so that it may not be lost. While describing the system of
protection for the creeper of devotional service, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has especially stressed
protection from offenses unto the lotus feet of Vaisnavas. Such offenses are called vaisnava-aparadha.
Aparadha means "offense." If one commits vaisnava-aparadhas, all of his progress in devotional service
will be checked. Even though one is very much advanced in devotional service, if he commits offenses at
the feet of a Vaisnava, his advancement is all spoiled. In the sastras it is found that a very great yogi,
Durvasa Muni, committed a vaisnava-aparadha and thus for one full year had to travel all over the
universe, even to Vaikunthaloka, to defend himself from the offense. At last, even when he approached
the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vaikuntha, he was refused protection. Therefore one should be
very careful about committing offenses at the feet of a Vaisnava. The most grievous type of vaisnavaaparadha
is called gurv-aparadha, which refers to offenses at the lotus feet of the spiritual master. In the
chanting of the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this gurv-aparadha is considered the
most grievous offense. Guror avajna sruti-sastra-nindanam (Padma Purana). Among the ten offenses
committed against the chanting of the holy name, the first offenses are disobedience of the spiritual
master and blasphemy of the Vedic literature.
The simple definition of Vaisnava is given by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: a person who immediately
reminds one of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is a Vaisnava. In this verse, both Vaisnavas
and brahmanas are mentioned. A Vaisnava is a learned brahmana and is therefore designated as
brahmana-vaisnava, brahmana-pandita or as a Vaisnava and brahmana. In other words, a Vaisnava is
supposed to be a brahmana already, but a brahmana may not be a pure Vaisnava. When a person
understands his pure identity, brahma janati, he immediately becomes a brahmana. In the brahmana
stage, one's understanding of the Absolute Truth is mainly based on the impersonal view. When a
brahmana, however, rises to the platform of personal understanding of the Supreme Godhead, he becomes
a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is transcendental even to a brahmana. In the material conception, the position of a
brahmana is the highest in human society, but a Vaisnava is transcendental even to a brahmana. Both the
brahmana and Vaisnava are spiritually advanced. A brahmana's qualifications are mentioned in Bhagavadgita
as truthfulness, mental equanimity, control of the senses, the power of tolerance, simplicity,
knowledge of the Absolute Truth, firm faith in the scriptures, and practical application of the brahminical
qualities in life. In addition to all these qualifications, when one fully engages in the transcendental loving
service of the Lord, he becomes a Vaisnava. Prthu Maharaja warns his citizens who are actually engaged in
the devotional service of the Lord to take care against offenses to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas. Offenses
at their lotus feet are so destructive that even the descendants of Yadu who were born in the family of
Lord Krsna were destroyed due to offenses at their feet. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot
tolerate any offense at the lotus feet of brahmanas and Vaisnavas. Sometimes, due to their powerful
positions, princes or government servants neglect the position of brahmanas and Vaisnavas, not knowing
that because of their offense they will be ruined.
