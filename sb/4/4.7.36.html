TRANSLATION
The wife of Daksa prayed as follows: My dear Lord, it is very fortunate that You have appeared in this
arena of sacrifice. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, and I request that You be pleased on this
occasion. The sacrificial arena is not beautiful without You, just as a body is not beautiful without the
head.
PURPORT
Another name of Lord Visnu is Yajnesvara. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that all activities should be
performed as Visnu-yajna, for the pleasure of Lord Visnu. Unless we please Him, whatever we do is the
cause of our bondage in the material world. This is confirmed herein by the wife of Daksa: "Without Your
presence, the grandeur of this sacrificial ceremony is useless, just as a body without the head, however
decorated it may be, is useless." The comparison is equally applicable to the social body. Material
civilization is very proud of being advanced, but it is actually the useless trunk of a body without a head.
Without Krsna consciousness, without an understanding of Visnu, the Supreme personality of Godhead,
any advancement in a civilization, no matter how sophisticated, is of no value. There is a statement in the
Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (3.11):
bhagavad-bhakti-hinasya
jatih sastram japas tapah
apranasyaiva dehasya
mandanam loka-ranjanam
The purport is that sometimes when a friend or relative dies, especially among lower class men, the
dead body is decorated. Dressed and ornamented, the body is taken in procession. That sort of decoration
of the dead body has no actual value because the life force is already gone. Similarly, any aristocracy, any
social prestige or any advancement of material civilization without Krsna consciousness is as good as the
decoration of a dead body. The name of the wife of Daksa was Prasuti, and she was the daughter of
Svayambhuva Manu. Her sister, Devahuti, was married to Kardama Muni, and Kapiladeva, the Personality
of Godhead, became her son. Prasuti, then, was the aunt of Lord Visnu. She was asking the favor of Lord
Visnu in an affectionate mode; since she was His aunt, she sought some special favor. Also significant in
this verse is that the Lord is praised with the goddess of fortune. Wherever Lord Visnu is worshiped,
naturally there is the favor of the goddess of fortune. Lord Visnu is addressed as amrta, transcendental.
The demigods, including Brahma and Lord Siva, were produced after the creation, but Lord Visnu existed
before the creation. He is addressed, therefore, as amrta. Lord Visnu is worshiped with His internal energy
by the Vaisnavas. Prasuti, the wife of Daksa, implored the Lord to turn the priests into Vaisnavas instead
of simply fruitive workers performing sacrifices for some material benefits.
