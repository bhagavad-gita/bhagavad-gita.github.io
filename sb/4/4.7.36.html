intolerant; upeyusah--achieved; surucyah--of Queen Suruci; durvacah--harsh words; banaih--by the

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear lord, I am very impudent for not accepting your instructions, but this is not my fault. It is due
to my having been born in a ksatriya family. My stepmother, Suruci, has pierced my heart with her harsh
words. Therefore your valuable instruction does not stand in my heart.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that the heart or mind is just like an earthen pot; once broken, it cannot be repaired by any
means. Dhruva Maharaja gave this example to Narada Muni. He said that his heart, having been pierced
by the arrows of his stepmother's harsh words, felt so broken that nothing seemed valuable but his desire
to counteract her insult. His stepmother had said that because he was born from the womb of Suniti, a
neglected queen of Maharaja Uttanapada, Dhruva Maharaja was not fit to sit either on the throne or on his
father's lap. In other words, according to his stepmother, he could not be declared king. Dhruva
Maharaja's determination, therefore, was to become king of a planet exalted even beyond that possessed
by Lord Brahma, the greatest of all the demigods.
Dhruva Maharaja indirectly informed the great sage Narada that there are four kinds of human spirit--
the brahminical spirit, the ksatriya spirit, the vaisya spirit and the sudra spirit. The spirit of one caste is
not applicable to the members of another. The philosophical spirit enunciated by Narada Muni might
have been suitable for a brahmana spirit, but it was not suitable for a ksatriya. Dhruva frankly admitted
that he was lacking in brahminical humility and was therefore unable to accept the philosophy of Narada
Muni.
The statements of Dhruva Maharaja indicate that unless a child is trained according to his tendency,
there is no possibility of his developing his particular spirit. It was the duty of the spiritual master or
teacher to observe the psychological movement of a particular boy and thus train him in a particular
occupational duty. Dhruva Maharaja, having already been trained in the ksatriya spirit, would not accept
the brahminical philosophy. In America we have practical experience of this incompatibility of the
brahminical and ksatriya temperaments. The American boys, who have simply been trained as sudras, are
not at all fit to fight in battle. Therefore, when they are called to join the military, they refuse because they
do not have ksatriya spirit. This is a cause of great dissatisfaction in society.
That the boys do not have the ksatriya spirit does not mean that they are trained in brahminical
qualities; they are trained as sudras, and thus in frustration they are becoming hippies. However, as soon
as they enter the Krsna consciousness movement being started in America, they are trained to meet the
brahminical qualifications, even though they have fallen to the lowest conditions as sudras. In other
words, since the Krsna consciousness movement is open for everyone, people in general can attain the
brahminical qualifications. This is the greatest need at the present moment, for now there are actually no
brahmanas or ksatriyas but only some vaisyas and, for the most part, sudras. The classification of society
into brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras is very scientific. In the human social body, the brahmanas
are considered the head, the ksatriyas are the arms, the vaisyas are the belly, and the sudras are the legs.
At the present moment the body has legs and a belly, but there are no arms or head, and therefore society
is topsy-turvy. It is necessary to reestablish the brahminical qualifications in order to raise the fallen
human society to the highest standard of spiritual consciousness.
