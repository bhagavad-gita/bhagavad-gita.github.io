narada uvaca
prasna evam hi sanchinno
bhavatah purusarsabha
atra me vadato guhyam
nisamaya suniscitam
SYNONYMS
naradah uvaca--Narada said; prasnah--question; evam--thus; hi--certainly; sanchinnah--answered;
bhavatah--your; purusa-rsabha--O great personality; atra--here; me vadatah--as I am speaking; guhyam--
confidential; nisamaya--hear; su-niscitam--perfectly ascertained.
TRANSLATION
The great saint Narada continued: O great personality, I have replied properly about all that you have
asked me. Now hear another narration that is accepted by saintly persons and is very confidential.
PURPORT
Sri Narada Muni is personally acting as the spiritual master of King Barhisman. It was Narada Muni's
intention that through his instructions the King would immediately give up all engagement in fruitive
activity and take to devotional service. However, although the King understood everything, he was still
not prepared to give up his engagements. As the following verses will show, the King was contemplating
sending for his sons, who were away from home executing austerities and penances. After their return, he
would entrust his kingdom to them and then leave home. This is the position of most people. They accept
a bona fide spiritual master and listen to him, but when the spiritual master indicates that they should
leave home and fully engage in devotional service, they hesitate. The duty of the spiritual master is to
instruct the disciple as long as he does not come to the understanding that this materialistic way of life,
fruitive activity, is not at all beneficial. Actually, one should take to devotional service from the beginning
of life, as Prahlada Maharaja advised: kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan iha (Bhag. 7.6.1).
According to all the instructions of the Vedas, we can understand that unless one takes to Krsna
consciousness and devotional service, he is simply wasting his time engaging in the fruitive activities of
material existence. Narada Muni therefore decided to relate another allegory to the King so that he might
be induced to give up family life within material existence.
