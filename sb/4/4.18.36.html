<h2>Translation</h2>
Just see how Indra, the King of heaven, was creating a disturbance in the midst of the sacrifice by
stealing the sacrificial horse. These attractive sinful activities he has introduced will be carried out by the
people in general.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.21):
yad yad acarati sresthas
tad tad evetaro janah
sa yat pramanam kurute
lokas tad anuvartate
"Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever
standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues."
For his own sense gratification, King Indra thought to defeat Maharaja Prthu in the performance of one
hundred horse sacrifices. Consequently he stole the horse and hid himself amid so many irreligious
personalities, taking on the false guise of a sannyasi. Such activities are attractive to the people in general;
therefore they are dangerous. Lord Brahma thought that instead of allowing Indra to further introduce
such irreligious systems, it would be better to stop the sacrifice. A similar stance was taken by Lord
Buddha when people were overly engrossed in the animal sacrifices recommended by Vedic instructions.
Lord Buddha had to introduce the religion of nonviolence by contradicting the Vedic sacrificial
instructions. Actually, in the sacrifices the slaughtered animals were given a new life, but people without
such powers were taking advantage of such Vedic rituals and unnecessarily killing poor animals.
Therefore Lord Buddha had to deny the authority of the Vedas for the time being. One should not
perform sacrifices that will induce reversed orders. It is better to stop such sacrifices.
As we have repeatedly explained, due to a lack of qualified brahminical priests in Kali-yuga, it is not
possible to perform the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas. Consequently the sastras
instruct us to perform the sankirtana-yajna. By the sankirtana sacrifice, the Supreme personality of
Godhead, in His form of Lord Caitanya, will be satisfied and worshiped. The entire purpose of performing
sacrifices is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu. Lord Visnu, or Lord Krsna, is present
in His form of Lord Caitanya; therefore people who are intelligent should try to satisfy Him by performing
sankirtana-yajna. This is the easiest way to satisfy Lord Visnu in this age. people should take advantage of
the injunctions in different sastras concerning sacrifices in this age and not create unnecessary
disturbances during the sinful age of Kali. In Kali-yuga men all over the world are very expert in opening
slaughterhouses for killing animals, which they eat. If the old ritualistic ceremonies were observed, people
would be encouraged to kill more and more animals. In Calcutta there are many butcher shops which
keep a deity of the goddess Kali, and animal-eaters think it proper to purchase animal flesh from such
shops in hope that they are eating the remnants of food offered to goddess Kali. They do not know that
goddess Kali never accepts nonvegetarian food because she is the chaste wife of Lord Siva. Lord Siva is
also a great Vaisnava and never eats nonvegetarian food, and the goddess Kali accepts the remnants of
food left by Lord Siva. Therefore there is no possibility of her eating flesh or fish. Such offerings are
accepted by the associates of goddess Kali known as bhutas, pisacas and Raksasas, and those who take the
prasada of goddess Kali in the shape of flesh or fish are not actually taking the prasada left by goddess
Kali, but the food left by the bhutas and pisacas.
