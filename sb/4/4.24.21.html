<h2>Text</h2>
kadacid atamana sa
brahma-lokan mahim gatam
vavre brhad-vratam mam tu
janati kama-mohita
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kadacit--once upon a time; atamana--traveling; sa--she; brahma-lokat--from Brahmaloka, the highest
planet; mahim--on the earth; gatam--having come; vavre--she proposed; brhat-vratam--avowed
brahmacari; mam--unto me; tu--then; janati--knowing; kama-mohita--being illusioned by lust.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When I once came to this earth from Brahmaloka, the highest planetary system, the daughter of Time,
wandering over the universe, met me. Knowing me to be an avowed brahmacari, she became lusty and
proposed that I accept her.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great sage Narada Muni was a naisthika-brahmacari--that is, he never had sex life. He was
consequently an ever-green youth. Old age, jara, could not attack him. The invalidity of old age can
overcome an ordinary man, but Narada Muni was different. Taking Narada Muni to be an ordinary man,
the daughter of Time confronted him with her lusty desire. It requires great strength to resist a woman's
attraction. It is difficult for old men, and what to speak of young. Those who live as brahmacaris must
follow in the footsteps of the great sage Narada Muni, who never accepted the proposals of Jara. Those
who are too much sexually addicted become victims of jara, and very soon their life-span is shortened.
Without utilizing the human form of life for Krsna consciousness the victims of jara die very soon in this
world.
