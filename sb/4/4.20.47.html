<h2>Translation</h2>
Similarly, Hiranyakasipu, who by dint of his sinful activities always defied the supremacy of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, entered into the darkest region of hellish life; but by the grace of his
great son, Prahlada Maharaja, he also was delivered and went back home, back to Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Prahlada Maharaja was offered benediction by Nrsimhadeva, due to his great devotion and
tolerance he refused to accept any benediction from the Lord, thinking that such acceptance was not
befitting a sincere devotee. The rendering of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in expectation
of a good reward is deprecated by Prahlada Maharaja as mercantile business. Because Prahlada Maharaja
was a Vaisnava, he did not ask a benediction for his personal self but was very affectionate toward his
father. Although his father tortured him and would have killed him had he himself not been killed by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahlada Maharaja begged pardon for him from the Lord. This favor
was immediately granted by the Lord, and Hiranyakasipu was delivered from the darkest region of hellish
life, and he returned back home, back to Godhead, by the grace of his son. Prahlada Maharaja is the
topmost example of a Vaisnava, who is always compassionate toward sinful persons suffering a hellish life
within this material world. Krsna is therefore known as para-duhkha-duhkhi krpambudhih, or one who is
compassionate toward others' suffering and who is an ocean of mercy. Like Prahlada Maharaja, all pure
devotees of the Lord come to this material world with full compassion to deliver the sinful. They undergo
all kinds of tribulations, suffering them with tolerance, because that is another qualification of a Vaisnava,
who tries to deliver all sinful persons from the hellish conditions of material existence. Vaisnavas are
therefore offered the following prayer:
vancha-kalpatarubhyas ca
krpa-sindhubhya eva ca
patitanam pavanebhyo
vaisnavebhyo namo namah
The chief concern of a Vaisnava is to deliver the fallen souls.
