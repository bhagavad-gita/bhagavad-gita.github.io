<h2>Text</h2>
nayam margo hi sadhunam
hrsikesanuvartinam
yad atmanam parag grhya
pasuvad bhuta-vaisasam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--never; ayam--this; margah--path; hi--certainly; sadhunam--of honest persons; hrsikesa--of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; anuvartinam--following the path; yat--which; atmanam--self; parak--the
body; grhya--thinking to be; pasu-vat--like animals; bhuta--of living entities; vaisasam--killing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One should not accept the body as the self and thus, like the animals, kill the bodies of others. This is
especially forbidden by saintly persons, who follow the path of devotional service to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words sadhunam hrsikesanuvartinam are very significant. Sadhu means "a saintly person." But who
is a saintly person? A saintly person is he who follows the path of rendering service unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hrsikesa. In the Narada-pancaratra it is said, hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir
ucyate: the process of rendering favorable service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead with one's
senses is called bhakti, or devotional service. Therefore, why should a person who is already engaged in
the service of the Lord engage himself in personal sense gratification? Dhruva Maharaja is advised here by
Lord Manu that he is a pure servitor of the Lord. Why should he unnecessarily engage, like the animals,
in the bodily concept of life? An animal thinks that the body of another animal is his food; therefore, in
the bodily concept of life, one animal attacks another. A human being, especially one who is a devotee of
the Lord, should not act like this. A sadhu, a saintly devotee, is not supposed to kill animals
unnecessarily.
