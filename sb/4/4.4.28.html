<h2>Text</h2>
tat pasyatam khe bhuvi cadbhutam mahad
ha heti vadah sumahan ajayata
hanta priya daivatamasya devi

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

wonderful; mahat--great; ha ha--oh, oh; iti--thus; vadah--roar; su-mahan--tumultuous; ajayata--occurred;
hanta--alas; priya--the beloved; daiva-tamasya--of the most respectable demigod (Lord Siva); devi--Sati;
jahau--quit; asun--her life; kena--by Daksa; sati--Sati; prakopita--angered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Sati annihilated her body in anger, there was a tumultuous roar all over the universe. Why had
Sati, the wife of the most respectable demigod, Lord Siva, quit her body in such a manner?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There was a tumultuous roaring all over the universe in the societies of the demigods of different
planets because Sati was the daughter of Daksa, the greatest of all kings, and the wife of Lord Siva, the
greatest of all demigods. Why did she become so angry that she gave up her body? Since she was the
daughter of a great personality and wife of a great personality, she had nothing to desire, but still she gave
up her body in dissatisfaction. Certainly this was astonishing. One cannot attain complete satisfaction
even if one is situated in the greatest material opulence. There was nothing Sati could not achieve either
from her relationship with her father or from her relationship with the greatest of the demigods, but still,
for some reason, she was dissatisfied. Therefore, Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6) explains that one has to
achieve real satisfaction (yayatma suprasidati), but atma--the body, mind and soul--all become completely
satisfied only if one develops devotional service to the Absolute Truth. Sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato
bhaktir adhoksaje. Adhoksaja means the Absolute Truth. If one can develop his unflinching love for the
transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can give complete satisfaction, otherwise there is no
possibility of satisfaction in the material world or anywhere else.
