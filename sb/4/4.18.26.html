<h2>Text</h2>
tad abhijnaya bhagavan
prthuh prthu-parakramah
indraya kupito banam
adattodyata-karmukah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--that; abhijnaya--understanding; bhagavan--the incarnation of Godhead; prthuh--King Prthu; prthuparakramah--
celebrated as very powerful; indraya--upon Indra; kupitah--being very angry; banam--an
arrow; adatta--took up; udyata--having taken up; karmukah--the bow.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Prthu, who was celebrated as very powerful, immediately took up his bow and arrows and
prepared to kill Indra himself, because Indra had introduced such irregular sannyasa orders.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is the duty of the king not to tolerate the introduction of any irreligious systems. Since King Prthu
was an incarnation of the Supreme personality of Godhead, certainly his duty was to cut down all kinds of
irreligious systems. Following in his footsteps, all heads of state should themselves be bona fide
representatives of God and should cut down all irreligious systems. Unfortunately they are cowards who
declare a secular state. Such a mentality is a way of compromising religious and irreligious systems, but
because of this citizens are generally becoming uninterested in spiritual advancement. Thus the situation
deteriorates to such an extent that human society becomes hellish.
