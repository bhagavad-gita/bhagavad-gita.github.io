<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes you think yourself a man, sometimes a chaste woman and sometimes a neutral eunuch. This
is all because of the body, which is created by the illusory energy. This illusory energy is My potency, and
actually both of us--you and I--are pure spiritual identities. Now just try to understand this. I am trying to
explain our factual position.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The factual position of both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity is qualitatively
one. The Supreme Lord is the Supreme Spirit, the Supersoul, and the living entity is the individual
spiritual soul. Even though both of them are original spiritual identities, the living entity forgets his
identity when he comes in contact with material nature and becomes conditioned. At such a time he
identifies himself as a product of the material nature. Because of the material body, he forgets that he is
the eternal (sanatana) part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in this
way: mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah. The word sanatana is found in several places in
Bhagavad-gita. Both the Lord and the living entity are sanatana (eternal), and there is also a place known
as sanatana, beyond this material nature. The real residence of both the living entity and God is the
domain of sanatana, not this material world. The material world is the temporary, external energy of the
Lord, and the living entity is placed in this material world because he wanted to imitate the position of the
Supreme personality of Godhead. In this material world he tries to enjoy his senses to his best capacity.
All the activities of the conditioned soul within this material world are perpetually taking place in
different types of bodies, but when the living entity acquires developed consciousness, he should try to
rectify his situation and again become a member of the spiritual world. The process by which one can
return home, back to Godhead, is bhakti-yoga, sometimes called sanatana-dharma. Instead of accepting a
temporary occupational duty based on the material body, one should take to the process of sanatanadharma,
or bhakti-yoga, so that he can put an end to this perpetual bondage in material bodies and return
home, back to Godhead. As long as human society works on the basis of false material identification, all
the so-called advancements of science and philosophy are simply useless. They only serve to mislead
human society. Andha yathandhair upaniyamanah. In the material world, the blind simply lead the blind.
