TRANSLATION
While traveling, the Pracetas happened to see a great reservoir of water which seemed almost as big as
the ocean. The water of this lake was so calm and quiet that it seemed like the mind of a great soul, and its
inhabitants, the aquatics, appeared very peaceful and happy to be under the protection of such a watery
reservoir.
PURPORT
The word sa-samudra means "near the sea." The reservoir of water was like a bay, for it was not very far
from the sea. The word upa, meaning "more or less," is used in many ways, as in the word upapati, which
indicates a husband "more or less," that is to say, a lover who is acting like a husband. Upa also means
"greater," "smaller" or "nearer." Considering all these points, the reservoir of water which was seen by the
Pracetas while they were traveling was actually a large bay or lake. And unlike the sea or ocean, which has
turbulent waves, this reservoir was very calm and quiet. Indeed, the water was so clear that it seemed like
the mind of some great soul. There may be many great souls--jnanis, yogis and bhaktas, or pure devotees,
are also called great souls--but they are very rarely found. One can find many great souls amongst yogis
and jnanis, but a truly great soul, a pure devotee of the Lord, who is fully surrendered to the Lord, is very
rarely found (sa mahatma sudurlabhah, Bg. 7.19). A devotee's mind is always calm, quiet and desireless
because he is always anyabhilasita-sunyam, having no desire other than to serve Krsna as His personal
servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover. Due to his association with Krsna, a devotee is always
very calm and cool. It is also significant that within that reservoir all the aquatics were also very calm and
quiet. Because the disciples of a devotee have taken shelter of a great soul, they become very calm and
quiet and are not agitated by the waves of the material world.
This material world is often described as an ocean of nescience. In such an ocean, everything is agitated.
The mind of a great devotee is also like an ocean or a very large lake, but there is no agitation. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (2.41): vyavasayatmika buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana. Those who are fixed in the service of
the Lord are not agitated by anything. It is also stated in Bhagavad-gita (6.22): yasmin sthito na duhkhena
gurunapi vicalyate. Even if he suffers some reversals in life, a devotee is never agitated. Therefore whoever
takes shelter of a great soul or a great devotee becomes pacified. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya
19.149) it is stated: krsna-bhakta--niskama, ataeva 'santa.' A devotee of Lord Krsna is always peaceful
because he has no desire, whereas the yogis, karmis and jnanis have so many desires to fulfill. One may
argue that the devotees have desires, for they wish to go home, back to Godhead, but such a desire does
not agitate the mind. Although he wishes to go back to Godhead, a devotee is satisfied in any condition of
life. Consequently, the word mahan-manah is used in this verse to indicate that the reservoir of water was
as calm and quiet as the mind of a great devotee.
