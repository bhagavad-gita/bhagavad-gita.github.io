<h2>Text</h2>
sayanam imam utsrjya
svasantam puruso yatha
karmatmany ahitam bhunkte

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sayanam--lying down on a bed; imam--this body; utsrjya--after giving up; svasantam--breathing;
purusah--the living entity; yatha--as; karma--activity; atmani--in the mind; ahitam--executed; bhunkte--
enjoys; tadrsena--by a similar body; itarena--by a different body; va--or.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity, while dreaming, gives up the actual living body. Through the activities of his mind
and intelligence, he acts in another body, either as a god or a dog. After giving up this gross body, the
living entity enters either an animal body or a demigod's body on this planet or on another planet. He
thus enjoys the results of the actions of his past life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although the root of distress and happiness is the mind, intelligence and ego, a gross body is still
required as an instrument for enjoyment. The gross body may change, but the subtle body continues to
act. Unless the living entity gets another gross body, he will have to continue in a subtle body, or a ghostly
body. One becomes a ghost when the subtle body acts without the help of the instrumental gross body. As
stated in this verse, sayanam imam utsrjya svasantam. The gross body may lie on a bed and rest, and even
though the machinery of the gross body is working, the living entity may leave, go into a dream, and
return to the gross body. When he returns to the body, he forgets his dream. Similarly, when the living
entity takes on another gross body, he forgets the present gross body. The conclusion is that the subtle
body--mind, intelligence and ego--creates an atmosphere with desires and ambitions that the living entity
enjoys in the subtle body. Actually the living entity is in the subtle body, even though the gross body
apparently changes and even though he inhabits the gross body on various planets. All the activities
performed by the living entity in the subtle body are called illusory because they are not permanent.
Liberation means getting out of the clutches of the subtle body. Liberation from the gross body simply
involves the transmigration of the soul from one gross body to another. When the mind is educated in
Krsna consciousness, or higher consciousness in the mode of goodness, one is transferred either to the
upper, heavenly planets or to the spiritual world, the Vaikuntha planets. One therefore has to change his
consciousness by cultivating knowledge received from Vedic instructions from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead through the disciplic succession. If we train the subtle body in this life by always thinking about
Krsna, we will transfer to Krsnaloka after leaving the gross body. This is confirmed by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." (Bg. 4.9)
Thus the change of the gross body is not very important, but the change of the subtle body is important.
The Krsna consciousness movement is educating people to enlighten the subtle body. The perfect
example in this regard is Ambarisa Maharaja, who always engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord
Krsna. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. Similarly, in this life we should always fix our mind on the
lotus feet of Krsna, who is present in His arca-vigraha, the incarnation of the Deity in the temple. We
should also always engage in His worship. If we engage our speech in describing the activities of the Lord
and our ears in hearing about His pastimes, and if we follow the regulative principles to keep the mind
intact for advancing in Krsna consciousness, we shall certainly be elevated to the spiritual platform. Then
at the time of death the mind, intelligence and ego will no longer be materially contaminated. The living
entity is present, and the mind, intelligence and ego are also present. When the mind, intelligence and ego
are purified, all the active senses of the living entity become spiritual. Thus the living entity attains his
sac-cid-ananda form. The Supreme Lord is always in His sac-cid-ananda form, but the living entity,
although part and parcel of the Lord, becomes materially contaminated when he desires to come to the
material world for material enjoyment. The prescription for returning home, back to Godhead, is given by
the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.34):
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi yuktvaivam
atmanam mat-parayanah
"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Being
completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me."
