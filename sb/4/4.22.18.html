<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva, the most powerful demigod, second only to Lord Visnu, is self-sufficient. Although he has
nothing to aspire for in the material world, for the benefit of those in the material world he is always
busily engaged everywhere and is accompanied by his dangerous energies like goddess Kali and goddess
Durga.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva is known as the greatest devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is known as the
best of all types of Vaisnavas (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh). Consequently, Lord Siva has a Vaisnava
sampradaya, the disciplic succession known as the Rudra-sampradaya. Just as there is a Brahmasampradaya
coming directly from Lord Brahma, the Rudra-sampradaya comes directly from Lord Siva.
Lord Siva is one of the twelve great personalities, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (6.3.20):
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
These are twelve great authorities in preaching God consciousness. The name Sambhu means Lord Siva.
His disciplic succession is also known as the Visnusvami-sampradaya, and the current Visnusvamisampradaya
is also known as the Vallabha-sampradaya. The current Brahma-sampradaya is known as the
Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya. Even though Lord Siva appeared to preach Mayavada philosophy, at the
end of his pastime in the form of Sankaracarya, he preached the Vaisnava philosophy: bhaja govindam
bhaja govindam bhaja govindam mudha-mate. He stressed worshiping Lord Krsna, or Govinda, three
times in this verse and especially warned his followers that they could not possibly achieve deliverance, or
mukti, simply by word jugglery and grammatical puzzles. If one is actually serious to attain mukti, he
must worship Lord Krsna. That is Sripada Sankaracarya's last instruction.
Herein it is mentioned that Lord Siva is always accompanied by his material energy (saktya ghoraya).
Material energy--goddess Durga, or goddess Kali--is always under his control. Goddess Kali and Durga
serve him by killing all the asuras, or demons. Sometimes Kali becomes so infuriated that she
indiscriminately kills all kinds of asuras. There is a popular picture of goddess Kali in which she wears a
garland composed of the heads of the asuras and holds in her left hand a captured head and in her right
hand a great khadga, or chopper, for killing asuras. Great wars are symbolic representations of Kali's
devastation of the asuras and are actually conducted by the goddess Kali.
srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka
(Brahma-samhita 5.44)
Asuras try to pacify the goddess Kali, or Durga, by worshiping her in material opulence, but when the
asuras become too intolerable, goddess Kali does not discriminate in killing them wholesale. Asuras do
not know the secret of the energy of Lord Siva, and they prefer to worship goddess Kali or Durga or Lord
Siva for material benefit. Due to their demoniac character, they are reluctant to surrender to Lord Krsna,
as indicated by Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
Lord Siva's duty is very dangerous because he has to employ the energy of goddess Kali (or Durga). In
another popular picture the goddess Kali is sometimes seen standing on the prostrate body of Lord Siva,
which indicates that sometimes Lord Siva has to fall down flat in order to stop goddess Kali from killing
the asuras. Since Lord Siva controls the great material energy (goddess Durga), worshipers of Lord Siva
attain very opulent positions within this material world. Under Lord Siva's direction, a worshiper of Lord
Siva gets all kinds of material facilities. In contrast, a Vaisnava, or worshiper of Lord Visnu, gradually
becomes poorer in material possessions because Lord Visnu does not trick His devotees into becoming
materially entangled by possessions. Lord Visnu gives His devotees intelligence from within, as stated in
Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me."
Thus Lord Visnu gives intelligence to His devotee so that the devotee can make progress on the path
back home, back to Godhead. Since a devotee has nothing to do with any kind of material possession, he
does not come under the control of goddess Kali, or the goddess Durga.
Lord Siva is also in charge of the tamo-guna, or the mode of ignorance in this material world. His
potency, the goddess Durga, is described as keeping all living entities in the darkness of ignorance (ya
devi sarva-bhutesu nidra-rupam samsthita). Both Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are incarnations of Lord
Visnu, but Lord Brahma is in charge of the creation whereas Lord Siva is in charge of the destruction,
which he carries out with the help of his material energy, goddess Kali, or goddess Durga. Thus in this
verse Lord Siva is described as being accompanied by dangerous potencies (saktya ghoraya), and that is
the actual position of Lord Siva.
