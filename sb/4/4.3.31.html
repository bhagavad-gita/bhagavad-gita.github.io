TRANSLATION
The Vedas give the eternal regulative principles for auspicious advancement in human civilization
which have been rigidly followed in the past. The strong evidence of this principle is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is called Janardana, the well-wisher of all living entities.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, has claimed that He is the father of all
living entities, regardless of form. There are 8,400,000 different species of life forms, and Lord Krsna
claims that He is the father of all. Because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, they are all sons of the Lord, and for their benefit, because they are hovering
under the impression that they can lord it over material nature, the Vedas are given to them for their
guidance. Therefore the Vedas are called apauruseya, for they are not written by any man or demigod,
including the first living creature, Brahma. Brahma is not the creator or author of the Vedas. He is also
one of the living beings in this material world; therefore he does not have the power to write or speak the
Vedas independently. Every living entity within this material world is subject to four deficiencies: he
commits mistakes, he accepts one thing for another, he cheats, and he has imperfect senses. The Vedas,
however, are not written by any living creature within this material world. Therefore they are said to be
apauruseya. No one can trace out the history of the Vedas. Of course, modern human civilization has no
chronological history of the world or the universe, and it cannot present actual historical facts older than
three thousand years. But no one has traced out when the Vedas were written, because they were never
written by any living being within this material world. All other systems of knowledge are defective
because they have been written or spoken by men or demigods who are products of this material creation,
but Bhagavad-gita is apauruseya, for it was not spoken by any human being or any demigod of this
material creation; it was spoken by Lord Krsna, who is beyond the material creation. That is accepted by
such stalwart scholars as Sankaracarya, not to speak of other acaryas such as Ramanujacarya and
Madhvacarya. Sankaracarya has accepted that Narayana and Krsna are transcendental, and in Bhagavadgita
also Lord Krsna has established, aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate: "I am the origin
of everything; everything emanates from Me." This material creation, including Brahma and Siva and all
the demigods, has been created by Him, for everything has emanated from Him. He also says that the
purpose of all the Vedas is to understand Him (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). He is the original
veda-vit, or knower of the Vedas, and vedanta-krt, or compiler of Vedanta. Brahma is not the compiler of
the Vedas.
In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is established, tene brahma hrda: the Supreme Absolute
Truth, the Personality of Godhead, instructed Brahma in the Vedic knowledge through his heart.
Therefore the evidence that Vedic knowledge is free from the defects of mistakes, illusions, cheating and
imperfection is that it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janardana, and has thus been
followed from time immemorial, beginning from Brahma. The Vedic religion or the principles of the
Vedas have been followed by the highly cultured population of India since time immemorial; no one can
trace out the history of Vedic religion. Therefore it is sanatana, and any blasphemy against the Vedas is
calculated to be atheism. The Vedas are described as setu, which means "a bridge." If one wants to attain
his spiritual existence, one has to cross an ocean of nescience. The Vedas are the bridge by which to cross
such a great ocean.
The Vedas describe how to divide the human race into four divisions according to quality and working
capacity. This is a very scientific system, and it is also sanatana, for no one can trace out its history and it
has no dissolution. No one can stop the system of varna and asrama, or the castes and divisions. For
example, whether or not one accepts the name brahmana, there is a class in society which is known as the
intelligent class and which is interested in spiritual understanding and philosophy. Similarly, there is a
class of men who are interested in administration and in ruling others. In the Vedic system these martially
spirited men are called ksatriyas. Similarly, everywhere there is a class of men who are interested in
economic development, business, industry and money-making; they are called vaisyas. And there is
another class who are neither intelligent nor martially spirited nor endowed with the capacity for
economic development but who simply can serve others. They are called sudras, or the laborer class. This
system is sanatana--it comes from time immemorial, and it will continue in the same way. There is no
power in the world which can stop it. Therefore, since this sanatana-dharma system is eternal, one can
elevate himself to the highest standard of spiritual life by following the Vedic principles.
It is stated that formerly the sages followed this system; therefore to follow the Vedic system is to follow
the standard etiquette of society. But the followers of Lord Siva, who are drunkards, who are addicted to
intoxicants and sex life, who do not bathe and who smoke ganja, are against all human etiquette. The
conclusion is that persons who rebel against the Vedic principles are themselves the evidence that the
Vedas are authoritative, because by not following the Vedic principles they become like animals. Such
animalistic persons are themselves evidence of the supremacy of the Vedic regulations.
