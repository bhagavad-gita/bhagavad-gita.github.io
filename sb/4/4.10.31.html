<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhruva Maharaja was a liberated soul, and actually he was not angry with anyone. But because he was
the ruler, it was his duty to become angry for some time in order to keep law and order in the state. His
brother, Uttama, was without fault, yet he was killed by one of the Yaksas. It was the duty of Dhruva
Maharaja to kill the offender (life for life) because Dhruva was the king. When the challenge came,
Dhruva Maharaja fought vehemently and punished the Yaksas sufficiently. But anger is such that if one
increases it, it increases unlimitedly. In order that Dhruva Maharaja's kingly anger not exceed the limit,
Manu was kind enough to check his grandson. Dhruva Maharaja could understand the purpose of his
grandfather, and he immediately stopped the fighting. The words srutena bhuyasa, "by constantly
hearing," are very important in this verse. By constantly hearing about devotional service, one can check
the force of anger, which is detrimental to the process of devotional service. Srila Pariksit Maharaja said
that the constant hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is the panacea for all material diseases. Everyone,
therefore, should hear about the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. By hearing one can always
remain in equilibrium, and thus his progress in spiritual life will not be hampered.
Dhruva Maharaja's becoming angry with the miscreants was quite appropriate. There is a short story in
this connection about a snake who became a devotee upon instruction by Narada, who instructed him not
to bite anymore. Since ordinarily a snake's business is to fatally bite other living entities, as a devotee he
was forbidden to do so. Unfortunately, people took advantage of this nonviolence on the part of the
snake, especially the children, who began to throw stones at him. He did not bite anyone, however,
because it was the instruction of his spiritual master. After a while, when the snake met his spiritual
master, Narada, he complained, "I have given up the bad habit of biting innocent living entities, but they
are mistreating me by throwing stones at me." Upon hearing this, Narada Muni instructed him, "Don't
bite, but do not forget to expand your hood as if you were going to bite. Then they will go away."
Similarly, a devotee is always nonviolent; he is qualified with all good characteristics. But, in the common
world, when there is mischief made by others, he should not forget to become angry, at least for the time
being, in order to drive away the miscreants.
