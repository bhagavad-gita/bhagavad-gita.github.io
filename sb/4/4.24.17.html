rama ucuh
nara-natha na janimas
tvat-priya yad vyavasyati
bhutale niravastare
sayanam pasya satru-han
SYNONYMS
ramah ucuh--the women thus spoke; nara-natha--O King; na janimah--we do not know; tvat-priya--your
beloved; yat vyavasyati--why she has taken to this sort of life; bhu-tale--on the ground; niravastare--
without bedding; sayanam--lying down; pasya--look; satru-han--O killer of enemies.
TRANSLATION
All the women addressed the King: O master of the citizens, we do not know why your dear wife has
taken on this sort of existence. O killer of enemies, kindly look! She is lying on the ground without
bedding. We cannot understand why she is acting this way.
PURPORT
When a person is devoid of devotional service, or visnu-bhakti, he takes to many sinful activities. King
Puranjana left home, neglected his own wife and engaged himself in killing animals. This is the position
of all materialistic men. They do not care for a married chaste wife. They take the wife only as an
instrument for sense enjoyment, not as a means for devotional service. To have unrestricted sex life, the
karmis work very hard. They have concluded that the best course is to have sex with any woman and
simply pay the price for her, as though she were a mercantile commodity. Thus they engage their energy
in working very hard for such material acquisitions. Such materialistic people have lost their good
intelligence. They must search out their intelligence within the heart. A person who does not have a
chaste wife accepted by religious principles always has a bewildered intelligence.
The wife of King Puranjana was lying on the ground because she was neglected by her husband.
Actually the woman must always be protected by her husband. We always speak of the goddess of fortune
as being placed on the chest of Narayana. In other words, the wife must remain embraced by her husband.
Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as one saves his money and places it under his own
personal protection, one should similarly protect his wife by his own personal supervision. Just as
intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved chaste wife should always have her place on the chest
of a good husband. This is the proper relationship between husband and wife. A wife is therefore called
ardhangani, or half of the body. One cannot remain with only one leg, one hand or only one side of the
body. He must have two sides. Similarly, according to nature's way, husband and wife should live
together. In the lower species of life, among birds and animals, it is seen that by nature's arrangement the
husband and wife live together. It is similarly ideal in human life for the husband and wife to live
together. The home should be a place for devotional service, and the wife should be chaste and accepted
by a ritualistic ceremony. In this way one can become happy at home.
