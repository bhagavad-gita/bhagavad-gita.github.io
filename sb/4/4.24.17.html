<h2>Text</h2>
ksiyamane sva-sambandhe
ekasmin bahubhir yudha
cintam param jagamartah
sa-rastra-pura-bandhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ksiyamane--when he became weak; sva-sambandhe--his intimate friend; ekasmin--alone; bahubhih--
with many warriors; yudha--by battle; cintam--anxiety; param--very great; jagama--obtained; artah--being
aggrieved; sa--along with; rastra--of the kingdom; pura--of the city; bandhavah--friends and relatives.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because he had to fight alone with so many soldiers, all of whom were great warriors, the serpent with
five hoods became very weak. Seeing that his most intimate friend was weakening, King Puranjana and his
friends and citizens living within the city all became very anxious.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entity resides within the body and struggles for existence with the limbs of the body, which
are referred to here as citizens and friends. One can struggle alone with many soldiers for some time, but
not for all time. The living entity within the body can struggle up to the limit of a hundred years with
good luck, but after that it is not possible to prolong the struggle. Thus the living entity submits and falls
victim. In this regard, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung: vrddha kala aola saba sukha bhagala. When
one becomes old, it becomes impossible to enjoy material happiness. Generally people think that religion
and piety come at the end of life, and at this time one generally becomes meditative and takes to some socalled
yogic process to relax in the name of meditation. Meditation, however, is simply a farce for those
who have enjoyed life in sense gratification. As described in the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita,
meditation (dhyana, dharana) is a difficult subject matter that one has to learn from his very youth. To
meditate, one must restrain himself from all kinds of sense gratification. Unfortunately, meditation has
now become a fashion for those who are overly addicted to sensual things. Such meditation is defeated by
the struggle for existence. Sometimes such meditative processes pass for transcendental meditation. King
Puranjana, the living entity, being thus victimized by the hard struggle for existence, took to
transcendental meditation with his friends and relatives.
