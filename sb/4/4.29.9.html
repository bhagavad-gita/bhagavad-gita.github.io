ayuh--span of life; tat--that; manah--mind; vacah--words; nrnam--of human beings; yena--by which; hi--

TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada said: When a living entity is born to engage in the devotional service of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme controller, his birth, all his fruitive activities, his
life-span, his mind and his words are all factually perfect.
PURPORT
In this verse the word nrnam is very important. There are many other births besides human birth, but
Narada Muni is herein especially speaking of human birth. Among human beings there are different types
of men. Of these, those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, are called
Aryans. Among Aryans, one who engages in the devotional service of the Lord is most successful in life.
The word nrnam indicates that lower animals are not expected to engage in the devotional service of the
Lord. But in perfect human society everyone should engage in the devotional service of the Lord. It does
not matter whether one is born poor or rich, black or white. There may be so many material distinctions
for one who takes birth in human society, but everyone should engage in the Lord's devotional service. At
the present moment civilized nations have given up God consciousness for economic development. They
are actually no longer interested in advancing in God consciousness. Formerly their forefathers were
engaged in executing religious principles. Whether one is Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish or whatever,
everyone has some religious institution. Real religion, however, means becoming God conscious. It is
particularly mentioned herein that birth is successful if an interest in Krsna consciousness is taken.
Activity is successful if it results in serving the Lord. Philosophical speculation or mental speculation is
successful when engaged in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The senses are worth
possessing when engaged in the service of the Lord. Actually, devotional service means engaging the
senses in the service of the Lord. At the present moment our senses are not purified; therefore our senses
are engaged in the service of society, friendship, love, politics, sociology and so on. However, when the
senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, one attains bhakti, or devotional service. In the next verse
these matters will be more clearly explained.
When one great devotee of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu saw the Lord, he said that all his desires were
fulfilled. He said, "Today everything is auspicious. Today my birthplace and neighborhood are completely
glorified. Today my senses, from my eyes down to my toes, are fortunate. Today my life is successful
because I have been able to see the lotus feet that are worshiped by the goddess of fortune."
