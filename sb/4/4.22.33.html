<h2>Text</h2>
arthendriyarthabhidhyanam
sarvarthapahnavo nrnam
bhramsito jnana-vijnanad
yenavisati mukhyatam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
artha--riches; indriya-artha--for the satisfaction of the senses; abhidhyanam--constantly thinking of;
sarva-artha--four kinds of achievements; apahnavah--destructive; nrnam--of human society; bhramsitah--
being devoid of; jnana--knowledge; vijnanat--devotional service; yena--by all this; avisati--enters;
mukhyatam--immovable life.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For human society, constantly thinking of how to earn money and apply it for sense gratification brings
about the destruction of everyone's interests. When one becomes devoid of knowledge and devotional
service, he enters into species of life like those of trees and stones.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Jnana, or knowledge, means to understand one's constitutional position, and vijnana refers to practical
application of that knowledge in life. In the human form of life, one should come to the position of jnana
and vijnana, but despite this great opportunity if one does not develop knowledge and practical
application of knowledge through the help of a spiritual master and the sastras--in other words, if one
misuses this opportunity--then in the next life he is sure to be born in a species of nonmoving living
entities. Nonmoving living entities include hills, mountains, trees, plants, etc. This stage of life is called
punyatam or mukhyatam, namely, making all activities zero. Philosophers who support stopping all
activities are called sunyavadi. By nature's own way, our activities are to be gradually diverted to
devotional service. But there are philosophers who, instead of purifying their activities, try to make
everything zero, or void of all activities. This lack of activity is represented by the trees and the hills. This
is a kind of punishment inflicted by the laws of nature. If we do not properly execute our mission of life in
self-realization, nature's punishment will render us inactive by putting us in the form of trees and hills.
Therefore activities directed toward sense gratification are condemned herein. One who is constantly
thinking of activities to earn money and gratify the senses is following a path which is suicidal. Factually
all human society is following this path. Some way or other, people are determined to earn money or get
money by begging, borrowing or stealing and applying that for sense gratification. Such a civilization is
the greatest obstacle in the path of self-realization.
