<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
hitva grhan sutan bhogan
vaidarbhi madireksana
anvadhavata pandyesam
jyotsneva rajani-karam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hitva--giving up; grhan--home; sutan--children; bhogan--material happiness; vaidarbhi--the daughter of
King Vidarbha; madira-iksana--with enchanting eyes; anvadhavata--followed; pandya-isam--King
Malayadhvaja; jyotsna iva--like the moonshine; rajani-karam--the moon.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as the moonshine follows the moon at night, immediately after King Malayadhvaja departed for
Kulacala, his devoted wife, whose eyes were very enchanting, followed him, giving up all homely
happiness, despite family and children.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Just as in the vanaprastha stage the wife follows the husband, similarly when the spiritual master retires
for nirjana-bhajana, some of his advanced devotees follow him and engage in his personal service. In
other words, those who are very fond of family life should come forward in the service of the spiritual
master and abandon so-called happiness afforded by society, friendship and love. A verse by Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura in his Gurv-astaka is significant in this regard. Yasya prasadad bhagavatprasadah.
A disciple should always remember that by serving the spiritual master he can easily advance in
Krsna consciousness. All the scriptures recommend that it is by pleasing the spiritual master and serving
him directly that one can attain the highest perfectional stage of devotional service.
The word madireksana is also significant in this verse. Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained in his Sandarbha
that the word madira means "intoxicating." If one's eyes become intoxicated upon seeing the Deity, he
may be called madireksana. Queen Vaidarbhi's eyes were very enchanting, just as one's eyes are
madireksana when engaged in seeing the temple Deity. Unless one is an advanced devotee, he cannot fix
his eyes on the Deity in the temple.
