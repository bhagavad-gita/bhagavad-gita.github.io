TRANSLATION
My dear highly glorified Lord, if one, in the association of pure devotees, hears even once the glories of
Your activities, he does not, unless he is nothing but an animal, give up the association of devotees, for no
intelligent person would be so careless as to leave their association. The perfection of chanting and
hearing about Your glories was accepted even by the goddess of fortune, who desired to hear of Your
unlimited activities and transcendental glories.
PURPORT
The association of devotees (arya-sangama) is the most important factor in this world. The word arya
refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the Aryan family is
considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The
Aryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-Aryan. In prehistoric days all of the
members of the Aryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually
advanced. The kings, known as rajarsis, were so perfectly educated as ksatriyas, or protectors of the
citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens.
The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the Aryan family. Although
there is no bar for others, the members of the Aryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life.
How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread Krsna consciousness among the Europeans and
Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were
anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of
material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost
their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the Aryan family
are taking this Krsna consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and
hearing the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming
captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when
chanted among Aryans, but even though one does not belong to the Aryan family, he will become a
Vaisnava simply by hearing the mantra because the vibration has great influence over everyone.
Maharaja Prthu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord
Narayana, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord's glories, and for the association of the gopis, who
are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may
ask why one should bother chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra continually for so many years instead
of stopping and trying for kaivalya, liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer,
Maharaja Prthu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the
process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental
vibration by chance. Prthu Maharaja is very emphatic in this connection--only an animal can give up the
practice of chanting Hare Krsna. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human,
civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna,
Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
