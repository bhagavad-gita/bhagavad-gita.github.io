<h2>Translation</h2>
King Puranjana said: My dear beautiful wife, when a master accepts a servant as his own man, but does
not punish him for his offenses, the servant must be considered unfortunate.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Vedic civilization, domestic animals and servants are treated exactly like one's own
children. Animals and children are sometimes punished not out of vengeance but out of love. Similarly, a
master sometimes punishes his servant, not out of vengeance but out of love, to correct him and bring
him to the right point. Thus King Puranjana took his punishment dealt by his wife, the Queen, as mercy
upon him. He considered himself the most obedient servant of the Queen. She was angry at him for his
sinful activities--namely, hunting in the forest and leaving her at home. King Puranjana accepted the
punishment as actual love and affection from his wife. In the same way, when a person is punished by the
laws of nature, by the will of God, he should not be disturbed. A real devotee thinks in this way. When a
devotee is put into an awkward position, he takes it as the mercy of the Supreme Lord.
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
(Bhag. 10.14.8)
This verse states that the devotee accepts a reversal of his position in life as a benediction by the Lord
and consequently offers the Lord more obeisances and prayers, thinking that the punishment is due to his
past misdeeds and that the Lord is punishing him very mildly. The punishment awarded by the state or by
God for one's own faults is actually for one's benefit. In the Manu-samhita it is said that the King should
be considered merciful when he condemns a murderer to death because a murderer punished in this life
becomes freed from his sinful activity and in the next life takes birth cleared of all sins. If one accepts
punishment as a reward dealt by the master, he becomes intelligent enough not to commit the same
mistake again.
