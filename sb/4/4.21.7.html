SYNONYMS
sah--King Prthu; evam--thus; adini--from the very beginning; anavadya--magnanimous; cestitah--
performing various works; karmani--work; bhuyamsi--repeatedly; mahan--great; mahat-tamah--greater
than the greatest; kurvan--performing; sasasa--ruled; avani-mandalam--the surface of the earth; yasah--
reputation; sphitam--widespread; nidhaya--achieving; aruruhe--was elevated; param padam--to the lotus
feet of the Supreme Lord.
TRANSLATION
King Prthu was greater than the greatest soul and was therefore worshipable by everyone. He performed
many glorious activities in ruling over the surface of the world and was always magnanimous. After
achieving such great success and a reputation which spread throughout the universe, he at last obtained
the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
A responsible king or chief executive has many responsible duties to attend to in ruling over the
citizens. The most important duty of the monarch or the government is to perform various sacrifices as
enjoined in the Vedic literatures. The next duty of the king is to see that every citizen executes the
prescribed duties for his particular community. It is the king's duty to see that everyone perfectly executes
the duties prescribed for the varna and asrama divisions of society. Besides that, as exemplified by King
Prthu, he must develop the earth for the greatest possible production of food grains.
There are different types of great personalities--some are positive great personalities, some comparative
and some superlative--but King Prthu exceeded all of them. He is therefore described here as mahattamah,
greater than the greatest. Maharaja Prthu was a ksatriya, and he discharged his ksatriya duties perfectly.
Similarly, brahmanas, vaisyas and sudras can discharge their respective duties perfectly and thus at the
ultimate end of life be promoted to the transcendental world, which is called param padam. Param padam,
or the Vaikuntha planets, can be achieved only by devotional service. The impersonal Brahman region is
also called param padam, but unless one is attached to the personality of Godhead one must again fall
down to the material world from the impersonal param padam situation. It is said, therefore, aruhya
krcchrena param padam tatah: the impersonalists endeavor very strenuously to achieve the param padam,
or impersonal brahmajyoti, but unfortunately, being bereft of a relationship with the Supreme personality
of Godhead, they come down again to the material world. If one flies in outer space, he can go very high
up, but unless he reaches a planet he must come down again to earth. Similarly, because the
impersonalists who reach the param padam of the impersonal brahmajyoti do not enter into the
Vaikuntha planets, they come down again to this material world and are given shelter in one of the
material planets. Although they may attain Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, all such planets are situated in the
material world.
