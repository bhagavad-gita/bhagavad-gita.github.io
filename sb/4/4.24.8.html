<h2>Text</h2>
sa pancala-patih putran
pitr-vamsa-vivardhanan
daraih samyojayam asa
duhitrh sadrsair varaih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; pancala-patih--the King of Pancala; putran--sons; pitr-vamsa--paternal family; vivardhanan--
increasing; daraih--with wives; samyojayam asa--married; duhitrh--daughters; sadrsaih--qualified; varaih--
with husbands.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After this, King Puranjana, King of the Pancala country, in order to increase the descendants of his
paternal family, married his sons with qualified wives and married his daughters with qualified husbands.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, everyone should marry. One has to accept a wife because a wife will
produce children, and the children in their turn will offer foodstuffs and funeral ceremonies so that the
forefathers, wherever they may live, will be made happy. The offering of oblations in the name of Lord
Visnu is called pindodaka, and it is necessary that the descendants of a family offer pinda to the
forefathers.
Not only was Puranjana, the King of Pancala, satisfied in his own sex life, but he arranged for the sex
life of his 1,100 sons and 110 daughters. In this way one can elevate an aristocratic family to the platform
of a dynasty. It is significant in this verse that Puranjana got both sons and daughters married. It is the
duty of a father and mother to arrange for the marriage of their sons and daughters. That is the obligation
in Vedic society. Sons and daughters should not be allowed freedom to intermingle with the opposite sex
unless they are married. This Vedic social organization is very good in that it stops the promulgation of
illicit sex life, or varna-sankara, which appears under different names in this present day. Unfortunately in
this age although the father and mother are anxious to get their children married, the children refuse to
get married by the arrangement of the parents. Consequently, the number of varna-sankara has increased
throughout the world under different names.
