anyatha karma kurvano
manarudho nibadhyate
guna-pravaha-patito
nasta-prajno vrajaty adhah
SYNONYMS
anyatha--otherwise; karma--fruitive activities; kurvanah--while acting; mana-arudhah--being influenced
by false prestige; nibadhyate--one becomes entangled; guna-pravaha--by the influence of the material
qualities; patitah--fallen; nasta-prajnah--bereft of all intelligence; vrajati--thus he goes; adhah--down.
TRANSLATION
Otherwise, a person who acts whimsically falls down due to false prestige. Thus he becomes involved in
the laws of nature, which are composed of the three qualities [goodness, passion and ignorance]. In this
way a living entity becomes devoid of his real intelligence and becomes perpetually lost in the cycle of
birth and death. Thus he goes up and down from a microbe in stool to a high position in the Brahmaloka
planet.
PURPORT
There are many important words in this verse. The first is anyatha, "otherwise," which indicates one
who does not care for the Vedic rules and regulations. The rules and regulations laid down in the Vedas
are called sastra-vidhi. Bhagavad-gita clearly states that one who does not accept the sastra-vidhi, or rules
and regulations mentioned in the Vedic scriptures, and acts whimsically or puffed up with false pride
never attains perfection in this life, nor does he attain happiness or liberation from the material condition.
yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na sukham na param gatim
"He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection
nor happiness nor the supreme destination." (Bg. 16.23) Thus one who is deliberately transgressing the
rules and regulations of the sastras is simply involving himself more and more in material existence in the
three modes of material nature. Human society should therefore follow the Vedic principles of life, which
are summarized in Bhagavad-gita. Otherwise life in material existence will continue. Foolish persons do
not know that the soul is passing through comes to the human form of life, he is supposed to follow the
rules and regulations laid down in the Vedas. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says that the living entity, since
time immemorial, is suffering the threefold miseries of material nature due to his demoniac attitude,
which is his spirit of revolt against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna also confirms this in
Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah-sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." Every living entity is part and
parcel of God. There is no reason for the living entity's being put into the miserable threefold condition of
material existence but that he voluntarily accepts material existence on the false pretext of becoming an
enjoyer. To save him from this horrible condition, the Lord has given all the Vedic literatures in His
incarnation of Vyasadeva. It is therefore said:
krsna bhuli' sei jiva anadi-bahirmukha
ataeva maya tare deya samsara-duhkha
"By forgetting Krsna, the living entity has become materialistic since time immemorial. Therefore the
illusory energy of Krsna is giving him different types of miseries in material existence." (Cc. Madhya
20.117)
maya-mugdha jivera nahi svatah krsna-jnana
jivere krpaya kaila krsna veda-purana
"When a living entity is enchanted by the external energy, he cannot revive his original Krsna
consciousness independently. Due to such circumstances, Krsna has kindly given him the Vedic
literatures, such as the four Vedas and eighteen Puranas." (Cc. Madhya 20.122) Every human being
should therefore take advantage of the Vedic instructions; otherwise one will be bound by his whimsical
activities and will be without any guide.
The word manarudhah is also very significant in this verse. Under the pretext of becoming great
philosophers and scientists, men throughout the whole world are working on the mental platform. Such
men are generally nondevotees, due to not caring for the instructions given by the Lord to the first living
creature, Lord Brahma. The Bhagavatam (5.18.12) therefore says:
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
mano-rathenasati dhavato bahih
A person who is a nondevotee has no good qualifications because he acts on the mental platform. One
who acts on the mental platform has to change his standard of knowledge periodically. We consequently
see that one philosopher may disagree with another philosopher, and one scientist may put forward a
theory contradicting the theory of another scientist. All of this is due to their working on the mental
platform without a standard of knowledge. In the Vedic instructions, however, the standard of knowledge
is accepted, even though it may sometimes appear that the statements are contradictory. Because the
Vedas are the standard of knowledge, even though they may appear contradictory, they should be
accepted. If one does not accept them, he will be bound by the material conditions.
The material conditions are described in this verse as guna-pravaha, the flowing of the three modes of
material nature. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura therefore says in a song, miche mayara vase, yaccha bhese',
khaccha habudubu, bhai: "Why are you suffering? Why are you sometimes being drowned in the waves of
material nature and sometimes coming to the surface?" Jiva krsna-dasa, ei visvasa, karle ta' ara duhkha
nai: "Please therefore accept yourself as the servant of Krsna. Then you will be freed from all miseries." As
soon as one surrenders to Krsna and accepts the perfect standard of knowledge, which is Bhagavad-gita as
it is, he then comes out of the material modes of nature and does not fall down and lose his knowledge.
Nasta-prajnah. The word prajna means "perfect knowledge," and nasta-prajna means "one who has no
perfect knowledge." One who does not have perfect knowledge has only mental speculation. By such
mental speculation one falls down and down into a hellish condition of life. By transgressing the laws laid
down in the sastras, one cannot become pure in heart. When one's heart is not purified, one acts
according to the three material modes of nature. These activities are very nicely explained in verses 1
through 6 of the Seventeenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita. Bhagavad-gita (2.45) further explains:
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the Self." The entire world and all material knowledge is within the three
modes of material nature. One has to transcend these modes, and to attain that platform of transcendence
one must follow the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become perfect in life.
Otherwise one will be knocked down by the waves of the material nature's three modes. This is further
explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.30) in the words of Prahlada Maharaja:
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho 'bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
Materialistic persons, who are too much engaged in material enjoyment and who do not know anything
beyond their material experiences, are carried by the whims of material nature. They live a life
characterized by chewing the chewed, and they are controlled by their uncontrolled senses. Thus they go
down to the darkest regions of hellish life.
