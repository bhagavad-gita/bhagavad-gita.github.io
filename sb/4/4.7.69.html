<h2>Purport</h2>
Here in this verse Narada Muni has described Dhruva Maharaja as prabhu. This word is applicable to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes the spiritual master is addressed as Prabhupada. Prabhu
means "the Supreme Personality of Godhead," and pada means "post." According to Vaisnava philosophy,
the spiritual master occupies the post of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or in other words he is the
bona fide representative of the Supreme Lord. Dhruva Maharaja is also described here as prabhu because
he is an acarya of the Vaisnava school. Another meaning of prabhu is "master of the senses," just like the
word svami. Another significant word is suduskaram, "very difficult to perform." What was the task that
Dhruva Maharaja undertook? The most difficult task in life is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and Dhruva Maharaja would be able to do that. We must remember that Dhruva Maharaja was
not fickle; he was determined to execute his service and then come back. Every devotee, therefore, should
be determined that in this life he will be able to satisfy the Supreme personality of Godhead and by that
process go back home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of the highest mission of life.
