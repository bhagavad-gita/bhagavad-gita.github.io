<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes we suddenly experience something that was never experienced in the present body by sight
or hearing. Sometimes we see such things suddenly in dreams.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In dreams we sometimes see things that we have never experienced in the present body. Sometimes in
dreams we think that we are flying in the sky, although we have no experience of flying. This means that
once in a previous life, either as a demigod or astronaut, we flew in the sky. The impression is there in the
stockpile of the mind, and it suddenly expresses itself. It is like fermentation taking place in the depths of
water, which sometimes manifests itself in bubbles on the water's surface. Sometimes we dream of coming
to a place we have never known or experienced in this lifetime, but this is proof that in a past life we
experienced this. The impression is kept within the mind and sometimes becomes manifest either in
dream or in thought. The conclusion is that the mind is the storehouse of various thoughts and
experiences undergone during our past lives. Thus there is a chain of continuation from one life to
another, from previous lives to this life, and from this life to future lives. This is also sometimes proved by
saying that a man is a born poet, a born scientist or a born devotee. If, like Maharaja Ambarisa, we think
of Krsna constantly in this life (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh), we will certainly be transferred to
the kingdom of God at the time of death. Even if our attempt to be Krsna conscious is not complete, our
Krsna consciousness will continue in the next life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (6.41):
prapya punya-krtam lokan
usitva sasvatih samah
sucinam srimatam gehe
yoga-bhrasto 'bhijayate
"The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities,
is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy."
If we rigidly follow the principles of meditation on Krsna, there is no doubt that in our next life we will
be transferred to Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana.
