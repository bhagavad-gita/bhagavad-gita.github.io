evam sa manaso hamso
hamsena pratibodhitah
sva-sthas tad-vyabhicarena
nastam apa punah smrtim
SYNONYMS
evam--thus; sah--he (the individual soul); manasah--living together within the heart; hamsah--like the
swan; hamsena--by the other swan; pratibodhitah--being instructed; sva-sthah--situated in self-realization;
tat-vyabhicarena--by being separated from the Supersoul; nastam--which was lost; apa--gained; punah--
again; smrtim--real memory.
TRANSLATION
In this way both swans live together in the heart. When the one swan is instructed by the other, he is
situated in his constitutional position. This means he regains his original Krsna consciousness, which was
lost because of his material attraction.
PURPORT
Here it is clearly stated: hamso hamsena pratibodhitah. The individual soul and the Supersoul are both
compared to swans (hamsa) because they are white, or uncontaminated. One swan, however, is superior
and is the instructor of the other. When the inferior swan is separated from the other swan, he is attracted
to material enjoyment. This is the cause of his falldown. When he hears the instructions of the other
swan, he understands his real position and is again revived to his original consciousness. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, comes down (avatara) to deliver His devotees and kill the demons. He also
gives His sublime instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita. The individual soul has to understand his
position by the grace of the Lord and the spiritual master because the text of Bhagavad-gita cannot be
understood simply by academic qualifications. One has to learn Bhagavad-gita from a realized soul.
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
(Bg. 4.34)
Thus one has to select a bona fide spiritual master and become enlightened to his original
consciousness. In this way the individual soul can understand that he is always subordinate to the
Supersoul. As soon as he declines to remain subordinate and tries to become an enjoyer, he begins his
material conditioning. When he abandons this spirit of being an individual owner or enjoyer, he becomes
situated in his liberated state. The word sva-sthah, meaning "situated in one's original position," is very
significant in this verse. When one gives up his unwanted attitude of superiority, he becomes situated in
his original position. The word tad-vyabhicarena is also significant, for it indicates that when one is
separated from God due to disobedience, his real sense is lost. Again, by the grace of Krsna and guru, he
can be properly situated in his liberated position. These verses are spoken by Srila Narada Muni, and his
purpose in speaking them is to revive our consciousness. Although the living entity and the Supersoul are
one in quality, the individual soul has to pursue the instruction of the Supersoul. That is the state of
liberation.
