<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
antardhano nabhasvatyam
havirdhanam avindata
ya indram asva-hartaram
vidvan api na jaghnivan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
antardhanah--the king of the name Antardhana; nabhasvatyam--unto his wife Nabhasvati;
havirdhanam--of the name Havirdhana; avindata--obtained; yah--who; indram--King Indra; asvahartaram--
who was stealing the horse of his father; vidvan api--although he knew it; na jaghnivan--did not
kill.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Antardhana had another wife, named Nabhasvati, and by her he was happy to beget another
son, named Havirdhana. Since Maharaja Antardhana was very liberal, he did not kill Indra while the
demigod was stealing his father's horse at the sacrifice.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood from various scriptures and puranas that the King of heaven, Indra, was very expert in
stealing and kidnapping. He could steal anything without being visible to the proprietor, and he could
kidnap anyone's wife without being detected. Once he raped the wife of Gautama Muni by using his
disappearing art, and similarly by becoming invisible he stole the horse of Maharaja Prthu. Although in
human society such activities are considered abominable, the demigod Indra was not considered to be
degraded by them. Although Antardhana could understand that King Indra was stealing the horse from
his father, he did not kill Indra, for he knew that if one who is very powerful sometimes commits an
abominable act, it should be disregarded. In Bhagavad-gita (9.30) it is clearly stated:
api cet su-duracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah
Thus the Lord says that even if a devotee commits an abominable act, he should be considered a sadhu,
or a pious man, because of his unflinching devotion to the Lord. The devotees of the Lord never willingly
commit any sinful act, but sometimes they commit something abominable due to their previous habits.
Such acts should not be taken very seriously, however, because the devotees of the Lord are very
powerful, whether they are on the heavenly planets or on this planet. If by chance they commit something
abominable, it should not be taken into account, but should be overlooked.
