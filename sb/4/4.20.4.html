<h2>Text</h2>
prajas tam dipa-balibhih
sambhrtasesa-mangalaih
abhiyur mrsta-kanyas ca
mrsta-kundala-manditah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prajah--citizens; tam--to him; dipa-balibhih--with lamps; sambhrta--equipped with; asesa--unlimited;
mangalaih--auspicious articles; abhiyuh--came forward to welcome; mrsta--with beautiful bodily luster;
kanyah ca--and unmarried girls; mrsta--colliding with; kundala--earrings; manditah--being bedecked with.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As the King entered the gate of the city, all the citizens received him with many auspicious articles like
lamps, flowers and yogurt. The King was also received by many beautiful unmarried girls whose bodies
were bedecked with various ornaments, especially with earrings which collided with one another.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Offerings of natural products such as betel nuts, bananas, newly grown wheat, paddy, yogurt and
vermillion, carried by the citizens and scattered throughout the city, are all auspicious paraphernalia,
according to Vedic civilization, for receiving a prominent guest like a bridegroom, king or spiritual
master. Similarly, a welcome offered by unmarried girls who are internally and externally clean and are
dressed in nice garments and ornaments is also auspicious. Kumari, or unmarried girls untouched by the
hand of any member of the opposite sex, are auspicious members of society. Even today in Hindu society
the most conservative families do not allow unmarried girls to go out freely or mix with boys. They are
very carefully protected by their parents while unmarried, after marriage they are protected by their young
husbands, and when elderly they are protected by their children. When thus protected, women as a class
remain an always auspicious source of energy to man.
