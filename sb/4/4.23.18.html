<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Narada continued: My dear King Pracinabarhi, as soon as King Puranjana saw his Queen
lying on the ground, appearing like a mendicant, he immediately became bewildered.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word avadhutam is especially significant, for it refers to a mendicant who does not take
care of his body. Since the Queen was lying on the ground without bedding and proper dress, King
Puranjana became very much aggrieved. In other words, he repented that he had neglected his
intelligence and had engaged himself in the forest in killing animals. In other words, when one's good
intelligence is separated or neglected, he fully engages in sinful activities. Due to neglecting one's good
intelligence, or Krsna consciousness, one becomes bewildered and engages in sinful activities. Upon
realizing this, a man becomes repentant. Such repentance is described by Narottama dasa Thakura:
hari hari viphale janama gonainu
manusya-janama paiya, radha-krsna na bhajiya,
janiya suniya visa khainu
Narottama dasa Thakura herein says that he repents for having spoiled his human life and knowingly
drunk poison. By not being Krsna conscious, one willingly drinks the poison of material life. The purport
is that one certainly becomes addicted to sinful activities when he becomes devoid of his good chaste wife,
or when he has lost his good sense and does not take to Krsna consciousness.
