<h2>Text</h2>
brahmana uvaca
ka tvam kasyasi ko vayam
sayano yasya socasi
janasi kim sakhayam mam
yenagre vicacartha ha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahmanah uvaca--the learned brahmana said; ka--who; tvam--you; kasya--whose; asi--are you; kah--
who; va--or; ayam--this man; sayanah--lying down; yasya--for whom; socasi--you are lamenting; janasi
kim--do you know; sakhayam--friend; mam--Me; yena--with whom; agre--formerly; vicacartha--you
consulted; ha--certainly.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The brahmana inquired as follows: Who are you? Whose wife or daughter are you? Who is the man
lying here? It appears you are lamenting for this dead body. Don't you recognize Me? I am your eternal
friend. You may remember that many times in the past you have consulted Me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a person's relative dies, renunciation is automatically visible. Consultation with the Supersoul
seated within everyone's heart is possible only when one is completely free from the contamination of
material attachment. One who is sincere and pure gets an opportunity to consult with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature sitting within everyone's heart. The Paramatma is
always the caitya-guru, the spiritual master within, and He comes before one externally as the instructor
and initiator spiritual master. The Lord can reside within the heart, and He can also come out before a
person and give him instructions. Thus the spiritual master is not different from the Supersoul sitting
within the heart. An uncontaminated soul or living entity can get a chance to meet the Paramatma face to
face. Just as one gets a chance to consult with the Paramatma within his heart, one also gets a chance to
see Him actually situated before him. Then one can take instructions from the Supersoul directly. This is
the duty of the pure devotee: to see the bona fide spiritual master and consult with the Supersoul within
the heart.
When the brahmana asked the woman who the man lying on the floor was, she answered that he was
her spiritual master and that she was perplexed about what to do in his absence. At such a time the
Supersoul immediately appears, provided the devotee is purified in heart by following the directions of
the spiritual master. A sincere devotee who follows the instructions of the spiritual master certainly gets
direct instructions from his heart from the Supersoul. Thus a sincere devotee is always helped directly or
indirectly by the spiritual master and the Supersoul. This is confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta: guru-krsnaprasade
paya bhakti-lata-bija. If the devotee serves his spiritual master sincerely, Krsna automatically
becomes pleased. Yasya prasadad bhagavad-prasadah. By satisfying the spiritual master, one automatically
satisfies Krsna. Thus the devotee becomes enriched by both the spiritual master and Krsna. The Supersoul
is eternally the friend of the living entity and always remains with him. The Supersoul has always been
ready to help the living entity, even before the creation of this material world. It is therefore stated here:
yenagre vicacartha. The word agre means "before the creation." Thus the Supersoul has been
accompanying the living entity since before the creation.
