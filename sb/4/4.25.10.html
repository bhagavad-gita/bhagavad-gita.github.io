<h2>Text</h2>
asit puranjano nama
raja rajan brhac-chravah
tasyavijnata-namasit
sakhavijnata-cestitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asit--there was; puranjanah--Puranjana; nama--named; raja--king; rajan--O King; brhat-sravah--whose
activities were great; tasya--his; avijnata--the unknown one; nama--of the name; asit--there was; sakha--
friend; avijnata--unknown; cestitah--whose activities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, once in the past lived a king named Puranjana, who was celebrated for his great activities.
He had a friend named Avijnata ["the unknown one"]. No one could understand the activities of Avijnata.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living entity is puranjana. The word puram means "within this body, within this form," and jana
means "living entity." Thus everyone is puranjana. Every living entity is supposed to be the king of his
body because the living entity is given full freedom to use his body as he likes. He usually engages his
body for sense gratification, because one who is in the bodily conception of life feels that the ultimate goal
of life is to serve the senses. This is the process of karma-kanda. One who has no inner knowledge, who
does not know that he is actually the spirit soul living within the body, who is simply enamored by the
dictation of the senses, is called a materialist. A materialistic person interested in sense gratification can be
called a puranjana. Because such a materialistic person utilizes his senses according to his whims, he may
also be called a king. An irresponsible king takes the royal position to be his personal property and
misuses his treasury for sense gratification.
The word brhac-chravah is also significant. The word sravah means "fame." The living entity is famous
from ancient times, for as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.20), na jayate mriyate va: "The living entity is never
born and never dies." Because he is eternal, his activities are eternal, although they are performed in
different types of bodies. Na hanyate hanyamane sarire: "He does not die, even after the annihilation of
the body." Thus the living entity transmigrates from one body to another and performs various activities.
In each body the living entity performs so many acts. Sometimes he becomes a great hero--just like
Hiranyakasipu and Kamsa or, in the modern age, Napoleon or Hitler. The activities of such men are
certainly very great, but as soon as their bodies are finished, everything else is finished. Then they remain
in name only. Therefore a living entity may be called brhac-chravah; he may have a great reputation for
various types of activities. Nonetheless, he has a friend whom he does not know. Materialistic persons do
not understand that God is present as the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart of every living
entity. Although the Paramatma sits beside the jivatma as a friend, the jivatma, or living entity, does not
know it. Consequently he is described as avijnata-sakha, meaning "one who has an unknown friend." The
word avijnata-cestitah is also significant because a living entity works hard under the direction of the
Paramatma and is carried away by the laws of nature. Nonetheless, he thinks himself independent of God
and independent of the stringent laws of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.24):
acchedyo 'yam adahyo 'yam
akledyo 'sosya eva ca
nityah sarva-gatah sthanur
acalo 'yam sanatanah
"This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble and can be neither burned nor dried. He is
everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same."
The living entity is sanatana, eternal. Because he cannot be killed by any weapon, burnt into ashes by
fire, soaked or moistened by water, nor dried up by air, he is considered to be immune to material
reactions. Although he is changing bodies, he is not affected by the material conditions. He is placed
under the material conditions, and he acts according to the directions of his friend, the Supersoul. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Thus
the Lord as Paramatma is situated in everyone's heart, and He gives directions to the living entity to act in
whatever way the living entity desires. In this life and in his previous lives the living entity does not know
that the Lord is giving him a chance to fulfill all kinds of desires. No one can fulfill any desire without the
sanction of the Lord. All the facilities given by the Lord are unknown to the conditioned soul.
