<h2>Translation</h2>
But since his heart was already attracted by the deities, somehow or other he gathered his senses, and
with folded hands and sweet words he began to offer prayers to the predominating deities of the universe.
The great sage Atri said: O Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu and Lord Siva, you have divided yourself into three
bodies by accepting the three modes of material nature, as you do in every millennium for the creation,
maintenance and dissolution of the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all of you
and beg to inquire whom of you three I have called by my prayer.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Atri Rsi called for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, jagad-isvara, the Lord of the universe. The Lord
must exist before the creation, otherwise how could He be its Lord? If someone constructs a big building,
this indicates that he must have existed before the building was constructed. Therefore the Supreme Lord,
the creator of the universe, must be transcendental to the material modes of nature. But it is known that
Visnu takes charge of the mode of goodness, Brahma takes charge of the mode of passion, and Lord Siva
takes charge of the mode of ignorance. Therefore Atri Muni said, "That jagad-isvara, the Lord of the
universe, must be one of you, but since three of you have appeared, I cannot recognize whom I have
called. You are all so kind. Please let me know who is actually jagad-isvara, the Lord of the universe." In
fact, Atri Rsi was doubtful about the constitutional position of the Supreme Lord, Visnu, but he was quite
certain that the Lord of the universe cannot be one of the creatures created by maya. His very inquiry
about whom he had called indicates that he was in doubt about the constitutional position of the Lord.
Therefore he prayed to all three, "Kindly let me know who is the transcendental Lord of the universe." He
was certain, of course, that not all of them could he the Lord, but the Lord of the universe was one of the
three.
