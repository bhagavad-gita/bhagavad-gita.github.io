<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are the viewer of the results of pious activities. You are inclination, disinclination
and their resultant activities. You are the cause of the miserable conditions of life caused by irreligion, and
therefore You are death. I offer You my respectful obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart, and from Him issue a living entity's
inclinations and disinclinations. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
"I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness."
The Supreme Personality of Godhead causes the asuras to forget Him and the devotees to remember
Him. One's disinclinations are due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Bhagavad-gita
(16.7), pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidur asurah: the asuras do not know which way one should be
inclined to act and which way one should not be inclined to act. Although the asuras oppose devotional
service, it is to be understood that they are inclined that way due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Because the asuras do not like to engage in the Lord's devotional service, the Lord within gives them the
intelligence to forget. Ordinary karmis desire promotion to Pitrloka, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.25).
Yanti deva-vrata devan pitrn yanti pitr-vratah: "Those who worship the demigods will take birth among
the demigods, and those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors."
In this verse the word duhkha-daya is also very significant, for those who are nondevotees are
perpetually put into the cycle of birth and death. This is a very miserable condition. Because one's
position in life is attained according to one's activities, the asuras, or nondevotees, are put into such
miserable conditions.
