<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
prajapatih sa bhagavan
rucis tasyam ajijanat
mithunam brahma-varcasvi
paramena samadhina
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prajapatih--one who is entrusted with begetting children; sah--he; bhagavan--the most opulent; rucih--
the great sage Ruci; tasyam--in her; ajijanat--gave birth; mithunam--couple; brahma-varcasvi--spiritually
very much powerful; paramena--with great strength; samadhina--in trance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Ruci, who was very powerful in his brahminical qualifications and was appointed one of the progenitors
of the living entities, begot one son and one daughter by his wife, Akuti.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word brahma-varcasvi is very significant. Ruci was a brahmana, and he executed the brahminical
duties very rigidly. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the brahminical qualifications are control of the senses,
control of the mind, cleanliness within and without, development of spiritual and material knowledge,
simplicity, truthfulness, faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, etc. There are many qualities which
indicate a brahminical personality, and it is understood that Ruci followed all the brahminical principles
rigidly. Therefore he is specifically mentioned as brahma-varcasvi. One who is born of a brahmana father
but does not act as a brahmana is called, in Vedic language, a brahma-bandhu, and is calculated to be on
the level of sudras and women. Thus in the Bhagavatam we find that Mahabharata was specifically
compiled by Vyasadeva for stri-sudra-brahma-bandhu. Stri means women, sudra means the lower class of
civilized human society, and brahma-bandhu means persons who are born in the families of brahmanas
but do not follow the rules and regulations carefully. All of these three classes are called less intelligent;
they have no access to the study of the Vedas, which are specifically meant for persons who have acquired
the brahminical qualifications. This restriction is based not upon any sectarian distinction but upon
qualification. The Vedic literatures cannot be understood unless one has developed the brahminical
qualifications. It is regrettable, therefore, that persons who have no brahminical qualifications and have
never been trained under a bona fide spiritual master nevertheless comment on Vedic literatures like the
Srimad-Bhagavatam and other puranas, for such persons cannot deliver their real message. Ruci was
considered a first-class brahmana; therefore he is mentioned here as brahma-varcasvi, one who had full
prowess in brahminical strength.
