<h2>Text</h2>
aspasta-kirtih suyasa
murkho bhavati panditah
idam svasty-ayanam pumsam
amangalya-nivaranam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aspasta-kirtih--unmanifested reputation; su-yasah--very famous; murkhah--illiterate; bhavati--becomes;
panditah--learned; idam--this; svasti-ayanam--auspiciousness; pumsam--of the men; amangalya--
inauspiciousness; nivaranam--prohibiting.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Also, one who hears this narration three times will become very reputable if he is not recognized in
society, and he will become a great scholar if he is illiterate. In other words, hearing of the narrations of
Prthu Maharaja is so auspicious that it drives away all bad luck.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world, everyone wants some profit, some adoration and some reputation. By associating
in different ways with the Supreme Personality of godhead or His devotee, one can very easily become
opulent in every respect. Even if one is not known or recognized by society, he becomes very famous and
important if he takes to devotional service and preaching. As far as education is concerned, one can
become recognized in society as a great learned scholar simply by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam and
Bhagavad-gita, wherein the pastimes of the Lord and His devotees are described. This material world is
full of dangers at every step, but a devotee has no fear because devotional service is so auspicious that it
automatically counteracts all kinds of bad luck. Since hearing about Prthu Maharaja is one of the items of
devotional service (sravanam), naturally hearing about him brings all good fortune.
