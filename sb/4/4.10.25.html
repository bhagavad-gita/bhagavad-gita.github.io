<h2>Text</h2>
sa eva visvam srjati
sa evavati hanti ca
athapi hy anahankaran
najyate guna-karmabhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He; eva--certainly; visvam--the universe; srjati--creates; sah--He; eva--certainly; avati--maintains;
hanti--annihilates; ca--also; atha api--moreover; hi--certainly; anahankarat--from being without ego; na--
not; ajyate--becomes entangled; guna--by the modes of material nature; karmabhih--by activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world, maintains it, and annihilates it in due
course of time, but because He is transcendental to such activities, He is never affected by ego in such
action or by the modes of material nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word anahankara means "without ego." The conditioned soul has a false ego, and as a
result of his karma he gets different types of bodies in this material world. Sometimes he gets the body of
a demigod, and he thinks that body to be his identity. Similarly, when he gets the body of a dog he
identifies his self with that body. But for the Supreme Personality of Godhead there is no such distinction
between the body and the soul. Bhagavad-gita, therefore, certifies that anyone who thinks of Krsna as an
ordinary human being is without knowledge of His transcendental nature and is a great fool. The Lord
says, na mam karmani limpanti: He is not affected by anything He does, because He is never contaminated
by the material modes of nature. That we have a material body proves that we are infected by the three
material modes of nature. The Lord says to Arjuna, "You and I had many, many births previously, but I
remember everything, whereas you do not." That is the difference between the living entity, or
conditioned soul, and the Supreme Soul. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no
material body, and because He has no material body, He is not affected by any work He executes. There
are many Mayavadi philosophers who consider that Krsna's body is the effect of a concentration of the
material mode of goodness, and they distinguish Krsna's soul from Krsna's body. The real situation,
however, is that the body of the conditioned soul, even if he has a large accumulation of material
goodness, is material, whereas Krsna's body is never material; it is transcendental. Krsna has no false ego,
for He does not identify Himself with the false and temporary body. His body is always eternal; He
descends to this world in His own original, spiritual body. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita as param
bhavam. The words param bhavam and divyam are especially significant in understanding Krsna's
personality.
