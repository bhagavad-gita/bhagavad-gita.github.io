<h2>Text</h2>
bhutaih pancabhir arabdhair
yosit purusa eva hi
tayor vyavayat sambhutir
yosit-purusayor iha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhutaih--by the material elements; pancabhih--five; arabdhaih--developed; yosit--woman; purusah--
man; eva--just so; hi--certainly; tayoh--of them; vyavayat--by sexual life; sambhutih--the further creation;
yosit--of women; purusayoh--and of men; iha--in this material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The creation of the material world begins with the five elements, and thus everything, including the
body of a man or a woman, is created of these elements. By the sexual life of man and woman, the number
of men and women in this material world is further increased.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Svayambhuva Manu saw that Dhruva Maharaja understood the philosophy of Vaisnavism and yet
was still dissatisfied because of his brother's death, he gave him an explanation of how this material body
is created by the five elements of material nature. In the Bhagavad-gita it is also confirmed, prakrteh
kriyamanani: everything is created, maintained and annihilated by the material modes of nature. In the
background, of course, there is the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena). In the Ninth Chapter, Krsna says, "Under My
superintendence material nature is acting." Svayambhuva Manu wanted to impress on Dhruva Maharaja
that the death of the material body of his brother was not actually the Yaksas' fault; it was an act of the
material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has immense varieties of potencies, and they act in
different gross and subtle ways.
It is by such powerful potencies that the universe is created, although grossly it appears to be no more
than the five elements--earth, water, fire, air and ether. Similarly, the bodies of all species of living
entities, whether human beings or demigods, animals or birds, are also created by the same five elements,
and by sexual union they expand into more and more living entities. That is the way of creation,
maintenance and annihilation. One should not be disturbed by the waves of material nature in this
process. Dhruva Maharaja was indirectly advised not to be afflicted by the death of his brother because
our relationship with the body is completely material. The real self, spirit soul, is never annihilated or
killed by anyone.
