<h2>Text</h2>
balo 'si bata natmanam
anya-stri-garbha-sambhrtam
nunam veda bhavan yasya
durlabhe 'rthe manorathah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
balah--child; asi--you are; bata--however; na--not; atmanam--my own; anya--other; stri--woman;
garbha--womb; sambhrtam--born by; nunam--however; veda--just try to know; bhavan--yourself; yasya--
of which; durlabhe--unapproachable; arthe--matter; manah-rathah--desirous.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear child, you are unaware that you were born not of my womb but of another woman. Therefore
you should know that your attempt is doomed to failure. You are trying to fulfill a desire which is
impossible to fulfill.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The small child, Dhruva Maharaja, was naturally affectionate toward his father, and he did not know
that there was a distinction between his two mothers. This distinction was pointed out by Queen Suruci,
who informed him that since he was a child he did not understand the distinction between the two
queens. This is another statement of Queen Suruci's pride.
