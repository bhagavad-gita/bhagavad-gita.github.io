<h2>Text</h2>
andhav amisam pauranam
nirvak-pesaskrtav ubhau
aksanvatam adhipatis
tabhyam yati karoti ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
andhau--blind; amisam--among those; pauranam--of the inhabitants; nirvak--of the name Nirvak;
pesaskrtau--of the name Pesaskrt; ubhau--both of them; aksan-vatam--of the people who possessed eyes;
adhipatih--ruler; tabhyam--with both of them; yati--used to go; karoti--used to act; ca--and.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Of the many inhabitants of this city, there are two persons named Nirvak and Pesaskrt. Although King
Puranjana was the ruler of citizens who possessed eyes, he unfortunately used to associate with these
blind men. Accompanied by them, he used to go here and there and perform various activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is a reference to the arms and legs of the living entity. The two legs do not speak, and they are
blind. If a person simply trusts his legs to take him walking, he is likely to fall into a hole or bump into
something. Thus led by the blind legs, one's life may be placed in jeopardy.
Of the senses that are working, the hands and legs are very important, but they have no eyes to see. This
means that in the hands and legs there are no holes. In the head there are many holes--two eyes, two
nostrils, two ears and one mouth--but lower down, in the arms and legs, there are no holes.
Consequently, the arms and legs have been described as andha, blind. Although the living entity has many
holes in his body, he nonetheless has to work with his hands and arms. Although the living entity is the
master of many other senses, when he has to go somewhere, do something or touch something, he has to
use his blind legs and hands.
