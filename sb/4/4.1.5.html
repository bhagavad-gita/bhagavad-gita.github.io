<h2>Text</h2>
aninye sva-grham putryah
putram vitata-rocisam
svayambhuvo muda yukto
rucir jagraha daksinam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aninye--brought to; sva-grham--home; putryah--born of the daughter; putram--the son; vitata-rocisam--
very powerful; svayambhuvah--the Manu named Svayambhuva; muda--being very pleased; yuktah--with;
rucih--the great sage Ruci; jagraha--kept; daksinam--the daughter named Daksina.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Svayambhuva Manu very gladly brought home the beautiful boy named Yajna, and Ruci, his son-in-law,
kept with him the daughter, Daksina.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Svayambhuva Manu was very glad to see that his daughter Akuti had given birth to both a boy and girl.
He was afraid that he would take one son and that because of this his son-in-law Ruci might be sorry.
Thus when he heard that a daughter was born along with the boy, he was very glad. Ruci, according to his
promise, returned his male child to Svayambhuva Manu and decided to keep the daughter, whose name
was Daksina. One of Lord Visnu's names is Yajna because He is the master of the Vedas. The name Yajna
comes from yajusam patih, which means "Lord of all sacrifices." In the Yajur Veda there are different
ritualistic prescriptions for performing yajnas, and the beneficiary of all such yajnas is the Supreme Lord,
Visnu. Therefore it is stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmanah: one should act, but one should
perform one's prescribed duties only for the sake of Yajna, or Visnu. lf one does not act for the satisfaction
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if one does not perform devotional service, then there will be
reactions to all one's activities. It does not matter if the reaction is good or bad; if our activities are not
dovetailed with the desire of the Supreme Lord, or if we do not act in Krsna consciousness, then we shall
be responsible for the results of all our activities. There is always a reaction to every kind of action, but if
actions are performed for Yajna, there is no reaction. Thus if one acts for Yajna, or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one is not entangled in the material condition, for it is mentioned in the Vedas
and also in Bhagavad-gita that the Vedas and the Vedic rituals are all meant for understanding the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. From the very beginning one should try to act in Krsna
consciousness; that will free one from the reactions of material activities.
