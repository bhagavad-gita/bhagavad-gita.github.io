<h2>Text</h2>
iti cadhoksajesasya
prthos tu paramodayam
asuyan bhagavan indrah
pratighatam acikarat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; ca--also; adhoksaja-isasya--who accepted Adhoksaja as his worshipable Lord; prthoh--of King
Prthu; tu--then; parama--the topmost; udayam--opulence; asuyan--being envious of; bhagavan--the most
powerful; indrah--the King of heaven; pratighatam--impediments; acikarat--made.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Prthu was dependent on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Adhoksaja.
Because King Prthu Performed so many sacrifices, he was superhumanly enhanced by the mercy of the
Supreme Lord. King Prthu's opulence, however, could not be tolerated by the King of heaven, Indra, who
tried to impede the progress of his opulence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse there are three significant purposes expressed in the words adhoksaja, bhagavan indrah and
prthoh. Maharaja Prthu is an incarnation of Visnu, yet he is a great devotee of Lord Visnu. Although an
empowered incarnation of Lord Visnu, he is nonetheless a living entity. As such, he must be a devotee of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although one is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and is an incarnation, he should not forget his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In Kali-yuga there are many self-made incarnations, rascals, who declare themselves to be the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The words bhagavan indrah indicate that a living entity can even be as
exalted and powerful as King Indra, for even King Indra is an ordinary living entity in the material world
and possesses the four defects of the conditioned soul. King Indra is described herein as bhagavan, which
is generally used in reference to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this case, however, King Indra is
addressed as bhagavan because he has so much power in his hands. Despite his becoming bhagavan, he is
envious of the incarnation of God, Prthu Maharaja. The defects of material life are so strong that due to
contamination King Indra becomes envious of an incarnation of God.
We should try to understand, therefore, how a conditioned soul becomes fallen. The opulence of King
Prthu was not dependent on material conditions. As described in this verse, he was a great devotee of
Adhoksaja. The word adhoksaja indicates the Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the expression of
mind and words. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears before the devotee in His
original form of eternal bliss and knowledge. The devotee is allowed to see the Supreme Lord face to face,
although the Lord is beyond the expression of our senses and beyond our direct perception.
