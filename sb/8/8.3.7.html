<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse describes the qualifications for devotees or persons highly elevated in spiritual consciousness.
Devotees are always equal to everyone, seeing no distinction between lower and higher classes. panditah
sama-darsinah. They look upon everyone as a spirit soul who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.
Thus they are competent to search for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Understanding that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is the friend of everyone (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam), they act as friends
of everyone on behalf of the Supreme Lord. Making no distinction between one nation and another or one
community and another, they preach Krsna consciousness, the teachings of Bhagavad-gita, everywhere.
Thus they are competent to see the lotus feet of the Lord. Such preachers in Krsna consciousness are
called paramahamsas. As indicated by the word vimukta-sanga, they have nothing to do with material
conditions. One must take shelter of such a devotee in order to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
