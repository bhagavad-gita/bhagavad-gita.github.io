<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, seeing Gajendra in such an aggrieved position, the unborn Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Hari, immediately got down from the back of Garuda by His causeless mercy and pulled the King of the
elephants, along with the crocodile, out of the water. Then, in the presence of all the demigods, who were
looking on, the Lord severed the crocodile's mouth from its body with His disc. In this way He saved
Gajendra, the King of the elephants.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Gajendra's Prayers of Surrender."
Chapter Four
Gajendra Returns to the Spiritual World
This Fourth Chapter describes the previous birth of Gajendra and the crocodile. It tells how the
crocodile became a Gandharva and how Gajendra became an associate of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
There was a king on the Gandharva planet whose name was Huhu. Once this King Huhu was enjoying
with women in the water, and while enjoying he pulled the leg of Devala Rsi, who was also taking a bath
in the water. Upon this, the sage became very angry and immediately cursed him to become a crocodile.
King Huhu was very sorry when cursed in that way, and he begged pardon from the sage, who in
compassion gave him the benediction that he would be freed when Gajendra was delivered by the
Personality of Godhead. Thus the crocodile was delivered when killed by Narayana.
When Gajendra, by the mercy of the Lord, became one of the Lord's associates in Vaikuntha, he got four
hands. This achievement is called sarupya-mukti, or the liberation of receiving a spiritual body exactly
like that of Narayana. Gajendra, in his previous birth, had been a great devotee of Lord Visnu. His name
was Indradyumna, and he was the King of the Tamila country. Following the Vedic principles, this King
retired from family life and constructed a small cottage in the Malayacala Hills, where he always
worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead in silence. Agastya Rsi, along with many disciples, once
approached King Indradyumna's asrama, but because the King was meditating on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, he could not receive Agastya Rsi properly. Thus the rsi became very angry and cursed the
King to become a dull elephant. In accordance with this curse, the King was born as an elephant, and he
forgot all about his previous activities in devotional service. Nonetheless, in his birth as an elephant, when
he was dangerously attacked by the crocodile, he remembered his past life in devotional service and
remembered a prayer he had learned in that life. Because of this prayer, he again received the mercy of the
Lord. Thus he was immediately delivered, and he became one of the Lord's four-handed associates.
Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing the good fortune of the elephant. Sukadeva Gosvami
says that by hearing the narration of Gajendra's deliverance, one can also get the opportunity to be
delivered. Sukadeva Gosvami vividly describes this, and thus the chapter ends.
