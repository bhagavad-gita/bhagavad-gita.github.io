<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are the original generator of all living entities, stationary or moving, and You are also the
generator of the Prajapatis. O my Lord, as a boat is the only hope for a person drowning in the water, You
are the only shelter for the demigods, who are now bereft of their heavenly position.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Supreme Lord Agrees to Become Aditi's Son."
Chapter Eighteen
Lord Vamanadeva, the Dwarf Incarnation
This chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of
Maharaja Bali, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.
Lord Vamanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell,
disc, club and lotus. His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments. Lord Visnu
appeared at an auspicious moment on Sravana-dvadasi when the Abhijit star had arisen. At that time, in
all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods,
the cows, the brahmanas and even the seasons were happy because of God's appearance. Therefore this
auspicious day is called Vijaya. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a sac-cid-ananda
body, appeared as the son of Kasyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished. After His
appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vamana). All the great sages expressed their
jubilation, and with Kasyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vamana.
At the time of Lord Vamanadeva's sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Brhaspati, the
goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahma,
Kuvera, the seven rsis and others. Lord Vamanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side
of the Narmada River, at the field known as Bhrgukaccha, where brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty were
performing yajnas. Wearing a belt made of munja straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread
and carrying in His hands a danda, an umbrella and a waterpot (kamandalu), Lord Vamanadeva appeared
in the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali. Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests
were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord
Vamanadeva. Even Lord Siva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord
Vamanadeva. Therefore, after washing the Lord's feet, Bali Maharaja immediately accepted the water from
the Lord's feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified. Then Bali
Maharaja inquired of Lord Vamanadeva's welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or
anything He might desire.
