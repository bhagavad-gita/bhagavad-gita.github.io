<h2>Translation</h2>
When the King of the elephants saw that he was under the clutches of the crocodile by the will of
providence and, being embodied and circumstantially helpless, could not save himself from danger, he
was extremely afraid of being killed. He consequently thought for a long time and finally reached the
following decision.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Everyone in the material world is engaged in a struggle for existence. Everyone tries to save himself
from danger, but when one is unable to save himself, if he is pious, he then takes shelter of the lotus feet
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.16):
catur-vidha bhajante mam
janah sukrtino 'rjuna
arto jijnasur artharthi
jnani ca bharatarsabha
Four kinds of pious men--namely, one who is in danger, one who is in need of money, one who is
searching for knowledge and one who is inquisitive--begin to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in order to be saved or to advance. The King of the elephants, in his condition of danger,
decided to seek shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. After considerable thought, he intelligently arrived at
this correct decision. Such a decision is not reached by a sinful man. Therefore in Bhagavad-gita it is said
that those who are pious (sukrti) can decide that in a dangerous or awkward condition one should seek
shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna.
