yam dharma-kamartha-vimukti-kama
bhajanta istam gatim apnuvanti
kim casiso raty api deham avyayam
karotu me 'dabhra-dayo vimoksanam
SYNONYMS
yam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead who; dharma-kama-artha-vimukti-kamah--persons who
desire the four principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and salvation; bhajantah--
by worshiping; istam--the objective; gatim--destination; apnuvanti--can achieve; kim--what to speak of;
ca--also; asisah--other benedictions; rati--He bestows; api--even; deham--a body; avyayam--spiritual;
karotu--may He bestow benediction; me--unto me; adabhra-dayah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who is unlimitedly merciful; vimoksanam--liberation from the present danger and from the material
world.
TRANSLATION
After worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, those who are interested in the four principles of
religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation obtain from Him what they desire.
What then is to be said of other benedictions? Indeed, sometimes the Lord gives a spiritual body to such
ambitious worshipers. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unlimitedly merciful, bestow
upon me the benediction of liberation from this present danger and from the materialistic way of life.
PURPORT
Some men within this material world are akami, free from material desire, some are ambitious to get
more and more material profit, and some desire fulfillment in religious life, economic development, sense
gratification and finally liberation.
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
(Bhag. 2.3.10)
It is recommended that whatever one's position--whether one demands no material profit, all material
profit or ultimately liberation--one should offer his obedient devotional service to the Lord, and one will
get what he desires. Krsna is so kind. Ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. The Lord
reciprocates. Whatever even an ordinary living entity wants, Krsna gives. Krsna is situated in everyone's
heart, and He gives that which is desired by the living entity.
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." (Bg. 18.61) The Lord gives
everyone an opportunity to fulfill his ambitions. Even such a devotee as Dhruva Maharaja wanted the
material benediction of a kingdom greater than that of his father, and although he received a spiritual
body, he also got the kingdom, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not disappoint anyone who
takes shelter of His lotus feet. Therefore, since Gajendra, King of the elephants, had surrendered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead to get free from the present danger and, indirectly, from the present
danger of materialistic life, why should the Supreme Personality of Godhead not fulfill his desire?
TEXTS 20-21

SYNONYMS
ekantinah--unalloyed devotees (who have no desire other than Krsna consciousness); yasya--the Lord,
of whom; na--not; kancana--some; artham--benediction; vanchanti--desire; ye--those devotees who; vai--
indeed; bhagavat-prapannah--fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord; ati-adbhutam--which are
wonderful; tat-caritam--the activities of the Lord; su-mangalam--and very auspicious (to hear); gayantah--
by chanting and hearing; ananda--of transcendental bliss; samudra--in the ocean; magnah--who are
immersed; tam--unto Him; aksaram--eternally existing; brahma--the Supreme; param--transcendental;
para-isam--the Lord of the supreme personalities; avyaktam--invisible or not able to be realized by the
mind and senses; adhyatmika--transcendental; yoga--by bhakti-yoga, devotional service; gamyam--
obtainable (bhaktya mam abhijanati); ati-indriyam--beyond the perception of material senses; suksmam--
minute; iva--like; ati-duram--very far away; anantam--unlimited; adyam--the original cause of everything;
paripurnam--completely full; ide--I offer my obeisances.
TRANSLATION
Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and
always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus they always
merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction. I,
however, am in danger. Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing,
who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahma, and who is available only by
transcendental bhakti-yoga. Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and
transcendental to all external realization. He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely
full in everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.
PURPORT
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." Unalloyed devotees have nothing to ask from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was circumstantially asking for an immediate
benediction because he had no other way to be rescued. Sometimes, when there is no alternative, a pure
devotee, being fully dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, prays for some benediction. But in
such a prayer there is also regret. One who always hears and chants about the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord is always situated on a platform on which he has nothing to ask in terms of material benefits.
Unless one is a completely pure devotee, one cannot enjoy the transcendental bliss derived from chanting
and dancing in the ecstasy of the sankirtana movement. Such ecstasy is not possible for an ordinary
devotee. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed us how one can enjoy transcendental bliss simply by
chanting, hearing and dancing in ecstasy. This is bhakti-yoga. Therefore the King of the elephants,
Gajendra, said, adhyatmika-yoga-gamyam, indicating that unless one is situated on this transcendental
platform, one cannot approach the Supreme Lord. The benediction of being able to approach the Lord can
be achieved after many, many births, yet Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has awarded this benediction to
everyone, even to the fallen souls who have no heritage of anything in spiritual life. That is actually being
seen in the Krsna consciousness movement. Therefore the path of bhakti-yoga is the spotless process by
which to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: only through
devotional service can one approach the Supreme Lord. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1):
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
"Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind
attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." Simply by being attached to Krsna
consciousness and by thinking of the lotus feet of Krsna constantly, one can fully understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, without a doubt.

Lord Brahma; devah--and other demigods; vedah--the Vedic knowledge; lokah--different personalities;

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates His minor parts and parcels, the jiva-tattva, beginning with
Lord Brahma, the demigods and the expansions of Vedic knowledge [Sama, Rg, Yajur and Atharva] and
including all other living entities, moving and nonmoving, with their different names and characteristics.
As the sparks of a fire or the shining rays of the sun emanate from their source and merge into it again
and again, the mind, the intelligence, the senses, the gross and subtle material bodies, and the continuous
transformations of the different modes of nature all emanate from the Lord and again merge into Him. He
is neither demigod nor demon, neither human nor bird or beast. He is not woman, man, or neuter, nor is
He an animal. He is not a material quality, a fruitive activity, a manifestation or nonmanifestation. He is
the last word in the discrimination of "not this, not this," and He is unlimited. All glories to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead!
PURPORT
This is a summary description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's unlimited potency. That
supreme one is acting in different phases by manifesting His parts and parcels, which are all
simultaneously differently situated by His different potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). Each and
every potency is acting quite naturally (svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca). Therefore the Lord is unlimited.
Na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate: nothing is equal to Him, nor is anything greater than Him.
Although He manifests Himself in so many ways, personally He has nothing to do (na tasya karyam
karanam ca vidyate), for everything is done by expansions of His unlimited energies.
