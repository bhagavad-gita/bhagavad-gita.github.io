<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
ittham virinca-stuta-karma-viryah
pradurbabhuvamrta-bhur adityam
catur-bhujah sankha-gadabja-cakrah
pisanga-vasa nalinayateksanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; ittham--in this way; virinca-stuta-karma-viryah--the
Personality of Godhead, whose activities and prowess are always praised by Lord Brahma;
pradurbabhuva--became manifested; amrta-bhuh--whose appearance is always deathless; adityam--from
the womb of Aditi; catuh-bhujah--having four arms; sankha-gada-abja-cakrah--decorated with conchshell,
club, lotus and disc; pisanga-vasah--dressed in yellow garments; nalina-ayata-iksanah--having blooming
eyes like the petals of a lotus.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: After Lord Brahma had thus spoken, glorifying the Supreme Lord's activities
and prowess, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never subject to death like an ordinary living
being, appeared from the womb of Aditi. His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and
disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word amrta-bhuh is significant in this verse. The Lord sometimes appears like an ordinary child
taking birth, but this does not mean that He is subject to birth, death or old age. One must be very
intelligent to understand the appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord in His incarnations. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9): janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah. One should try to
understand that the Lord's appearance and disappearance and His activities are all divyam, or
transcendental. The Lord has nothing to do with material activities. One who understands the appearance,
disappearance and activities of the Lord is immediately liberated. After giving up his body, he never again
has to accept a material body, but is transferred to the spiritual world (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti
mam eti so 'rjuna).
