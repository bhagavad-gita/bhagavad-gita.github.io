<h2>Text</h2>
yair iyam bubhuje brahman
daityendrair anivartibhih
tesam kalo 'grasil lokan
na yaso 'dhigatam bhuvi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yaih--by whom; iyam--this world; bubhuje--was enjoyed; brahman--O best of the brahmanas; daityaindraih--
by great heroes and kings born in demoniac families; anivartibhih--by those who were
determined to fight, either to lay down their lives or to win victory; tesam--of such persons; kalah--the
time factor; agrasit--took away; lokan--all possessions, all objects of enjoyment; na--not; yasah--the
reputation; adhigatam--achieved; bhuvi--in this world.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O best of the brahmanas, certainly the great demoniac kings who were never reluctant to fight enjoyed
this world, but in due course of time everything they had was taken away, except their reputation, by
which they continue to exist. In other words, one should try to achieve a good reputation instead of
anything else.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this regard, Canakya Pandita (Canakya-sloka 34) also says, ayusah ksana eko 'pi na labhya svarnakotibhih.
The duration of one's life is extremely short, but if in that short lifetime one can do something
that enhances his good reputation, that may continue to exist for many millions of years. Bali Maharaja
therefore decided not to follow his spiritual master's instruction that he deny his promise to Vamanadeva;
instead, he decided to give the land according to the promise and be everlastingly celebrated as one of the
twelve mahajanas (balir vaiyasakir vayam).
