<h2>Translation</h2>
Since an animal such as I has surrendered unto You, who are supremely liberated, certainly You will
release me from this dangerous position. Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver
me. By your partial feature as Paramatma, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings. You are
celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited. I offer my respectful obeisances
unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words brhate namas te have been explained by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura: brhate srikrsnaya.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Krsna. There are many tattvas, such as visnu-tattva, jivatattva
and sakti-tattva, but above everything is the visnu-tattva, which is all-pervading. This all-pervading
feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained in Bhagavad-gita (10.42), wherein the Lord
says:
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I
pervade and support this entire universe." Thus Krsna says that the entire material world is maintained by
His partial representation as Paramatma. The Lord enters every universe as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and
then expands Himself as Ksirodakasayi Visnu to enter the hearts of all living entities and even enter the
atoms. Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham. Every universe is full of atoms, and the Lord is not
only within the universe but also within the atoms. Thus within every atom the Supreme Lord exists in
His Visnu feature as Paramatma, but all the visnu-tattvas emanate from Krsna. As confirmed in Bhagavadgita
(10.2), aham adir hi devanam: Krsna is the adi, or beginning, of the devas of this material world--
Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. Therefore He is described here as bhagavate brhate. Everyone is
bhagavan--everyone possesses opulence--but Krsna is brhan bhagavan, the possessor of unlimited
opulence. Isvarah paramah krsnah. Krsna is the origin of everyone. Aham sarvasya prabhavah. Even
Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara come from Krsna. Mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: there is
no personality superior to Krsna. Therefore Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that bhagavate brhate
means "unto Sri Krsna."
In this material world, everyone is a pasu, an animal, because of the bodily conception of life.
yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke
sva-dhih kalatradisu bhauma ijya-dhih
yat tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij
janesv abhijnesu sa eva go-kharah
"A human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the self, who considers the byproducts
of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of his birth to be worshipable, and who
goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental knowledge there
is to be considered like a cow or an ass." (Bhag. 10.84.13) Practically everyone, therefore, is a pasu, an
animal, and everyone is attacked by the crocodile of material existence. Not only the King of the elephants
but every one of us is being attacked by the crocodile and is suffering the consequences.
Only Krsna can deliver us from this material existence. Indeed, He is always trying to deliver us. Isvarah
sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati. He is within our hearts and is not at all inattentive. His only aim
is to deliver us from material life. It is not that He becomes attentive to us only when we offer prayers to
Him. Even before we offer our prayers, He incessantly tries to deliver us. He is never lazy in regard to our
deliverance. Therefore this verse says, bhuri-karunaya namo 'layaya. It is the causeless mercy of the
Supreme Lord that He always tries to bring us back home, back to Godhead. God is liberated, and He tries
to make us liberated, but although He is constantly trying, we refuse to accept His instructions (sarvadharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). Nonetheless, He has not become angry. Therefore He is
described here as bhuri-karunaya, unlimitedly merciful in delivering us from this miserable material
condition of life and taking us back home, back to Godhead.
