You will be thoroughly advised and favored by Me, and because of your inquiries, everything about My
glories, which are known as param brahma, will be manifest within your heart. Thus you will know
everything about Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca:
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, is situated in everyone's heart, and from Him come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. The Lord reveals Himself in proportion to one's surrender to
Him. Ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. In responsive cooperation, the Lord reveals
Himself in proportion to one's surrender. That which is revealed to one who fully surrenders is different
from what is revealed to one who surrenders partially. Everyone naturally surrenders to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, either directly or indirectly. The conditioned soul surrenders to the laws of
nature in material existence, but when one fully surrenders to the Lord, material nature does not act upon
him. Such a fully surrendered soul is favored by the Supreme personality of Godhead directly. Mam eva ye
prapadyante mayam etam taranti te. One who has fully surrendered to the Lord has no fear of the modes
of material nature, for everything is but an expansion of the Lord's glories (sarvam khalv idam brahma),
and these glories are gradually revealed and realized. The Lord is the supreme purifier (param brahma
param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan). The more one is purified and the more he wants to know
about the Supreme, the more the Lord reveals to him. Full knowledge of Brahman, Paramatma and
Bhagavan is revealed to the pure devotees. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajnana-jam tamah
nasayamy atma-bhavastho
jnana-dipena bhasvata
"Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge
the darkness born of ignorance."
