<h2>Text</h2>
jijivise naham ihamuya kim
antar bahis cavrtayebha-yonya
icchami kalena na yasya viplavas
tasyatma-lokavaranasya moksam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jijivise--wish to live long; na--not; aham--I; iha--in this life; amuya--or in the next life (I do not wish to
live upon being saved from this dangerous position); kim--what is the value; antah--internally; bahih--
externally; ca--and; avrtaya--covered by ignorance; ibha-yonya--in this birth as an elephant; icchami--I
desire; kalena--because of the influence of time; na--there is not; yasya--of which; viplavah--annihilation;
tasya--that; atma-loka-avaranasya--from the covering of self-realization; moksam--liberation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I do not wish to live anymore after I am released from the attack of the crocodile. What is the use of an
elephant's body covered externally and internally by ignorance? I simply desire eternal liberation from the
covering of ignorance. That covering is not destroyed by the influence of time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this material world, every living entity is covered by the darkness of ignorance. Therefore the Vedas
enjoin that one should approach the Supreme Lord through the spiritual master, who is described and
offered prayers in the Gautamiya-tantra as follows:
om ajnana-timirandhasya
jnananjana-salakaya
caksur unmilitam yena
tasmai sri-gurave namah
"I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has
opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance." Although one may struggle for
existence in this material world, to live forever is impossible. One must understand, however, that this
struggle for existence is due to ignorance, for otherwise every living being is an eternal part of the
Supreme Lord. There is no need to live as an elephant or man, American or Indian; one should desire only
to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Because of ignorance, we consider every life
offered by nature to be happy and pleasing, but in the degraded life within this material world, from the
life of Lord Brahma down to that of an ant, no one can actually be happy. We are making so many plans
to live happily, but there cannot be any happiness in this material world, however we may try to make a
permanent settlement in this life or that.
