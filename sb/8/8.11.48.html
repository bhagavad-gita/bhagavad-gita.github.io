<h2>Text</h2>
balis cosanasa sprstah
pratyapannendriya-smrtih
parajito 'pi nakhidyal
loka-tattva-vicaksanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
balih--Maharaja Bali; ca--also; usanasa--by Sukracarya; sprstah--being touched; pratyapanna--was
brought back; indriya-smrtih--realization of the actions of the senses and memory; parajitah--he was
defeated; api--although; na akhidyat--he did not lament; loka-tattva-vicaksanah--because he was very
experienced in universal affairs.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bali Maharaja was very experienced in universal affairs. When he regained his senses and memory by
the grace of Sukracarya, he could understand everything that had happened. Therefore, although he had
been defeated, he did not lament.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is significant that Bali Maharaja is here said to be very experienced. Although defeated, he was not at
all sorry, for he knew that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Since he was a devotee, he accepted his defeat without lamentation. As stated by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-gita (2.47), karmany evadhikaras te ma phalesu kadacana. Everyone
in Krsna consciousness should execute his duty, without regard for victory or defeat. One must execute
his duty as ordered by Krsna or His representative, the spiritual master. Anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama. In first-class devotional service, one always abides by the orders and will of Krsna.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "King Indra Annihilates the Demons."
Chapter Twelve
The Mohini-murti Incarnation Bewilders Lord Siva
This chapter describes how Lord Siva was bewildered upon seeing the beautiful Mohini-murti
incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how he later came to his senses. When Lord Siva
heard about the pastimes performed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, in the form of an
attractive woman, he mounted his bull and went to see the Lord. Accompanied by his wife, Uma, and his
servants, the bhuta-gana, or ghosts, he approached the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Siva offered obeisances
to the Supreme Lord as the all-pervading Lord, the universal form, the supreme controller of creation, the
Supersoul, the resting place for everyone, and the completely independent cause of all causes. Thus he
offered prayers giving truthful descriptions of the Lord. Then he expressed his desire. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is very kind to His devotees. Therefore, to fulfill the desire of His devotee Lord
Siva, He expanded His energy and manifested Himself in the form of a very beautiful and attractive
woman. Upon seeing this form, even Lord Siva was captivated. Later, by the grace of the Lord, he
controlled himself. This demonstrates that by the power of the Lord's external energy, everyone is
captivated by the form of woman in this material world. Again, however, by the grace of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the influence of maya. This was evinced by Lord Siva, the
topmost devotee of the Lord. First he was captivated, but later, by the grace of the Lord, he restrained
himself. It is declared in this connection that only a pure devotee can restrain himself from the attractive
feature of maya. Otherwise, once a living entity is trapped by the external feature of maya, he cannot
overcome it. After Lord Siva was graced by the Supreme Lord, he circumambulated the Lord along with
his wife, Bhavani, and his companions, the ghosts. Then he left for his own abode. Sukadeva Gosvami
concludes this chapter by describing the transcendental qualities of Uttamasloka, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and by declaring that one can glorify the Lord by nine kinds of devotional service, beginning
with sravanam kirtanam
