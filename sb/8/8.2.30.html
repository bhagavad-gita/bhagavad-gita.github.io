<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tato gajendrasya mano-balaujasam
kalena dirghena mahan abhud vyayah
vikrsyamanasya jale 'vasidato
viparyayo 'bhut sakalam jalaukasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--thereafter; gaja-indrasya--of the King of the elephants; manah--of the strength of enthusiasm;
bala--the physical strength; ojasam--and the strength of the senses; kalena--because of years of fighting;
dirghena--prolonged; mahan--great; abhut--became; vyayah--the expenditure; vikrsyamanasya--who was
being pulled (by the crocodile); jale--into the water (a foreign place); avasidatah--reduced (mental,
physical and sensory strength); viparyayah--the opposite; abhut--became; sakalam--all of them; jalaokasah--
the crocodile, whose home is the water.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant
became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength. The crocodile, on the contrary, being an
animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant
was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water. During one thousand years of fighting, he
could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his
bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful. The crocodile,
however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties. He was getting food and was therefore getting
mental strength and sensual encouragement. Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the
crocodile became more and more powerful. Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with
maya we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight
vigorously. Our Krsna consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in
which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization. The soldiers in this Krsna
consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power. To keep
themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life. What constitutes a
normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of varnasrama--
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Especially in this
age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take sannyasa.
asvamedham gavalambham
sannyasam pala-paitrkam
devarena sutotpattim
kalau panca vivarjayet
(Brahma-vaivarta Purana)
From this we can understand that in this age the sannyasa-asrama is forbidden because people are not
strong. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed us an example in taking sannyasa at the age of twenty-four
years, but even Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya advised Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to be extremely careful
because He had taken sannyasa at an early age. For preaching we give young boys sannyasa, but actually it
is being experienced that they are not fit for sannyasa. There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is
unfit for sannyasa; if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the asrama where sex is allowed,
namely the grhastha-asrama. That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he
should stop fighting the crocodile of maya. One should take shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, as we shall
see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a grhastha if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence.
There is no need to give up the fight. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore recommended, sthane sthitah
sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhih. One may stay in whichever asrama is suitable for him; it is not essential
that one take sannyasa. If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the grhastha-asrama. But one must
continue fighting. For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take sannyasa artificially is not a
very great credit. If sannyasa is not suitable, one may enter the grhastha-asrama and fight maya with great
strength. But one should not give up the fighting and go away.
