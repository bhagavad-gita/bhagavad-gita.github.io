<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; avamah--very little, or insignificant; karma--activities; kalpah--rightly executed; api--even;
viphalaya--go in vain; isvara-arpitah--because of being dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Activities dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if performed in small measure, never
go in vain. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the supreme father, is naturally very dear and
always ready to act for the good of the living entities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (2.40), the Lord says svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: this dharma,
devotional service, is so important that even if performed to a very small, almost negligible extent, it can
give one the supreme result. There are many instances in the history of the world in which even a slight
service rendered to the Lord has saved a living entity from the greatest danger. Ajamila, for example, was
saved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the greatest danger, that of going to hell. He was saved
simply because he chanted the name Narayana at the end of his life. When Ajamila chanted this holy
name of the Lord, Narayana, he did not chant knowingly; actually he was calling his youngest son, whose
name was Narayana. Nonetheless, Lord Narayana took this chanting seriously, and thus Ajamila achieved
the result of ante narayana-smrtih, remembering Narayana at the end of life. If one somehow or other
remembers the holy name of Narayana, Krsna or Rama at the end of life, he immediately achieves the
transcendental result of going back home, back to Godhead.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the only object of our love. As long as we are in this
material world we have so many desires to fulfill, but when we come in touch with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, we immediately become perfect and fully satisfied, just as a child is fully satisfied
when he comes to the lap of his mother. Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest to achieve some material
result by austerity and penance, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, "I
do not want any material benediction. I am completely satisfied." Even if one wants some material benefit
from serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this can be achieved extremely easily, without hard
labor. Therefore the sastra recommends:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is
intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering
transcendental loving service." (Bhag. 2.3.10) Even if one has material desires, one can undoubtedly
achieve what he wants by rendering service to the Lord.
