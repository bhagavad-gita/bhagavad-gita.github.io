<h2>Text</h2>

bhavata bhuri-karmana
baddhas ca varunaih pasair

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasmin--unto You; vaira-anubandhena--by continuously treating as an enemy; vyudhena--firmly fixed
by such intelligence; vibudha-itarah--the demons (those other than the demigods); bahavah--many of
them; lebhire--achieved; siddhim--perfection; yam--which; u ha--it is well known; ekanta-yoginah--equal
to the achievements of the greatly successful mystic yogis; tena--therefore; aham--I; nigrhitah asmi--
although I am being punished; bhavata--by Your Lordship; bhuri-karmana--who can do many wonderful
things; baddhah ca--I am arrested and bound; varunaih pasaih--by the ropes of Varuna; na ati-vride--I am
not at all ashamed of this; na ca vyathe--nor am I suffering very much.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Many demons who were continuously inimical toward You finally achieved the perfection of great
mystic yogis. Your Lordship can perform one work to serve many purposes, and consequently, although
You have punished me in many ways, I do not feel ashamed of having been arrested by the ropes of
Varuna, nor do I feel aggrieved.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja appreciated the Lord's mercy not only upon him but upon many other demons. Because
this mercy is liberally distributed, the Supreme Lord is called all-merciful. Bali Maharaja was indeed a
fully surrendered devotee, but even some demons who were not at all devotees but merely enemies of the
Lord attained the same exalted position achieved by many mystic yogis. Thus Bali Maharaja could
understand that the Lord had some hidden purpose in punishing him. Consequently he was neither
unhappy nor ashamed because of the awkward position in which he had been put by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
