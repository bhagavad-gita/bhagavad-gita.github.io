<h2>Text</h2>
esa me prapitah sthanam
dusprapam amarair api
savarner antarasyayam
bhavitendro mad-asrayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
esah--Bali Maharaja; me--by Me; prapitah--has achieved; sthanam--a place; dusprapam--extremely
difficult to obtain; amaraih api--even by the demigods; savarneh antarasya--during the period of the Manu
known as Savarni; ayam--this Bali Maharaja; bhavita--will become; indrah--the lord of the heavenly
planet; mat-asrayah--completely under My protection.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord continued: Because of his great tolerance, I have given him a place not obtainable even by the
demigods. He will become King of the heavenly planets during the period of the Manu known as Savarni.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if the Lord takes away a devotee's
material opulences, the Lord immediately offers him a position of which the demigods cannot even
dream. There are many examples of this in the history of devotional service. One of them is the opulence
of Sudama Vipra. Sudama Vipra suffered severe material scarcity, but he was not disturbed and did not
deviate from devotional service. Thus he was ultimately given an exalted position by the mercy of Lord
Krsna. Here the word mad-asrayah is very significant. Because the Lord wanted to give Bali Maharaja the
exalted position of Indra, the demigods might naturally have been envious of him and might have fought
to disturb his position. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead assured Bali Maharaja that he would
always remain under the Lord's protection (mad-asrayah).
