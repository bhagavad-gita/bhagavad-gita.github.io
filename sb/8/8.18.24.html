yadrcchayopapannena
santusto vartate sukham
nasantustas tribhir lokair
ajitatmopasaditaih
SYNONYMS
yadrcchaya--as offered by the supreme authority according to one's karma; upapannena--by whatever is
obtained; santustah--one should be satisfied; vartate--there is; sukham--happiness; na--not; asantustah--
one who is dissatisfied; tribhih lokaih--even by possessing the three worlds; ajita-atma--one who cannot
control his senses; upasaditaih--even though obtained.
TRANSLATION
One should be satisfied with whatever he achieves by his previous destiny, for discontent can never
bring happiness. A person who is not self-controlled will not be happy even with possessing the three
worlds.
PURPORT
If happiness is the ultimate goal of life, one must be satisfied with the position in which he is placed by
providence. This instruction is also given by Prahlada Maharaja:
sukham aindriyakam daitya
deha-yogena dehinam
sarvatra labhyate daivad
yatha duhkham ayatnatah
"My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects
by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one's past fruitive activities.
Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress." (Bhag. 7.6.3) This
philosophy is perfect in regard to obtaining happiness.
Real happiness is described in Bhagavad-gita (6.21):
sukham atyantikam yat tad
buddhi-grahyam atindriyam
vetti yatra na caivayam
sthitas calati tattvatah
"In the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself
through transcendental senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth." One has to perceive
happiness by the supersenses. The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements. Every one of
us is a spiritual being (aham brahmasmi), and every one of us is an individual person. Our senses are now
covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to
be our real senses. The real senses, however, are within the material covering. Dehino'smin yatha dehe:
within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tatparatvena
nirmalam: when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy.
Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. When the
senses are engaged in devotional service to Hrsikesa, then the senses are completely satisfied. Without this
superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will
never be possible. One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires
for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve
satisfaction and contentment.
According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special
endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness. Then he will be happy. The purpose of the Krsna
consciousness movement is to spread this understanding. People who do not have scientific spiritual
knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the Krsna consciousness movement are escapists trying
to avoid material activities. In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate
happiness in life. If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense
gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful. Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.1)
therefore recommends:
tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam
suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam
One must practice austerity so that his existential position will be purified and he will achieve unlimited
blissful life.
