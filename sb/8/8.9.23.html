<h2>Text</h2>
tasyam krtatipranayah
pranayapaya-katarah
bahu-manena cabaddha
nocuh kincana vipriyam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasyam--of Mohini-murti; krta-ati-pranayah--because of staunch friendship; pranaya-apaya-katarah--
being afraid that their friendship with Her would be broken; bahu-manena--by great respect and honor;
ca--also; abaddhah--being too attached to Her; na--not; ucuh--they said; kincana--even the slightest thing;
vipriyam--by which Mohini-murti might be displeased with them.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demons had developed affection for Mohini-murti and a kind of faith in Her, and they were afraid
of disturbing their relationship. Therefore they showed respect and honor to Her words and did not say
anything that might disturb their friendship with Her.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demons were so captivated by the tricks and friendly words of Mohini-murti that although the
demigods were served first, the demons were pacified merely by sweet words. The Lord said to the
demons, "The demigods are very miserly and are excessively anxious to take the nectar first. So let them
have it first. Since you are not like them you can wait a little longer. You are all heroes and are so pleased
with Me. It is better for you to wait until after the demigods drink."
