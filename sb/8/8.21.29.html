<h2>Translation</h2>
One who is subject to death cannot measure the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Trivikrama, Lord Visnu, any more than he can count the number of atoms on the entire planet earth. No
one, whether born already or destined to take birth, is able to do this. This has been sung by the great sage
Vasistha.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vasistha Muni has given a mantra about Lord Visnu: na te visnor jayamano na jato mahimnah param
anantam apa. No one can estimate the extent of the uncommonly glorious activities of Lord Visnu.
Unfortunately, there are so-called scientists who are subject to death at every moment but are trying to
understand by speculation the wonderful creation of the cosmos. This is a foolish attempt. Long, long ago,
Vasistha Muni said that no one in the past could measure the glories of the Lord and that no one can do
so in the future. One must simply be satisfied with seeing the glorious activities of the Supreme Lord's
creation. The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (10.42), vistabhyaham idam krtsnam ekamsena sthito
jagat: "With a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire universe." The material world
consists of innumerable universes, each one full of innumerable planets, which are all considered to be
products of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's material energy. Yet this is only one fourth of God's
creation. The other three fourths of creation constitute the spiritual world. Among the innumerable
planets in only one universe, the so-called scientists cannot understand even the moon and Mars, but they
try to defy the creation of the Supreme Lord and His uncommon energy. Such men have been described as
crazy. Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma (Bhag. 5.5.4). Such crazy men unnecessarily waste time, energy
and money in attempting to defy the glorious activities of Urukrama, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
