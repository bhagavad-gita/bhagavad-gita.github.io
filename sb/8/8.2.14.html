athagre rsayah karmanihante
'karma-hetave
ihamano hi purusah
prayo 'niham prapadyate
SYNONYMS
atha--therefore; agre--in the beginning; rsayah--all learned rsis, saintly persons; karmani--fruitive
activities; ihante--execute; akarma--freedom from fruitive results; hetave--for the purpose of; ihamanah--
engaging in such activities; hi--indeed; purusah--a person; prayah--almost always; aniham--liberation
from karma; prapadyate--attains.
TRANSLATION
Therefore, to enable people to reach the stage of activities that are not tinged by fruitive results, great
saints first engage people in fruitive activities, for unless one begins by performing activities as
recommended in the sastras, one cannot reach the stage of liberation, or activities that produce no
reactions.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (3.9) Lord Krsna advises, yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah:
"Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material
world." Generally, everyone is attracted to hard labor for becoming happy in this material world, but
although various activities are going on all over the world simply for the sake of happiness, unfortunately
only problems are being created from such fruitive activities. Therefore it is advised that active persons
engage in activities of Krsna consciousness, which are called yajna, because then they will gradually come
to the platform of devotional service. Yajna means Lord Visnu, the yajna-purusa, the enjoyer of all
sacrifices (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram). The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
actually the enjoyer, and therefore if we begin our activities for His satisfaction, we will gradually lose our
taste for material activities.
Suta Gosvami declared to the great assembly of sages at Naimisaranya:
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
"O best among the twice-born, it is concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by
discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the
Lord Hari." (Bhag. 1.2.13) According to Vedic principles, everyone must act according to his classification
as brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi. Everyone should
progress toward perfection by acting in such a way that Krsna will be pleased (samsiddhir hari-tosanam).
One cannot please Krsna by sitting idly; one must act according to the directions of the spiritual master
for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then one will gradually come to the
stage of pure devotional service. As confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.12):
naiskarmyam apy acyuta-bhava-varjitam
na sobhate jnanam alam niranjanam
"Knowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid
of a conception of the infallible [God]." Jnanis recommend that one adopt naiskarmya by not doing
anything but simply meditating and thinking of Brahman, but this is impossible unless one realizes
Parabrahman, Krsna. If there is no Krsna consciousness, any kind of activity, be it philanthropic, political
or social, simply causes karma-bandhana, bondage to material work.
As long as one is entangled in karma-bandhana, one must accept different types of bodies that spoil the
human form of facility. Therefore, in Bhagavad-gita (6.3) karma-yoga is recommended:
aruruksor muner yogam
karma karanam ucyate
yogarudhasya tasyaiva
samah karanam ucyate
"For one who is a neophyte in the yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has
already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means." Nonetheless:
karmendriyani samyamya
ya aste manasa smaran
indriyarthan vimudhatma
mithyacarah sa ucyate
"One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly
deludes himself and is called a pretender." (Bg. 3.6) One should act for Krsna very seriously in order to
become fully Krsna conscious and should not sit down to imitate such great personalities as Haridasa
Thakura. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura condemned such imitation. Me said:
dusta mana! tumi kisera vaisnava?
pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare,
tava hari-nama kevala kaitava
"My dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration, you sit in a solitary place
and pretend to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, but this is all cheating." Recently at Mayapur an
African devotee wanted to imitate Haridasa Thakura, but after fifteen days he became restless and went
away. Do not suddenly try to imitate Haridasa Thakura. Engage yourself in Krsna conscious activities, and
gradually you will come to the stage of liberation (muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih).
