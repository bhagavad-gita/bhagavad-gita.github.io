mithah kalir abhut tesam

aham purvam aham purvam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mithah--among themselves; kalih--disagreement and quarrel; abhut--there was; tesam--of all of them;
tat-arthe--for the sake of nectar; tarsa-cetasam--bewildered in heart and soul by the illusory energy of
Visnu; aham--I; purvam--first; aham--I; purvam--first; na--not; tvam--you; na--not; tvam--you; iti--thus;
prabho--O King.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, a quarrel then arose among the demons over who would get the nectar first. Each of them said,
"You cannot drink it first. I must drink it first. Me first, not you!"
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the symptom of demons. The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense
gratification at once, whereas the devotee's first concern is to satisfy the Lord. This is the distinction
between the nondevotee and the devotee. In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they
regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his
own senses. Therefore, unless such demons become Krsna conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses
of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods.
The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is
always anxious to satisfy their ambitions. While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees
engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord. The members of the Krsna consciousness
movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the Krsna consciousness
movement will be successful.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Some of the demons said, "All the demigods have taken part in churning the ocean of milk. Now, as
everyone has an equal right to partake in any public sacrifice, according to the eternal religious system it
is befitting that the demigods now have a share of the nectar." O King, in this way the weaker demons
forbade the stronger demons to take the nectar.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Desiring to take the nectar, those among the demons who were less strong spoke in favor of the
demigods. The weaker Daityas naturally pleaded on behalf of the demigods to stop the stronger Daityas
from drinking the nectar without sharing it. In this way, disagreement and trouble arose as they forbade
one another to drink the nectar.

<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who can counteract any unfavorable situation, then
assumed the form of an extremely beautiful woman. This incarnation as a woman, Mohini-murti, was
most pleasing to the mind. Her complexion resembled in color a newly grown blackish lotus, and every
part of Her body was beautifully situated. Her ears were equally decorated with earrings, Her cheeks were
very beautiful, Her nose was raised and Her face full of youthful luster. Her large breasts made Her waist
seem very thin. Attracted by the aroma of Her face and body, bumblebees hummed around Her, and thus
Her eyes were restless. Her hair, which was extremely beautiful, was garlanded with mallika flowers. Her
attractively constructed neck was decorated with a necklace and other ornaments, Her arms were
decorated with bangles, Her body was covered with a clean sari, and Her breasts seemed like islands in an
ocean of beauty. Her legs were decorated with ankle bells. Because of the movements of Her eyebrows as
She smiled with shyness and glanced over the demons, all the demons were saturated with lusty desires,
and every one of them desired to possess Her.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because of the Supreme Lord's assuming the form of a beautiful woman to arouse the lusty desires of the
demons, a description of Her complete beauty is given here.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Churning of the Milk Ocean."
Chapter Nine
The Lord Incarnates as Mohini-Murti
This chapter describes how the demons, being enchanted by the beauty of the Mohini form, agreed to
hand over the container of nectar to Mohinidevi, who tactfully delivered it to the demigods.
When the demons got possession of the container of nectar, an extraordinarily beautiful young woman
appeared before them. All the demons became captivated by the young woman's beauty and became
attached to Her. Now, because the demons were fighting among themselves to possess the nectar, they
selected this beautiful woman as a mediator to settle their quarrel. Taking advantage of their weakness in
this regard, Mohini, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, got the demons to promise
that whatever decision She might give, they would not refuse to accept it. When the demons made this
promise, the beautiful woman, Mohini-murti, had the demigods and demons sit in different lines so that
She could distribute the nectar. She knew that the demons were quite unfit to drink the nectar. Therefore,
by cheating them She distributed all the nectar to the demigods. When the demons saw this cheating of
Mohini-murti, they remained silent. But one demon, named Rahu, dressed himself like a demigod and sat
down in the line of the demigods. He sat beside the sun and the moon. When the Supreme Personality of
Godhead understood how Rahu was cheating, He immediately cut off the demon's head. Rahu, however,
had already tasted the nectar, and therefore although his head was severed, he remained alive. After the
demigods finished drinking the nectar, the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed His own form.
Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing how powerful is the chanting of the holy names,
pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
