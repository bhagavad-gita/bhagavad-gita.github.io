<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma, along with Lord Siva, saw the crystal-clear personal beauty of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, whose blackish body resembles a marakata gem, whose eyes are reddish like the depths of a
lotus, who is dressed with garments that are yellow like molten gold, and whose entire body is attractively
decorated. They saw His beautiful, smiling, lotuslike face, crowned by a helmet bedecked with valuable
jewels. The Lord has attractive eyebrows, and His cheeks are adorned with earrings. Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva saw the belt on the Lord's waist, the bangles on Mis arms, the necklace on His chest, and the
ankle bells on His legs. The Lord is bedecked with flower garlands, His neck is decorated with the
Kaustubha gem, and He carries with Him the goddess of fortune and His personal weapons, like His disc
and club. When Lord Brahma, along with Lord Siva and the other demigods, thus saw the form of the
Lord, they all immediately fell to the ground, offering their obeisances.
