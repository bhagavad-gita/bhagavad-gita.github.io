<h2>Text</h2>
manvantare harer janma
karmani ca mahiyasah
grnanti kavayo brahmams
tani no vada srnvatam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
manvantare--during the change of manvantaras (one Manu following another); hareh--of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; janma--appearance; karmani--and activities; ca--also; mahiyasah--of the
supremely glorified; grnanti--describe; kavayah--the great learned persons who have perfect intelligence;
brahman--O learned brahmana (Sukadeva Gosvami); tani--all of them; nah--to us; vada--please describe;
srnvatam--who are very eager to hear.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O learned brahmana, Sukadeva Gosvami, the great learned persons who are completely intelligent
describe the activities and appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead during the various
manvantaras. We are very eager to hear about these narrations. Kindly describe them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has different varieties of incarnations, including the guna-avataras,
manvantara-avataras, lila-avataras and yuga-avataras, all of which are described in the sastras. Without
reference to the sastras there can be no question of accepting anyone as an incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore, as especially mentioned here, grnanti kavayah: the descriptions of
various incarnations are accepted by great learned scholars with perfect intelligence. At the present time,
especially in India, so many rascals are claiming to be incarnations, and people are being misled.
Therefore, the identity of an incarnation should be confirmed by the descriptions of the sastras and by
wonderful activities. As described in this verse by the word mahiyasah, the activities of an incarnation are
not ordinary magic or jugglery, but are wonderful activities. Thus any incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead must be supported by the statements of the sastra and must actually perform
wonderful activities. Pariksit Maharaja was eager to hear about the Manus of different ages. There are
fourteen Manus during a day of Brahma, and the age of each Manu lasts for seventy-one yugas. Thus there
are thousands of Manus during the life of Brahma.
