Sri Suta Gosvami said: O brahmanas, when Pariksit Maharaja, who was awaiting impending death, thus

respect to the King and spoke with great pleasure in the assembly of sages, who desired to hear him.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Manus, Administrators of the Universe."
Chapter Two
The Elephant Gajendra's Crisis
The Second, Third and Fourth Chapters of this canto describe how the Lord, during the reign of the
fourth Manu, gave protection to the king of the elephants. As described in this Second Chapter, when the
King of the elephants, along with his female elephants, was enjoying in the water, a crocodile suddenly
attacked him, and the elephant surrendered to the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead for protection.
In the midst of the ocean of milk, there is a very high and beautiful mountain that has an altitude of ten
thousand yojanas, or eighty thousand miles. This mountain is known as Trikuta. In a valley of Trikuta
there is a nice garden named Rtumat, which was constructed by Varuna, and in that area there is a very
nice lake. Once the chief of the elephants, along with female elephants, went to enjoy bathing in that lake,
and they disturbed the inhabitants of the water. Because of this, the chief crocodile in that water, who was
very powerful, immediately attacked the elephant's leg. Thus there ensued a great fight between the
elephant and the crocodile. This fight continued for one thousand years. Neither the elephant nor the
crocodile died, but since they were in the water, the elephant gradually became weak whereas the power
of the crocodile increased more and more. Thus the crocodile became more and more encouraged. Then
the elephant, being helpless and seeing that there was no other way for his protection, sought shelter at
the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
