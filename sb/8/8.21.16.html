<h2>Text</h2>
mantratas tantratas chidram
desa-kalarha-vastutah
sarvam karoti nischidram
anusankirtanam tava
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mantratah--in pronouncing the Vedic mantras improperly; tantratah--in insufficient knowledge for
following regulative principles; chidram--discrepancy; desa--in the matter of country; kala--and time;
arha--and recipient; vastutah--and paraphernalia; sarvam--all these; karoti--makes; nischidram--without
discrepancy; anusankirtanam--constantly chanting the holy name; tava--of Your Lordship.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There may be discrepancies in pronouncing the mantras and observing the regulative principles, and,
moreover, there may be discrepancies in regard to time, place, person and paraphernalia. But when Your
Lordship's holy name is chanted, everything becomes faultless.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the
Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." (Brhan-naradiya Purana
38.126) In this age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices
perfectly. Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic mantras with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the
paraphernalia for Vedic performances. Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is sankirtana,
constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag.
11.5.29). Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess
good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord's holy name and thus perform sacrifice
perfectly. I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing yajnas and spending
hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances. This is a lesson for those who
unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices. We should take the advice of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
(yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). Although Sukracarya was a strict brahmana addicted
to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, nischidram anusankirtanam tava: "My Lord, constant chanting of
the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect." In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies
cannot be performed as perfectly as before. Therefore Srila Jiva Gosvami has recommended that although
one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of
the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy
name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our Krsna consciousness movement we therefore give
special stress to the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra in all activities.
