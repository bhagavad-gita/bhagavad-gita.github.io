guna--by the three gunas, the modes of material nature (sattva, rajas and tamas); arani--by arani wood;
channa--covered; cit--of knowledge; usmapaya--unto He whose fire; tat-ksobha--of the agitation of the
modes of material nature; visphurjita--outside; manasaya--unto He whose mind; naiskarmya-bhavena--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, as the fire in arani wood is covered, You and Your unlimited knowledge are covered by the
material modes of nature. Your mind, however, is not attentive to the activities of the modes of nature.
Those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge are not subject to the regulative principles directed in the
Vedic literatures. Because such advanced souls are transcendental, You personally appear in their pure
minds. Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (10.11) it is said:
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajnana-jam tamah
nasayamy atma-bhava stho
jnana-dipena bhasvata
For a devotee who has taken the lotus feet of the Lord within his heart, the Lord gives spiritual
enlightenment, known as jnana-dipa, by special mercy from within. This jnana-dipa is compared to the
fire hidden within arani wood. To perform fire sacrifices, great sages previously did not ignite a fire
directly; the fire would be invoked from arani wood. Similarly, all living entities are covered by the modes
of material nature, and the fire of knowledge can be ignited only by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
when one takes Him within one's heart. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. If one takes seriously the
lotus feet of Krsna, who is seated within one's heart, the Lord eradicates all ignorance. By the torch of
knowledge, one immediately understands everything properly by the special mercy of the Supreme Lord
and becomes self-realized. In other words, although a devotee may externally not be very well educated,
because of his devotional service the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives him enlightenment from
within. If the Lord gives enlightenment from within, how can one be in ignorance? Therefore the
allegation of the Mayavadis that the devotional path is for the unintelligent or uneducated is untrue.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
If one becomes an unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Lord, he automatically manifests all good qualities.
Such a devotee is above the instructions of the Vedas. He is a paramahamsa. Even without going through
the Vedic literature, a devotee becomes pure and enlightened by the mercy of the Lord. "Therefore, my
Lord," the devotee says, "I offer my respectful obeisances unto You."
