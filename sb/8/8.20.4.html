<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
pumsam slaghyatamam manye
dandam arhattamarpitam
yam na mata pita bhrata
suhrdas cadisanti hi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pumsam--of men; slaghya-tamam--the most exalted; manye--I consider; dandam--punishment;
arhattama-arpitam--given by You, the supreme worshipable Lord; yam--which; na--neither; mata--mother;
pita--father; bhrata--brother; suhrdah--friends; ca--also; adisanti--offer; hi--indeed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although a father, mother, brother or friend may sometimes punish one as a well-wisher, they never
punish their subordinate like this. But because You are the most worshipable Lord, I regard the
punishment You have given me as most exalted.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Punishment meted out by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted by the devotee as the greatest
mercy.
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
"One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of
his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who
always offers obeisances to You is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation." (Bhag. 10.14.8) A
devotee knows that so-called punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is only His favor to
correct His devotee and bring him to the right path. Therefore the punishment awarded by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to even the greatest benefit awarded by one's material father,
mother, brother or friend.
