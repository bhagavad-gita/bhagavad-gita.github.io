<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is very merciful to the poor, will fulfill all of your desires, for
devotional service unto Him is infallible. Any method other than devotional service is useless. That is my
opinion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three kinds of men, who are called akama, moksa-kama and sarva-kama. One who tries to get
liberation from this material world is called moksa-kama, one who wants to enjoy this material world to
its fullest extent is called sarva-kama, and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material
desires is called akama. A bhakta has no desire. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam. He is
purified and free from material desires. The moksa-kami wants to achieve liberation by merging into the
existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he
is not yet pure. And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the karmis, who have so
many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the sastra says:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is
intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering
transcendental loving service." (Bhag. 2.3.10)
Kasyapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he
advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words,
everyone, regardless of whether he is a karmi, jnani, yogi or bhakta, should invariably take shelter of the
lotus feet of Vasudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be
duly fulfilled. Krsna is dina-anukampana: He is very merciful to everyone. Therefore if one wants to fulfill
his material desires, Krsna helps him. Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a
special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed
devotional service. It is said in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.38-39):
krsna kahe,----'ama bhaje, mage visaya-sukha
amrta chadi' visa mage,----ei bada murkha
ami----vijna, ei murkhe 'visaya' kene diba?
sva-caranamrta diya 'visaya' bhulaiba
"Krsna says, 'If one engages in My transcendental loving service but at the same time wants the
opulence of material enjoyment, he is very, very foolish. Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up
ambrosia to drink poison. Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity?
Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory
material enjoyment.' " If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely
desires to engage at the lotus feet of Krsna, Krsna may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and
take away all his material desires and possessions. This is the Lord's special favor to devotees. Otherwise,
if one takes to Krsna's devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from
all material desires, as Dhruva Maharaja did, but this may take some time. However, if a very sincere
devotee wants only Krsna's lotus feet, Krsna directly gives him the position of suddha-bhakti, unalloyed
devotional service.
