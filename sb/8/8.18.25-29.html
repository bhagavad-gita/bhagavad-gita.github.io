<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, on the heart of Lord Murari he saw religion; on the chest, both pleasing words and
truthfulness; in the mind, the moon; on the bosom, the goddess of fortune, with a lotus flower in her
hand; on the neck, all the Vedas and all sound vibrations; on the arms, all the demigods, headed by King
Indra; in both ears, all the directions; on the head, the upper planetary systems; on the hair, the clouds; in
the nostrils, the wind; on the eyes, the sun; and in the mouth, fire. From His words came all the Vedic
mantras, on His tongue was the demigod of water, Varunadeva, on His eyebrows were the regulative
principles, and on His eyelids were day and night. [When His eyes were open it was daytime, and when
they were closed it was night.] On His forehead was anger, and on His lips was greed. O King, in His
touch were lusty desires, in His semen were all the waters, on His back was irreligion, and in His
wonderful activities or steps was the fire of sacrifice. On His shadow was death, in His smile was the
illusory energy, and on the hairs of His body were all the drugs and herbs. In His veins were all the rivers,
on His nails were all the stones, in His intelligence were Lord Brahma, the demigods and the great saintly
persons, and throughout His entire body and senses were all living entities, moving and stationary. Bali
Maharaja thus saw everything in the gigantic body of the Lord.
