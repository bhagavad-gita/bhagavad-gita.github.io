<h2>Translation</h2>
In flattering a woman to bring her under control, in joking, in a marriage ceremony, in earning one's
livelihood, when one's life is in danger, in protecting cows and brahminical culture, or in protecting a
person from an enemy's hand, falsity is never condemned.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Nineteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled, "Lord Vamanadeva Begs Charity from Bali Maharaja."
Chapter Twenty
Bali Maharaja Surrenders the Universe
The summary of this Twentieth Chapter is as follows. Despite his knowledge that Lord Vamanadeva was
cheating him, Bali Maharaja gave everything to the Lord in charity, and thus the Lord extended His body
and assumed a gigantic form as Lord Visnu.
After hearing the instructive advice of Sukracarya, Bali Maharaja became contemplative. Because it is the
duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion, economic development and sense
gratification, Bali Maharaja thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the brahmacari. To lie or fail
to honor a promise given to a brahmacari is never proper, for lying is the most sinful activity. Everyone
should be afraid of the sinful reactions to lying, for mother earth cannot even bear the weight of a sinful
liar. The spreading of a kingdom or empire is temporary; if there is no benefit for the general public, such
expansion has no value. Previously, all the great kings and emperors expanded their kingdoms with a
regard for the welfare of the people in general. Indeed, while engaged in such activities for the benefit of
the general public, eminent men sometimes even sacrificed their lives. It is said that one who is glorious
in his activities is always living and never dies. Therefore, fame should be the aim of life, and even if one
becomes poverty-stricken for the sake of a good reputation, that is not a loss. Bali Maharaja thought that
even if this brahmacari, Vamanadeva, were Lord Visnu, if the Lord accepted his charity and then again
arrested him, Bali Maharaja would not envy Him. Considering all these points, Bali Maharaja finally gave
in charity everything he possessed.
Lord Vamanadeva then immediately extended Himself into a universal body. By the mercy of Lord
Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja could see that the Lord is all-pervading and that everything rests in His body.
Bali Maharaja could see Lord Vamanadeva as the supreme Visnu, wearing a helmet, yellow garments, the
mark of Srivatsa, the Kaustubha jewel, a flower garland, and ornaments decorating His entire body. The
Lord gradually covered the entire surface of the world, and by extending His body He covered the entire
sky. With His hands He covered all directions, and with His second footstep He covered the entire upper
planetary system. Therefore there was no vacant place where He could take His third footstep.
