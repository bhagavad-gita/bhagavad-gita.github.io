namah--I offer my respectful obeisances; namah--again I offer my respectful obeisances; te--unto You;
akhila-karanaya--unto the supreme cause of everything; niskaranaya--unto You who are causeless;
adbhuta-karanaya--the wonderful cause of everything; sarva--all; agama-amnaya--unto the source of the
parampara system of all Vedic knowledge; maha-arnavaya--the great ocean of knowledge, or the great
ocean wherein all the rivers of knowledge merge; namah--I offer my obeisances; apavargaya--unto You

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are the cause of all causes, but You Yourself have no cause. Therefore You are the
wonderful cause of everything. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic
knowledge contained in the sastras like the Pancaratras and Vedanta-sutra, which are Your
representations, and who are the source of the parampara system. Because it is You who can give
liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto
You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described herein as the wonderful cause. He is wonderful in the
sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead
(janmady asya yatah), He always remains complete (purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate). In our
experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money
from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the
Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from
Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. Purnasya purnam adaya purnam
evavasisyate. Therefore He is the wonderful cause. Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami.
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." (Brahma-samhita
5.1)
Even in this material world, we can understand that the sun has existed for millions of years and has
given off heat and light since its creation, yet the sun still retains its power and never changes. What then
is to be said of the supreme cause, param brahma, Krsna? Everything emanates from Him perpetually, yet
He maintains His original form (sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah). Krsna personally says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8),
mattah sarvam pravartate: "Everything emanates from Me." Everything emanates from Krsna eternally, yet
He is the same Krsna and does not change. Therefore He is the shelter of all transcendentalists who are
eager to get free from material bondage.
Everyone must take shelter of Krsna. It is therefore advised:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is
intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering
transcendental loving service." (Bhag. 2.3.10) Param brahma, the Supreme Lord, and param dhama, the
supreme repose, is Krsna. Therefore anyone who desires anything--whether he be a karmi, a jnani or a
yogi--should try to perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead very seriously, and all of his desires will
be fulfilled. The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: "As the living entities
surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly." Even the karmi who wants everything for his enjoyment
can get it from Krsna. For Krsna, supplying what he wants is not at all difficult. Actually, however, one
should worship Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the sake of getting liberation.
Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah. By studying the Vedic literature, one should understand Krsna. As
confirmed here, sarvagamamnaya-maharnavaya. He is the ocean, and all Vedic knowledge flows toward
Him. Therefore, intelligent transcendentalists take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarvadharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). This is the ultimate goal.
