madhyam--middle; ca--also; svah--own; parah--others; na--nor; antaram--inside; bahih--outside; visvasya--
of the whole cosmic manifestation; amuni--all such considerations; yat--whose form; yasmat--from He

very, very great.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no beginning, no end and no middle. Nor does He belong to a
particular person or nation. He has no inside or outside. The dualities found within this material world,
such as beginning and end, mine and theirs, are all absent from the personality of the Supreme Lord. The
universe, which emanates from Him, is another feature of the Lord. Therefore the Supreme Lord is the
ultimate truth, and He is complete in greatness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described in the Brahma-samhita (5.1):
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is
the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." For the Lord's existence
there is no cause, for He is the cause of everything. He is in everything (maya tatam idam sarvam), He is
expanded in everything, but He is not everything. He is acintya-bhedabheda, simultaneously one and
different. That is explained in this verse. In the material condition we have a conception of beginning, end
and middle, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead there are no such things. The universal cosmic
manifestation is also the virat-rupa that was shown to Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, since the Lord
is present everywhere and all the time, He is the Absolute Truth and the greatest. He is complete in
greatness. God is great, and how He is great is explained here.
