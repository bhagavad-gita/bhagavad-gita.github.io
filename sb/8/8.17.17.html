<h2>Text</h2>

vadanyaj jagad-isvarat
nainah prapnoti vai vidvan
yavad-artha-pratigrahah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; anyat--anything else; te--from you; kamaye--I beg; rajan--O King; vadanyat--who are so
munificent; jagat-isvarat--who are the king of the entire universe; na--not; enah--distress; prapnoti--gets;
vai--indeed; vidvan--one who is learned; yavat-artha--as much as one needs; pratigrahah--taking charity
from others.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, controller of the entire universe, although you are very munificent and are able to give Me as
much land as I want, I do not want anything from you that is unnecessary. If a learned brahmana takes
charity from others only according to his needs, he does not become entangled in sinful activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A brahmana or sannyasi is qualified to ask charity from others, but if he takes more than necessary he is
punishable. No one can use more of the Supreme Lord's property than necessary. Lord Vamanadeva
indirectly indicated to Bali Maharaja that he was occupying more land than he needed. In the material
world, all distresses are due to extravagance. One acquires money extravagantly and also spends it
extravagantly. Such activities are sinful. All property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and
all living beings, who are sons of the Supreme Lord, have the right to use the Supreme Father's property,
but one cannot take more than necessary. This principle should especially be followed by brahmanas and
sannyasis who live at the cost of others. Thus Vamanadeva was an ideal beggar, for He asked only three
paces of land. Of course, there is a difference between His footsteps and those of an ordinary human
being. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His inconceivable prowess, can occupy the entire
universe, including the upper, lower and middle planetary systems, by the unlimited measurement of His
footsteps.
