api--also; parsada-gatim--the position of the Lord's associate; gamitena--who had already gotten; yuktah--
accompanied; gandharva--by the denizens of Gandharvaloka; siddha--the denizens of Siddhaloka;

<h2>Translation</h2>
Upon delivering the King of the elephants from the clutches of the crocodile, and from material
existence, which resembles a crocodile, the Lord awarded him the status of sarupya-mukti. In the
presence of the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the other demigods, who were praising the Lord for His
wonderful transcendental activities, the Lord, sitting on the back of His carrier, Garuda, returned to His
all-wonderful abode and took Gajendra with Him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word vimoksya is significant. For a devotee, moksa or mukti--salvation--means getting
the position of the Lord's associate. The impersonalists are satisfied to get the liberation of merging in the
Brahman effulgence, but for a devotee, mukti (liberation) means not to merge in the effulgence of the
Lord, but to be directly promoted to the Vaikuntha planets and to become an associate of the Lord. In this
regard, there is a relevant verse in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak
"One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of
his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who
always offers obeisances unto You, is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation." A devotee who
tolerates everything in this material world and patiently executes his devotional service can become
mukti-pade sa daya-bhak, a bona fide candidate for liberation. The word daya-bhak refers to a hereditary
right to the Lord's mercy. A devotee must simply engage in devotional service, not caring about material
situations. Then he automatically becomes a rightful candidate for promotion to Vaikunthaloka. The
devotee who renders unalloyed service to the Lord gets the right to be promoted to Vaikunthaloka, just as
a son inherits the property of his father.
When a devotee gets liberation, he becomes free from material contamination and engages as a servant
of the Lord. This is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena
vyavasthitih. The word svarupa refers to sarupya-mukti--going back home, back to Godhead, and
remaining the Lord's eternal associate, having regained a spiritual body exactly resembling that of the
Lord, with four hands, holding the sankha, cakra, gada and padma. The difference between the mukti of
the impersonalist and that of the devotee is that the devotee is immediately appointed an eternal servant
of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist, although merging in the effulgence of the brahmajyoti, is still
insecure and therefore generally falls again to this material world. Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag. 10.2.32). Although the impersonalist rises to the Brahman
effulgence and enters into that effulgence, he has no engagement in the service of the Lord, and therefore
he is again attracted to materialistic philanthropic activities. Thus he comes down to open hospitals and
educational institutions, feed poor men and perform similar materialistic activities, which the
impersonalist thinks are more precious than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anadrtayusmad-
anghrayah. The impersonalists do not think that the service of the Lord is more valuable than
serving the poor man or starting a school or hospital. Although they say brahma satyam jagan
mithya--"Brahman is real, and the material world is false"--they are nonetheless very eager to serve the
false material world and neglect the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
