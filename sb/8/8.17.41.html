<h2>Text</h2>
parag riktam apurnam va
aksaram yat tad om iti
yat kincid om iti bruyat
tena ricyeta vai puman
bhiksave sarvam om kurvan
nalam kamena catmane
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
parak--that which separates; riktam--that which makes one free from attachment; apurnam--that which
is insufficient; va--either; aksaram--this syllable; yat--that; tat--which; om--omkara; iti--thus stated; yat--
which; kincit--whatever; om--this word om; iti--thus; bruyat--if you say; tena--by such an utterance;
ricyeta--one becomes free; vai--indeed; puman--a person; bhiksave--unto a beggar; sarvam--everything;
om kurvan--giving charity by uttering the word om; na--not; alam--sufficiently; kamena--for sense
gratification; ca--also; atmane--for self-realization.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The utterance of the word om signifies separation from one's monetary assets. In other words, by
uttering this word one becomes free from attachment to money because his money is taken away from
him. To be without money is not very satisfactory, for in that position one cannot fulfill one's desires. In
other words, by using the word om one becomes poverty-stricken. Especially when one gives charity to a
poor man or beggar, one remains unfulfilled in self-realization and in sense gratification.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Bali wanted to give everything to Vamanadeva, who had appeared as a beggar, but Sukracarya,
being Maharaja Bali's familial spiritual master in the line of seminal succession, could not appreciate
Maharaja Bali's promise. Sukracarya gave Vedic evidence that one should not give everything to a poor
man. Rather, when a poor man comes for charity one should untruthfully say, "Whatever I have I have
given you. I have no more." It is not that one should give everything to him. Actually the word om is
meant for om tat sat, the Absolute Truth. Omkara is meant for freedom from all attachment to money
because money should be spent for the purpose of the Supreme. The tendency of modern civilization is to
give money in charity to the poor. Such charity has no spiritual value because we actually see that
although there are so many hospitals and other foundations and institutions for the poor, according to the
three modes of material nature a class of poor men is always destined to continue. Even though there are
so many charitable institutions, poverty has not been driven from human society. Therefore it is
recommended here, bhiksave sarvam om kurvan nalam kamena catmane. One should not give everything
to the beggars among the poor.
The best solution is that of the Krsna consciousness movement. This movement is always kind to the
poor, not only because it feeds them but also because it gives them enlightenment by teaching them how
to become Krsna conscious. We are therefore opening hundreds and thousands of centers for those who
are poor, both in money and in knowledge, to enlighten them in Krsna consciousness and reform their
character by teaching them how to avoid illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, which are the
most sinful activities and which cause people to suffer, life after life. The best way to use money is to open
such a center, where all may come live and reform their character. They may live very comfortably,
without denial of any of the body's necessities, but they live under spiritual control, and thus they live
happily and save time for advancement in Krsna consciousness. If one has money, it should not be
squandered away on nothing. It should be used to push forward the Krsna consciousness movement so
that all of human society will become happy, prosperous and hopeful of being promoted back home, back
to Godhead. The Vedic mantra in this regard reads as follows:
parag va etad riktam aksaram yad etad om iti tad yat kincid om iti ahatraivasmai tad ricyate; sa yat sarvam
om kuryad ricyad atmanam sa kamebhyo nalam syat.
