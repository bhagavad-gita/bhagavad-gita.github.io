O son of a brahmana, it appears that You have come here to ask me for something. Therefore, whatever
You want You may take from me. O best of those who are worshipable. You may take from me a cow,
gold, a furnished house, palatable food and drink, the daughter of a brahmana for Your wife, prosperous
villages, horses, elephants, chariots or whatever You desire.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Lord Vamanadeva, the Dwarf Incarnation."
Chapter Nineteen
Lord Vamanadeva Begs Charity from Bali Maharaja
This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva asked for three paces of land in charity, how
Bali Maharaja agreed to His proposal, and how Sukracarya forbade Bali Maharaja to fulfill Lord
Vamanadeva's request.
When Bali Maharaja, thinking Vamanadeva to be the son of a brahmana, told Him to ask for anything
He liked, Lord Vamanadeva praised Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa for their heroic activities, and after
thus praising the family in which Bali Maharaja had been born, He begged the King for three paces of
land. Bali Maharaja agreed to give this land in charity, since this was very insignificant, but Sukracarya,
who could understand that Vamanadeva was Visnu, the friend of the demigods, forbade Bali Maharaja to
give this land. Sukracarya advised Bali Maharaja to withdraw his promise. He explained that in subduing
others, in joking, in responding to danger, in acting for the welfare of others, and so on, one could refuse
to fulfill one's promise, and there would be no fault. By this philosophy, Sukracarya tried to dissuade Bali
Maharaja from giving land to Lord Vamanadeva.
