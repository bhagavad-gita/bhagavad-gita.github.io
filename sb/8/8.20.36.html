<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord assured Bali Maharaja of all protection, and finally the Lord assured him of protection from
the effects of bad association with the demons. Bali Maharaja certainly became an exalted devotee, but he
was somewhat anxious because his association was not purely devotional. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead therefore assured him that his demoniac mentality would be annihilated. In other words, by the
association of devotees, the demoniac mentality is vanquished.
satam prasangan mama virya-samvido
bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah
(Bhag. 3.25.25)
When a demon associates with devotees engaged in glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he
gradually becomes a pure devotee.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-second Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Bali Maharaja Surrenders His Life."
Chapter Twenty-three
The Demigods Regain the Heavenly Planets
This chapter describes how Bali Maharaja, along with his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja, entered the
planet Sutala and how the Supreme Personality of Godhead allowed Indra to reenter the heavenly planet.
The great soul Bali Maharaja experienced that the highest gain in life is to attain devotional service
under the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet in full surrender. Being fixed in this conclusion, his heart full of
ecstatic devotion and his eyes full of tears, he offered obeisances to the Personality of Godhead and then,
with his associates, entered the planet known as Sutala. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead
satisfied the desire of Aditi and reinstalled Lord Indra. Prahlada Maharaja, being aware of Bali's release
from arrest, then described the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this
material world. Prahlada Maharaja praised the Supreme Lord for creating the material world, for being
equal to everyone and for being extremely liberal to the devotees, just like a desire tree. Indeed, Prahlada
Maharaja said that the Lord is kind not only to His devotees but also to the demons. In this way he
described the unlimited causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, with folded hands,
he offered his respectful obeisances unto the Lord, and after circumambulating the Lord he also entered
the planet Sutala in accordance with the Lord's order. The Lord then ordered Sukracarya to describe Bali
Maharaja's faults and discrepancies in executing the sacrificial ceremony. Sukracarya became free from
fruitive actions by chanting the holy name of the Lord, and he explained how chanting can diminish all
the faults of the conditioned soul. He then completed Bali Maharaja's sacrificial ceremony. All the great
saintly persons accepted Lord Vamanadeva as the benefactor of Lord Indra because He had returned Indra
to his heavenly planet. They accepted the Supreme personality of Godhead as the maintainer of all the
affairs of the universe. Being very happy, Indra, along with his associates, placed Vamanadeva before him
and reentered the heavenly planet in their airplane. Having seen the wonderful activities of Lord Visnu in
the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaja, all the demigods, saintly persons, Pitas, Bhutas and Siddhas glorified
the Lord again and again. The chapter concludes by saying that the most auspicious function of the
conditioned soul is to chant and hear about the glorious activities of Lord Visnu.
