<h2>Text</h2>
daityan grhita-kalaso
vancayann upasancaraih
dura-sthan payayam asa
jara-mrtyu-haram sudham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
daityan--the demons; grhita-kalasah--the Lord, who bore the container of nectar; vancayan--by cheating;
upasancaraih--with sweet words; dura-sthan--the demigods, who were sitting at a distant place; payayam
asa--made them drink; jara-mrtyu-haram--which can counteract invalidity, old age and death; sudham--
such nectar.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Taking the container of nectar in Her hands, She first approached the demons, satisfied them with sweet
words and thus cheated them of their share of the nectar. Then She administered the nectar to the
demigods, who were sitting at a distant place, to make them free from invalidity, old age and death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Mohini-murti, the Personality of Godhead, gave the demigods seats at a distance. Then She approached
the demons and spoke with them very graciously, so that they thought themselves very fortunate to talk
with Her. Since Mohini-murti had seated the demigods at a distant place, the demons thought that the
demigods would get only a little of the nectar and that Mohini-murti was so pleased with the demons that
She would give the demons all the nectar. The words vancayann upasancaraih indicate that the Lord's
whole policy was to cheat the demons simply by speaking sweet words. The Lord's intention was to
distribute the nectar only to the demigods.
