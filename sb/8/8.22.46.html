<h2>Translation</h2>
The King said: By the grace of the Lord, those who have lost their self-knowledge since time
immemorial, and who because of this ignorance are involved in a material, conditional life full of miseries,
obtain the chance to meet the Lord's devotee. I accept that Supreme Personality of Godhead as the
supreme spiritual master.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the supreme spiritual master. The Supreme Lord knows
everything about the suffering of the conditioned soul, and therefore He appears in this material world,
sometimes personally, sometimes by an incarnation and sometimes by authorizing a living being to act on
His behalf. In all cases, however, He is the original spiritual master who enlightens the conditioned souls
who are suffering in the material world. The Lord is always busy helping the conditioned souls in many
ways. Therefore He is addressed here as paramo gurur bhavan. The representative of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead who acts to spread Krsna consciousness is also guided by the Supreme Lord to act
properly in executing the Lord's order. Such a person may appear to be an ordinary human being, but
because he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual master, he is not
to be neglected as ordinary. It is therefore said, acaryam mam vijaniyat: an acarya who acts on behalf of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be understood to be as good as the Supreme Lord Himself.
saksad dharitvena samasta-sastrair
uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih
kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has advised that the spiritual master acting on the Supreme Lord's behalf
must be worshiped as being as good as the Supreme Lord, for he is the Lord's most confidential servant in
broadcasting the Lord's message for the benefit of the conditioned souls involved in the material world.
