<h2>Text</h2>
esa te sthanam aisvaryam
sriyam tejo yasah srutam
dasyaty acchidya sakraya
maya-manavako harih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
esah--this person falsely appearing as a brahmacari; te--of you; sthanam--the land in possession;
aisvaryam--the riches; sriyam--the material beauty; tejah--the material power; yasah--the reputation;
srutam--the education; dasyati--will give; acchidya--taking from you; sakraya--unto your enemy, Lord
Indra; maya--falsely appearing; manavakah--a brahmacari son of a living being; harih--He is actually the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This person falsely appearing as a brahmacari is actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who
has come in this form to take away all your land, wealth, beauty, power, fame and education. After taking
everything from you, He will deliver it to Indra, your enemy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains in this regard that the very word harih means "one who
takes away." If one connects himself with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord takes away
all his miseries, and in the beginning the Lord also superficially appears to take away all his material
possessions, reputation, education and beauty. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.88.8), yasyaham
anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih. The Lord said to Maharaja Yudhisthira, "The first installment of
My mercy toward a devotee is that I take away all his possessions, especially his material opulence, his
money." This is the special favor of the Lord toward a sincere devotee. If a sincere devotee wants Krsna
above everything but at the same time is attached to material possessions, which hinder his advancement
in Krsna consciousness, by tactics the Lord takes away all his possessions. Here Sukracarya says that this
dwarf brahmacari would take away everything. Thus he indicates that the Lord will take away all one's
material possessions and also one's mind. If one delivers his mind to the lotus feet of Krsna (sa vai manah
krsna-padaravindayoh), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him. Although Bali Maharaja was
a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him,
showed him special favor by appearing as Lord Vamana to take away all his material possessions, and his
mind as well.
