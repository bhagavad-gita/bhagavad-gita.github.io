TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator,
maintainer and annihilator of this material world. In spite of acting in that way, He is never entangled.
Hence devotees who follow in His footsteps are also never entangled.
PURPORT
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: "work done
as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." If we do
not act in Krsna consciousness we shall be entangled, like silkworms in cocoons. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears in order to teach us how to work so that we will not be entangled
in this material world. Our real problem is that we are entangled in materialistic activities, and because we
are conditioned, our struggle continues through punishment in material existence in one body after
another in different forms of life. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):
mamaivamso jiva-loke
jiva-bhutah sanatanah
manah sasthanindriyani
prakrti-sthani karsati
"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life,
they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind." The living entities are actually
minute forms who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is full in everything, and
the small particles of the Lord are also originally qualified like Him, but because of their minute existence,
they are infected by material attraction and thus entangled. We must therefore follow the instructions of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then, like Krsna, who is never entangled by His material
activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, we will have nothing for which to lament
(navasidanti ye 'nu tam). Krsna personally gives instructions in Bhagavad-gita, and anyone who follows
these instructions is liberated.
Following Krsna's instructions is possible when one is a devotee, for Krsna instructs that one should
become a devotee. Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru: "Always think of Me and
become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me." (Bg. 18.65) Always thinking of Krsna
means chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, but unless one is an initiated devotee he cannot do this. As soon
as one becomes a devotee, he engages in Deity worship (mad-yaji). A devotee's business is to offer
obeisances to the Lord and the spiritual master constantly. This principle is the recognized way to come to
the platform of bhakti. As soon as one comes to this platform, he gradually understands the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and simply by understanding Krsna one is liberated from material bondage.
