atmavasyam idam visvam
yat kincij jagatyam jagat
tena tyaktena bhunjitha
ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam
SYNONYMS
atma--the Supersoul; avasyam--living everywhere; idam--this universe; visvam--all universes, all places;
yat--whatever; kincit--everything that exists; jagatyam--in this world, everywhere; jagat--everything,
animate and inanimate; tena--by Him; tyaktena--allotted; bhunjithah--you may enjoy; ma--do not;
grdhah--accept; kasya svit--of anyone else; dhanam--the property.
TRANSLATION
Within this universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature is present
everywhere, wherever there are animate or inanimate beings. Therefore, one should accept only that
which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.
PURPORT
Having described the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as transcendental, Svayambhuva
Manu, for the instruction of the sons and grandsons in his dynasty, is now describing all the property of
the universe as belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Manu's instructions are not only for his
own sons and grandsons, but for all of human society. The word "man"--or, in Sanskrit, manusya--has
been derived from the name Manu, for all the members of human society are descendants of the original
Manu. Manu is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (4.1), where the Lord says:
imam vivasvate yogam
proktavan aham avyayam
vivasvan manave praha
manur iksvakave 'bravit
"I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to
Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku." Svayambhuva Manu and
Vaivasvata Manu have similar duties. Vaivasvata Manu was born of the sun-god, Vivasvan, and his son
was Iksvaku, the King of the earth. Since Manu is understood to be the original father of humanity,
human society should follow his instructions.
Svayambhuva Manu instructs that whatever exists, not only in the spiritual world but even within this
material world, is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present everywhere as the
Superconsciousness. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (13.3), ksetra jnam. capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu
bharata: in every field--in other words, in every body--the Supreme Lord is existing as the Supersoul. The
individual soul is given a body in which to live and act according to the instructions of the Supreme
Person, and therefore the Supreme Person also exists within every body. We should not think that we are
independent; rather, we should understand that we are allotted a certain portion of the total property of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
This understanding will lead to perfect communism. Communists think in terms of their own nations,
but the spiritual communism instructed here is not only nationwide but universal. Nothing belongs to any
nation or any individual person; everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the
meaning of this verse. Atmavasyam idam visvam: whatever exists within this universe is the property of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The modern communistic theory, and also the idea of the United
Nations, can be reformed--indeed, rectified--by the understanding that everything belongs to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The Lord is not a creation of our intelligence; rather, He has created us.
Atmavasyam idam visvam. Isavasyam idam sarvam. This universal communism can solve all the problems
of the world.
One should learn from the Vedic literature that one's body is also not the property of the individual
soul, but is given to the individual soul according to his karma. Karmana daiva-netrena jantur
dehopapattaye. The 8,400,000 different bodily forms are machines given to the individual soul. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." The Lord, as the Supersoul,
sits in everyone's heart and observes the various desires of the individual soul. The Lord is so merciful
that He gives the living entity the opportunity to enjoy varieties of desires in suitable bodies, which are
nothing but machines (yantrarudhani mayaya). These machines are manufactured by the material
ingredients of the external energy, and thus the living entity enjoys or suffers according to his desires.
This opportunity is given by the Supersoul.
Everything belongs to the Supreme, and therefore one should not usurp another's property. We have a
tendency to manufacture many things. Especially nowadays, we are building skyscrapers and developing
other material facilities. We should know, however, that the ingredients of the skyscrapers and machines
cannot be manufactured by anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The whole world is nothing
but a combination of the five material elements (tejo-vari-mrdam yatha vinimayah). A skyscraper is a
transformation of earth, water and fire. Earth and water are combined and burnt into bricks by fire, and a
skyscraper is essentially a tall construction of bricks. Although the bricks may be manufactured by man,
the ingredients of the bricks are not. Of course, man, as a manufacturer, may accept a salary from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is stated here: tena tyaktena bhunjithah. One may construct a big
skyscraper, but neither the constructor, the merchant nor the worker can claim proprietorship.
Proprietorship belongs to the person who has spent for the building. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead has manufactured water, earth, air, fire and the sky, and one can use these and take a salary
(tena tyaktena bhunjithah). However, one cannot claim proprietorship. This is perfect communism. Our
tendency to construct great buildings should be used only for constructing large and valuable temples in
which to install the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then our desire for construction will be
fulfilled.
Since all property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything should be offered to the
Lord, and we should take only prasada (tena tyaktena bhunjithah). We should not fight among ourselves
to take more than we need. As Narada said to Maharaja Yudhisthira:
yavad bhriyeta jatharam
tavat svatvam hi dehinam
adhikam yo 'bhimanyeta
sa steno dandam arhati
"One may claim proprietorship to as much wealth as required to maintain body and soul together, but
one who desires proprietorship over more than that must be considered a thief, and he deserves to be
punished by the laws of nature." (Bhag. 7.14.8) Of course, we need to be maintained in eating, sleeping,
mating and defending (ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithuna), but since the Supreme Lord, the Personality of
Godhead, has provided these necessities of life for the birds and bees, why not for mankind? There is no
need for economic development; everything is provided. Therefore one should understand that everything
belongs to Krsna, and with this idea, one may take prasada. However, if one interferes with the allotments
of others, he is a thief. We should not accept more than what we actually need. Therefore, if by chance we
get an abundance of money, we should always consider that it belongs to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In Krsna consciousness we are getting sufficient money, but we should never think that the
money belongs to us; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be equally distributed
to the workers, the devotees. No devotee should claim that any money or property belongs to him. If one
thinks that any portion of property of this huge universe belongs to anyone, he is to be considered a thief
and is punishable by the laws of nature. Daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: no one can
surpass the vigilance of material nature or hide his intentions from material nature. If human society
unlawfully claims that the property of the universe, either partially or wholly, belongs to mankind, all of
human society will be cursed as a society of thieves and will be punished by the laws of nature.
