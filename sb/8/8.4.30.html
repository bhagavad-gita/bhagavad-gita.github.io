TRANSLATION
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: When the King of the elephants was describing the supreme
authority, without mentioning any particular person, he did not invoke the demigods, headed by Lord
Brahma, Lord Siva, Indra and Candra. Thus none of them approached him. However, because Lord Hari is
the Supersoul, Purusottama, the Personality of Godhead, He appeared before Gajendra.
PURPORT
From the description of Gajendra, he apparently was aiming at the supreme authority although he did
not know who the supreme authority is. He conjectured, "There is a supreme authority who is above
everything." Under the circumstances, the Lord's various expansions, such as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva,
Candra and Indra, all thought, "Gajendra is not asking our help. He is asking the help of the Supreme,
who is above all of us." As Gajendra has described, the Supreme Lord has various parts and parcels,
including the demigods, human beings and animals, all covered by separate forms. Although the
demigods are in charge of maintaining different aspects of the universe, Gajendra thought that they were
unable to rescue him. Harim vina naiva mrtim taranti: no one can rescue anyone from the dangers of
birth, death, old age and disease. It is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead who can rescue one from
the dangers of material existence. Therefore an intelligent person, to get free from this dangerous
existence, approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not any demigod. As confirmed in Bhagavadgita
(7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nya-devatah: those who are unintelligent approach
the various demigods for temporary material benefits. Actually, however, these demigods cannot rescue
the living entity from the dangers of material existence. Like other living entities, the demigods are merely
external parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead's transcendental body. As stated in the Vedic
mantras, sa atma-angany anya devatah. Within the body is the atma, the soul, whereas the various parts of
the body like the hands and legs are external. Similarly, the atma of the entire cosmic manifestation is
Narayana, Lord Visnu, and all the demigods, human beings and other living entities are parts of His body.
It may also be concluded that since a tree lives on the strength of its root and when the root is
nourished with water all the parts of the tree are nourished, one should worship the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the original root of everything. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very
difficult to approach, He is very near to us because He lives within our hearts. As soon as the Lord
understands that one is seeking His favor by fully surrendering, naturally He immediately takes action.
Therefore although the demigods did not come to the aid of Gajendra, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead immediately appeared before him because of his fervent prayer. This does not mean that the
demigods were angry with Gajendra, for actually when Lord Visnu is worshiped, all the other demigods
are also worshiped. Yasmin tuste jagat tustam: if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied,
everyone is satisfied.
yatha taror mula-nisecanena
trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah
pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam
tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya
"As pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches, twigs and everything else, and as
supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, so simply worshiping the
Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods, who are
parts of that Supreme Personality." (Bhag. 4.31.14) When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
worshiped, all the demigods are satisfied.
