<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Lord Siva observed the beautiful woman playing with the ball, She sometimes glanced at him and
slightly smiled in bashfulness. As he looked at the beautiful woman and She watched him, he forgot both
himself and Uma, his most beautiful wife, as well as his associates nearby.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material bondage of this world is that a beautiful woman can captivate a handsome man and that a
handsome man can captivate a beautiful woman. Such are the affairs that began when Lord Siva observed
the beautiful girl playing with the ball. In such activities, the influence of Cupid is very prominent. As
both parties move their eyebrows and glance at one another, their lusty desires increase more and more.
Such reciprocations of lusty desire took place between Lord Siva and the beautiful woman, even though
Uma and Lord Siva's associates were by Lord Siva's side. Such is the attraction between man and woman
in the material world. Lord Siva was supposed to be above all this attraction, but he was victimized by the
captivating power of Lord Visnu. Rsabhadeva thus explains the nature of lusty attraction:
pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam
tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh
ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair
janasya moho 'yam aham mameti
"The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this
misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body,
home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one increases life's illusions and thinks in
terms of 'I and mine.' " (Bhag. 5.5.8) When a man and woman exchange feelings of lust, both of them are
victimized, and thus they are bound to this material world in various ways.
