<h2>Text</h2>

dasyamy amusmai ksitim ipsitam mune
<p></p>

<h2>Translation</h2>
O great sage, great saintly persons like you, being completely aware of the Vedic principles for
performing ritualistic ceremonies and yajnas, worship Lord Visnu in all circumstances. Therefore,
whether that same Lord Visnu has come here to give me all benedictions or to punish me as an enemy, I
must carry out His order and give Him the requested tract of land without hesitation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Lord Siva:
aradhananam sarvesam
visnor aradhanam param
tasmat parataram devi
tadiyanam samarcanam
(Padma Purana)
Although in the Vedas there are recommendations for worshiping many demigods, Lord Visnu is the
Supreme Person, and worship of Visnu is the ultimate goal of life. The Vedic principles of the varnasrama
institution are meant to organize society to prepare everyone to worship Lord Visnu.
varnasramacaravata
purusena parah puman
visnur aradhyate pantha
nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed
duties in the system of varna and asrama. There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead." (Visnu Purana 3.8.9) One must ultimately worship Lord Visnu, and for that purpose the
varnasrama system organizes society into brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, brahmacaris, grhasthas,
vanaprasthas and sannyasis. Bali Maharaja, having been perfectly educated in devotional service by his
grandfather Prahlada Maharaja, knew how things are to be done. He was never to be misguided by
anyone, even by a person who happened to be his so-called spiritual master. This is the sign of full
surrender. Bhaktivinoda Thakura said:
marabi rakhabi----yo iccha tohara
nitya-dasa-prati tuya adhikara
When one surrenders to Lord Visnu, one must be prepared to abide by His orders in all circumstances,
whether He kills one or gives one protection. Lord Visnu must be worshiped in all circumstances.
