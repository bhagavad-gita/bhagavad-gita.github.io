sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; yada--when; yuddhe--in the fighting; asuraih--by the
demons; devah--the demigods; badhyamanah--besieged; sita-ayudhaih--by serpent weapons; gata-asavah--

TRANSLATION
Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the asuras, with their serpent weapons, severely attacked the demigods
in a fight, many of the demigods fell and lost their lives. Indeed, they could not be revived. At that time, O
King, the demigods had been cursed by Durvasa Muni, the three worlds were poverty-stricken, and
therefore ritualistic ceremonies could not be performed. The effects of this were very serious.
PURPORT
It is described that while Durvasa Muni was passing on the road, he saw Indra on the back of his
elephant and was pleased to offer Indra a garland from his own neck. Indra, however, being too puffed up,
took the garland, and without respect for Durvasa Muni, he placed it on the trunk of his carrier elephant.
The elephant, being an animal, could not understand the value of the garland, and thus the elephant
threw the garland between its legs and smashed it. Seeing this insulting behavior, Durvasa Muni
immediately cursed Indra to be poverty-stricken, bereft of all material opulence. Thus the demigods,
afflicted on one side by the fighting demons and on the other by the curse of Durvasa Muni, lost all the
material opulences in the three worlds.
To be extremely opulent in materialistic advancement is sometimes very risky. The materially opulent
person does not care about anyone, and thus he commits offenses to great personalities, such as devotees
and great saints. This is the way of material opulence. As described by Sukadeva Gosvami, dhanadurmadandha:
too much wealth makes one blind. This happens even to Indra in his heavenly kingdom,
and what to speak of others in this material world? When one is materially opulent, he should learn to be
sober and well-behaved toward Vaisnavas and saintly persons; otherwise he will fall down.

TRANSLATION
Lord Indra, Varuna and the other demigods, seeing their lives in such a state, consulted among
themselves, but they could not find any solution. Then all the demigods assembled and went together to
the peak of Sumeru Mountain. There, in the assembly of Lord Brahma, they fell down to offer Lord
Brahma their obeisances, and then they informed him of all the incidents that had taken place.

bhagavan--the most powerful; parah--of the demigods.
TRANSLATION
Upon seeing that the demigods were bereft of all influence and strength and that the three worlds were
consequently devoid of auspiciousness, and upon seeing that the demigods were in an awkward position
whereas all the demons were flourishing, Lord Brahma, who is above all the demigods and who is most
powerful, concentrated his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus being encouraged, he
became bright-faced and spoke to the demigods as follows.
PURPORT
After hearing from the demigods the real situation, Lord Brahma was very much concerned because the
demons were unnecessarily so powerful. When demons become powerful, the entire world is placed in an
awkward position because demons are simply interested in their own sense gratification and not in the
welfare of the world. Demigods or devotees, however, are concerned with the welfare of all living beings.
Srila Rupa Gosvami, for example, left his ministership and went to Vrndavana for the benefit of the entire
world (lokanam hita-karinau). This is the nature of a saintly person or demigod. Even impersonalists
think of the welfare of all people. Thus Brahma was very much concerned at seeing the demons in power.
