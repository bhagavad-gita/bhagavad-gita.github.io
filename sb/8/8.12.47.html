asat-avisayam--not understood by the atheists; anghrim--unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead; bhava-gamyam--understood by devotees; prapannan--fully surrendered; amrtam--the nectar;
amara-varyan--only unto the demigods; asayat--gave to drink; sindhu-mathyam--produced from the ocean
of milk; kapata-yuvati-vesah--appearing as a false young girl; mohayan--captivating; yah--He who; suraarin--
the enemies of the demigods; tam--unto Him; aham--I; upasrtanam--of the devotees; kama-puram--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Assuming the form of a young woman and thus bewildering the demons, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead distributed to His devotees, the demigods, the nectar produced from the churning of the ocean
of milk. Unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always fulfills the desires of His devotees, I offer
my respectful obeisances.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The instruction of this narration concerning the churning of the milk ocean is clearly manifested by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although He is equal to everyone, because of natural affection He favors
His devotees. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):
samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in
devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." This partiality of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is natural. A person cares for his children not because of partiality but in a reciprocation of love.
The children depend on the father's affection, and the father affectionately maintains the children.
Similarly, because devotees do not know anything but the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord is always
prepared to give protection to His devotees and fulfill their desires. He therefore says, kaunteya pratijanihi
na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Mohini-murti Incarnation Bewilders Lord Siva."
Chapter Thirteen

Bahu. The incarnation of this manvantara is known as Brhadbhanu. He is born of Satrayana from the
womb of Vitana.
The total duration of the periods ruled by these Manus is calculated to be one thousand catur-yugas, or
4,300,000 times 1,000 years.
