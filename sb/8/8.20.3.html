<h2>Text</h2>
sa caham vitta-lobhena
pratyacakse katham dvijam
pratisrutya dadamiti
prahradih kitavo yatha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--such a person as I am; ca--also; aham--I am; vitta-lobhena--for being allured by greed for money;
pratyacakse--I shall cheat or say no when I have already said yes; katham--how; dvijam--especially to a
brahmana; pratisrutya--after already having promised; dadami--that I shall give; iti--thus; prahradih--I
who am famous as the grandson of Maharaja Prahlada; kitavah--an ordinary cheater; yatha--just like.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I am the grandson of Maharaja Prahlada. How can I withdraw my promise because of greed for money
when I have already said that I shall give this land? How can I behave like an ordinary cheater, especially
toward a brahmana?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja had already been blessed by his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja. Therefore, he was a pure
devotee, although born in a family of demons. There are two kinds of highly elevated devotees, called
sadhana-siddha and krpa-siddha. Sadhana-siddha refers to one who has become a devotee by regular
execution of the regulative principles mentioned in the sastras, as ordered and directed by the spiritual
master. If one regularly executes such devotional service, he will certainly attain perfection in due course
of time. But there are other devotees, who may not have undergone all the required details of devotional
service but who, by the special mercy of guru and Krsna--the spiritual master and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead--have immediately attained the perfection of pure devotional service. Examples of
such devotees are the yajna-patnis, Maharaja Bali and Sukadeva Gosvami. The yajna-patnis were the wives
of ordinary brahmanas engaged in fruitive activities. Although the brahmanas were very learned and
advanced in Vedic knowledge, they could not achieve the mercy of Krsna-Balarama, whereas their wives
achieved complete perfection in devotional service, despite their being women. Similarly, Vairocani, Bali
Maharaja, received the mercy of Prahlada Maharaja, and by Prahlada Maharaja's mercy he also received
the mercy of Lord Visnu, who appeared before him as a brahmacari beggar. Thus Bali Maharaja became a
krpa-siddha because of the special mercy of both guru and Krsna. Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms this
favor: guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija (Cc. Madhya 19.151). Bali Maharaja, by the grace of
Prahlada Maharaja, got the seed of devotional service, and when that seed developed, he achieved the
ultimate fruit of that service, namely love of Godhead (prema pum-artho mahan), immediately upon the
appearance of Lord Vamanadeva. Bali Maharaja regularly maintained devotion for the Lord, and because
he was purified, the Lord appeared before him. Because of unalloyed love for the Lord, he then
immediately decided, "I shall give this little dwarf brahmana whatever He asks from me." This is a sign of
love. Thus Bali Maharaja is understood to be one who received the highest perfection of devotional service
by special mercy.
