TRANSLATION
In human society there are various activities performed for the protection of one's wealth and life by
one's words, one's mind and one's actions, but they are all performed for one's personal or extended sense
gratification with reference to the body. All these activities are baffled because of being separate from
devotional service. But when the same activities are performed for the satisfaction of the Lord, the
beneficial results are distributed to everyone, just as water poured on the root of a tree is distributed
throughout the entire tree.
PURPORT
This is the distinction between materialistic activities and activities performed in Krsna consciousness.
The entire world is active, and this includes the karmis, the jnanis, the yogis and the bhaktas. However,
all activities except those of the bhaktas, the devotees, end in bafflement and a waste of time and energy.
Moghasa mogha-karmano mogha jnana vicetasah: if one is not a devotee, his hopes, his activities and his
knowledge are all baffled. A nondevotee works for his personal sense gratification or for the sense
gratification of his family, society, community or nation, but because all such activities are separate from
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are considered asat. The word asat means bad or temporary,
and sat means permanent and good. Activities performed for the satisfaction of Krsna are permanent and
good, but asat activity, although sometimes celebrated as philanthropy, altruism, nationalism, this "ism"
or that "ism," will never produce any permanent result and is therefore all bad. Even a little work done in
Krsna consciousness is a permanent asset and is all-good because it is done for Krsna, the all-good
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is everyone's friend (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam). The Supreme
personality of Godhead is the only enjoyer and proprietor of everything (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarvaloka-
mahesvaram). Therefore any activity performed for the Supreme Lord is permanent. As a result of
such activities, the performer is immediately recognized. Na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priyakrttamah.
Such a devotee, because of full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
immediately transcendental, although he may superficially appear to be engaged in materialistic activities.
The only distinction between materialistic activity and spiritual activity is that material activity is
performed only to satisfy one's own senses whereas spiritual activity is meant to satisfy the transcendental
senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By spiritual activity everyone factually benefits, whereas by
materialistic activity no one benefits and instead one becomes entangled in the laws of karma.
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Lord Incarnates as Mohini-murti."
Chapter Ten
The Battle Between the Demigods and the Demons
The summary of Chapter Ten is as follows. Because of envy, the fight between the demons and the
demigods continued. When the demigods were almost defeated by demoniac maneuvers and became
morose, Lord Visnu appeared among them.
Both the demigods and the demons are expert in activities involving the material energy, but the
demigods are devotees of the Lord, whereas the demons are just the opposite. The demigods and demons
churned the ocean of milk to get nectar from it, but the demons, not being devotees of the Lord, could
derive no profit. After feeding nectar to the demigods, Lord Visnu returned to His abode on the back of
Garuda, but the demons, being most aggrieved, again declared war against the demigods. Bali Maharaja,
the son of Virocana, became the commander in chief of the demons. In the beginning of the battle, the
demigods prepared to defeat the demons. Indra, King of heaven, fought with Bali, and other demigods,
like Vayu, Agni and Varuna, fought against other leaders of the demons. In this fight the demons were
defeated, and to save themselves from death they began to manifest many illusions through material
maneuvers, killing many soldiers on the side of the demigods. The demigods, finding no other recourse,
surrendered again to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who then appeared and counteracted all
the illusions presented by the jugglery of the demons. Heroes among the demons such as Kalanemi, Mali,
Sumali and Malyavan fought the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were all killed by the Lord. The
demigods were thus freed from all dangers.
