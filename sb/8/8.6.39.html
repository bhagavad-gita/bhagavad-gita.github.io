all the birds; varah--the biggest or most powerful; yayau--went; jala-ante--where the water is; utsrjya--

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, Garuda, the chief of birds, unloaded Mandara Mountain from his shoulder and brought it
near the water. Then he was asked by the Lord to leave that place, and he left.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Garuda was asked by the Lord to leave that place because the snake Vasuki, who was to be used as the
rope for churning, could not go there in the presence of Garuda. Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, is not
a vegetarian. He eats big snakes. Vasuki, being a great snake, would be natural food for Garuda, the chief
of birds. Lord Visnu therefore asked Garuda to leave so that Vasuki could be brought to churn the ocean
with Mandara Mountain, which was to be used as the churning rod. These are the wonderful
arrangements of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing takes place by accident. Carrying Mandara
Mountain on the back of a bird and putting it in its right position might be difficult for anyone, whether
demigod or demon, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead everything is possible, as shown by this
pastime. The Lord had no difficulty lifting the mountain with one hand, and Garuda, His carrier, carried
all the demons and demigods together by the grace of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is known as Yogesvara,
the master of all mystic power, because of His omnipotence. If He likes, He can make anything lighter
than cotton or heavier than the universe. Those who do not believe in the activities of the Lord cannot
explain how things happen. Using words like "accident," they take shelter of ideas that are unbelievable.
Nothing is accidental. Everything is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Lord Himself
confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.10). Mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram. Whatever actions and
reactions occur within the cosmic manifestation all take place under the superintendence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. However, because the demons do not understand the potency of the Lord, when
wonderful things are done, the demons think that they are accidental.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Demigods and Demons Declare a Truce."
Chapter Seven
Lord Siva Saves the Universe by Drinking Poison
The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows. As described in this chapter, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry
Mandara Mountain on His back. At first the churning of the ocean produced kalakuta poison. Everyone
feared this poison, but Lord Siva satisfied them by drinking it.
With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it
equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vasuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod. By the
expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth,
whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake. Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the
snake in both directions. Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held
by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and
the demigods was vanquished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a
tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back. Then the churning resumed with great force. As a
result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced. The prajapatis, seeing no one else to save
them, approached Lord Siva and offered him prayers full of truth. Lord Siva is called Asutosa because he is
very pleased if one is a devotee. Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the
churning. The goddess Durga, Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Siva
agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Siva's prowess. Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this
agreement. Then Lord Siva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere. He took it in his hand
and drank it. After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish. A small quantity of the poison dropped
from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions,
toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.
