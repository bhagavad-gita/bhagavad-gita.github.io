<h2>Text</h2>
sreyah kurvanti bhutanam
sadhavo dustyajasubhih
dadhyan-sibi-prabhrtayah
ko vikalpo dharadisu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sreyah--activities of the utmost importance; kurvanti--execute; bhutanam--of the general mass of people;
sadhavah--the saintly persons; dustyaja--which are extremely hard to give up; asubhih--by their lives;
dadhyan--Maharaja Dadhici; sibi--Maharaja Sibi; prabhrtayah--and similar great personalities; kah--what;
vikalpah--consideration; dhara-adisu--in giving the land to the brahmana.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dadhici, Sibi and many other great personalities were willing to sacrifice even their lives for the benefit
of the people in general. This is the evidence of history. So why not give up this insignificant land? What
is the serious consideration against it?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja was prepared to give everything to Lord Visnu, and Sukracarya, being a professional
priest, might have been anxiously waiting, doubting whether there had been any such instance in history
in which one had given everything in charity. Bali Maharaja, however, cited the tangible examples of
Maharaja Sibi and Maharaja Dadhici, who had given up their lives for the benefit of the general public.
Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one's land, but land and other
possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (mrtyuh sarva-haras
caham). The Lord personally appeared to Bali Maharaja to take away everything he had, and thus he was
so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face. Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to
face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force. Under the
circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Visnu for His
satisfaction? Sri Canakya Pandita says in this regard, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati (Canakyasloka
36). Since our money and possessions do not last but will somehow or other be taken away, as long
as they are in our possession it is better to use them for charity to a noble cause. Therefore Bali Maharaja
defied the order of his so-called spiritual master.
