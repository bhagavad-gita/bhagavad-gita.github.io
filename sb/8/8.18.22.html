<h2>Translation</h2>
Bali Maharaja, along with all the priests, acaryas and members of the assembly, observed the Supreme
Personality of Godhead's universal body, which was full of six opulences. That body contained everything
within the universe, including all the gross material elements, the senses, the sense objects, the mind,
intelligence and false ego, the various kinds of living entities, and the actions and reactions of the three
modes of material nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says, aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam
pravartate: Krsna is the origin of everything. Vasudevah sarvam iti: Krsna is everything. Mat-sthani sarvabhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah: everything rests in the body of the Lord, yet the Lord is not
everywhere. Mayavadi philosophers think that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute
Truth, has become everything, He has no separate existence. Their philosophy is called advaita-vada.
Actually, however, their philosophy is not correct. Here, Bali Maharaja was the seer of the Personality of
Godhead's universal body, and that body was that which was seen. Thus there is dvaita-vada; there are
always two entities--the seer and the seen. The seer is a part of the whole, but he is not equal to the whole.
The part of the whole, the seer, is also one with the whole, but since he is but a part, he cannot be the
complete whole at any time. This acintya-bhedabheda--simultaneous oneness and difference--is the
perfect philosophy propounded by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
