<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, two very powerful demons named Mali and Sumali were killed by the Supreme Lord, who
severed their heads with His disc. Then Malyavan, another demon, attacked the Lord. With his sharp
club, the demon, who was roaring like a lion, attacked Garuda, the lord of the birds, who are born from
eggs. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original person, used His disc to cut off the head of
that enemy also.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Battle Between the Demigods and the Demons."
Chapter Eleven
King Indra Annihilates the Demons
As described in this chapter, the great saint Narada Muni, being very compassionate to the demons who
had been killed by the demigods, forbade the demigods to continue killing. Then Sukracarya, by his
mystic power, renewed the lives of all the demons.
Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons
again, with renewed energy. King Indra released his thunderbolt against Bali, and when Bali fell, his friend
Jambhasura attacked Indra, who then cut off Jambhasura's head with his thunderbolt. When Narada Muni
learned that Jambhasura had been killed, he informed Jambhasura's relatives Namuci, Bala and Paka, who
then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods. Indra, King of heaven, severed the heads of Bala
and Paka and released the weapon known as kulisa, the thunderbolt, against Namuci's shoulder. The
thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus Indra became morose. At that time, an unseen
voice came from the sky. The voice declared, "A dry or wet weapon cannot kill Namuci." Hearing this
voice, Indra began to think of how Namuci could be killed. He then thought of foam, which is neither
moist nor dry. Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill Namuci. Thus Indra and the other demigods
killed many demons. Then, at the request of Lord Brahma, Narada went to the demigods and forbade
them to kill the demons any longer. All the demigods then returned to their abodes. Following the
instructions of Narada, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took Bali Maharaja to Asta
Mountain. There, by the touch of Sukracarya's hand, Bali Maharaja regained his senses and consciousness,
and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the
mystic power of Sukracarya.
