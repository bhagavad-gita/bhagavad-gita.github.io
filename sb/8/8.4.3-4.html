<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--he who; asau--that; grahah--became a crocodile; sah--he; vai--indeed; sadyah--immediately;
parama--very nice; ascarya--wonderful; rupa-dhrk--possessing the form (of his original Gandharva

formerly Huhu; gandharva-sattamah--the best of Gandharvaloka; pranamya--offering his obeisances;
sirasa--by the head; adhisam--unto the supreme master; uttama-slokam--who is worshiped by the choicest
verses; avyayam--who is the supreme eternal; agayata--he began to chant; yasah-dhama--the glories of the
Lord; kirtanya-guna-sat-katham--whose transcendental pastimes and qualities are glorious.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The best of the Gandharvas, King Huhu, having been cursed by Devala Muni, had become a crocodile.
Now, having been delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he assumed a very beautiful form as
a Gandharva. Understanding by whose mercy this had happened, he immediately offered his respectful
obeisances with his head and began chanting prayers just suitable for the transcendental Lord, the
supreme eternal, who is worshiped by the choicest verses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The story of how the Gandharva had become a crocodile will be described later. The curse by which the
Gandharva took this position was actually a blessing, not a curse. One should not be displeased when a
saintly person curses someone, for his curse, indirectly, is a blessing. The Gandharva had the mentality of
an inhabitant of the celestial planetary system, and for him to become an associate of the Supreme Lord
would have taken millions of long years. However, because he was cursed by Devala Rsi, he became a
crocodile and in only one life was fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to
face and be promoted to the spiritual world to become one of the Lord's associates. Similarly, Gajendra
was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when he was freed from the curse of Agastya
Muni.
