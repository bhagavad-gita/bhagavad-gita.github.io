<h2>Text</h2>
girim caropya garude
hastenaikena lilaya
aruhya prayayav abdhim
surasura-ganair vrtah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
girim--the mountain; ca--also; aropya--placing; garude--on the back of Garuda; hastena--by the hand;
ekena--one; lilaya--very easily as His pastime; aruhya--getting on; prayayau--He went; abdhim--to the
ocean of milk; sura-asura-ganaih--by the demigods and asuras; vrtah--surrounded.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord very easily lifted the mountain with one hand and placed it on the back of Garuda. Then, He
too got on the back of Garuda and went to the ocean of milk, surrounded by the demigods and demons.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is proof of the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is above everyone. There
are two classes of living entities--the demons and the demigods--and the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is above them both. The demons believe in the "chance" theory of creation, whereas the demigods believe
in creation by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The omnipotence of the Supreme Lord is
proved here, for simply with one hand He lifted Mandara Mountain, the demigods and the demons,
placed them on the back of Garuda and brought them to the ocean of milk. Now, the demigods, the
devotees, would immediately accept this incident, knowing that the Lord can lift anything, however heavy
it might be. But although demons were also carried along with the demigods, demons, upon hearing of
this incident, would say that it is mythological. But if God is all-powerful, why would it be difficult for
Him to lift a mountain? Since He is floating innumerable planets with many hundreds and thousands of
Mandara Mountains, why can't He lift one of them with His hand? This is not mythology, but the
difference between the believers and the faithless is that the devotees accept the incidents mentioned in
the Vedic literatures to be true, whereas the demons simply argue and label all these historical incidents
mythology. Demons would prefer to explain that everything happening in the cosmic manifestation takes
place by chance, but demigods, or devotees, never consider anything to be chance. Rather, they know that
everything is an arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the difference between the
demigods and the demons.
