TRANSLATION
Since our bodies are made of sattva-guna, we, the demigods, are internally and externally situated in
goodness. All the great saints are also situated in that way. Therefore, if even we cannot understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, what is to be said of those who are most insignificant in their bodily
constitutions, being situated in the modes of passion and ignorance? How can they understand the Lord?
Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.
PURPORT
Atheists and demons cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is situated
within everyone. For them the Lord finally appears in the form of death, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(mrtyuh sarva-haras caham). Atheists think that they are independent, and therefore they do not care
about the supremacy of the Lord, yet the Lord asserts His supremacy when He overcomes them as death.
At the time of death, their attempts to use their so-called scientific knowledge and philosophical
speculation to deny the supremacy of the Lord cannot work. Hiranyakasipu, for example, was an exalted
representative of the atheistic class of men. He always challenged the existence of God, and thus he
became inimical even toward his own son. Everyone was afraid of Hiranyakasipu's atheistic principles.
Nonetheless, when Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared in order to kill him, Hiranyakasipu's atheistic principles
could not save him. Lord Nrsimhadeva killed Hiranyakasipu and took away all his power, influence and
pride. Atheistic men, however, never understand how everything they create is annihilated. The Supersoul
is situated within them, but because of the predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, they
cannot understand the supremacy of the Lord. Even the demigods, the devotees, who are transcendentally
situated or situated on the platform of goodness, are not fully aware of the qualities and position of the
Lord. How then can the demons and atheists understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead? It is not
possible. Therefore, to gain this understanding, the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, offered their
respectful obeisances to the Lord.
