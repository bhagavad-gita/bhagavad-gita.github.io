<h2>Text</h2>
brahmadayo loka-nathah
sva-nathaya samadrtah
sanuga balim ajahruh
sanksiptatma-vibhutaye
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahma-adayah--great personalities, headed by Lord Brahma; loka-nathah--the predominating deities of
various planets; sva-nathaya--unto their supreme master; samadrtah--with great respect; sa-anugah--with
their respective followers; balim--different paraphernalia of worship; ajahruh--collected; sanksipta-atmavibhutaye--
unto the Lord, who had expanded His personal opulence but had now reduced His size to the
Vamana form.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma and all the predominating deities of the various planetary systems began to worship Lord
Vamanadeva, their supreme master, who had reduced Himself from His all-pervading form to His original
form. They collected all the ingredients and paraphernalia for this worship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vamanadeva first expanded Himself to the universal form and then reduced Himself to the original
Vamana-rupa. Thus He acted exactly like Lord Krsna, who, at the request of Arjuna, first showed His
universal form and later resumed His original form as Krsna. The Lord can assume any form He likes, but
His original form is that of Krsna (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). According to the capacity of the devotee,
the Lord assumes various forms so that the devotee can handle Him. This is His causeless mercy. When
Lord Vamanadeva resumed His original form, Lord Brahma and his associates collected various
paraphernalia for worship with which to please Him.
