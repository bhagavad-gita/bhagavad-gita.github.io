<h2>Text</h2>
cakrena ksura-dharena
jahara pibatah sirah
haris tasya kabandhas tu
sudhayaplavito 'patat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
cakrena--by the disc; ksura-dharena--which was sharp like a razor; jahara--cut off; pibatah--while
drinking nectar; sirah--the head; harih--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tasya--of that Rahu;
kabandhah tu--but the headless body; sudhaya--by the nectar; aplavitah--without being touched; apatat--
immediately fell dead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, using His disc, which was sharp like a razor, at once cut off
Rahu's head. When Rahu's head was severed from his body, the body, being untouched by the nectar,
could not survive.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Personality of Godhead, Mohini-murti, severed Rahu's head from his body, the head
remained alive although the body died. Rahu had been drinking nectar through his mouth, and before the
nectar entered his body, his head was cut off. Thus Rahu's head remained alive whereas the body died.
This wonderful act performed by the Lord was meant to show that nectar is miraculous ambrosia.
