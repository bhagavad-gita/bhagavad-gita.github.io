mama--my; iritam--promised; vacah--words; vyalikam--false; sura-varya--O greatest of all suras

TRANSLATION
Bali Maharaja said: O best Personality of Godhead, most worshipable for all the demigods, if You think
that my promise has become false, I shall certainly rectify matters to make it truthful. I cannot allow my
promise to be false. Please, therefore, place Your third lotus footstep on my head.
PURPORT
Bali Maharaja could understand the pretense of Lord Vamanadeva, who had taken the side of the
demigods and come before him as a beggar. Although the Lord's purpose was to cheat him, Bali Maharaja
took pleasure in understanding how the Lord will cheat His devotee to glorify the devotee's position. It is
said that God is good, and this is a fact. Whether He cheats or rewards, He is always good. Bali Maharaja
therefore addressed Him as Uttamasloka. "Your Lordship," he said, "You are always praised with the best
of selected verses. On behalf of the demigods, You disguised Yourself to cheat me, saying that You wanted
only three paces of land, but later You expanded Your body to such an extent that with two footsteps You
covered the entire universe. Because You were working on behalf of Your devotees, You do not regard this
as cheating. Never mind. I cannot be considered a devotee. Nonetheless, because although You are the
husband of the goddess of fortune You have come to me to beg, I must satisfy You to the best of my
ability. So please do not think that I wanted to cheat You; I must fulfill my promise. I still have my body.
When I place my body for Your satisfaction, please put Your third step on my head." Since the Lord had
covered the entire universe with two steps, one might ask how Bali Maharaja's head could be sufficient for
His third step? Bali Maharaja, however, thought that the possessor of wealth must be greater than the
possession. Therefore although the Lord had taken all his possessions, the head of Bali Maharaja, the
possessor, would provide adequate place for the Lord's third step.
