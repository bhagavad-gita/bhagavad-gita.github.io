<h2>Text</h2>
slathad dukulam kabarim ca vicyutam

vimohayantim jagad-atma-mayaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
slathat--slipping or slackening; dukulam--the sari; kabarim ca--and the hair on the head; vicyutam--
being slackened and scattered; sannahyatim--trying to bind; vama-karena--with the left hand; valguna--
very beautifully attractive; vinighnatim--striking; anya-karena--with the right hand; kandukam--the ball;
vimohayantim--in this way captivating everyone; jagat--the whole world; atma-mayaya--by the spiritual
potency, the internal energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As She played with the ball, the sari covering Her body became loose, and Her hair scattered. She tried
to bind Her hair with Her beautiful left hand, and at the same time She played with the ball by striking it
with Her right hand. This was so attractive that the Supreme Lord, by His internal potency, in this way
captivated everyone.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (7.14) it is said, daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: the external potency of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely strong. Indeed, everyone is fully captivated by her
activities. Lord Sambhu (Siva) was not to be captivated by the external potency, but because Lord Visnu
wanted to captivate Him also, He exhibited His internal potency to act the way that His external potency
acts to captivate ordinary living entities. Lord Visnu can captivate anyone, even such a strong personality
as Lord Sambhu.
