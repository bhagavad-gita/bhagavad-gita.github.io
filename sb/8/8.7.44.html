saintly persons; prayasah--almost always; janah--such persons; parama-aradhanam--the topmost method

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of
people in general. This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is present in everyone's heart.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly
recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.68-69), ya idam
paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati. .. na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah:
"One who preaches the message of Bhagavad-gita to My devotees is most dear to Me. No one can excel
him in satisfying Me by worship." There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but
the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Krsna consciousness. Other welfare activities cannot be
effective, for the laws of nature and the results of karma cannot be checked. It is by destiny, or the laws of
karma, that one must suffer or enjoy. For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it,
whether it brings suffering or profit. Similarly, everyone is under obligations to karma and it reactions. No
one can change this. Therefore the sastra says:
tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido
na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah
(Bhag. 1.5.18)
One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a
result of the reactions of karma. What is that? One should endeavor to become Krsna conscious. If one
tries to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best
welfare activity. The Lord is automatically very pleased with him. If the Lord is pleased with him, what is
left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for
anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham). Again, as stated here, tapyante
loka-tapena sadhavah prayaso janah. The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Krsna
consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Krsna consciousness. The Lord
Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity.
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the
miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after
millennium." (Bg. 4.7-8) All the sastras conclude, therefore, that spreading the Krsna consciousness
movement is the best welfare activity in the world. Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon
people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee.
