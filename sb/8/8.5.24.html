<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
ity abhasya suran vedhah
saha devair arindama
ajitasya padam saksaj
jagama tamasah param
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; iti--thus; abhasya--talking; suran--unto the demigods;
vedhah--Lord Brahma, who is the head of this universe and who gives everyone good sense in Vedic
knowledge; saha--with; devaih--the demigods; arim-dama--O Maharaja Pariksit, subduer of all kinds of
enemies (such as the senses); ajitasya--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; padam--to the place;
saksat--directly; jagama--went; tamasah--the world of darkness; param--transcendental to, beyond.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, subduer of all enemies, after Lord Brahma finished speaking to the demigods, he
took them with him to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is beyond this material
world. The Lord's abode is on an island called Svetadvipa, which is situated in the ocean of milk.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit is addressed here as arindama, "subduer of all enemies." Not only do we have enemies
outside of our bodies, but within our bodies there are many enemies, such as lusty desires, anger and
greed. Maharaja Pariksit is specifically addressed as arindama because in his political life he was able to
subdue all kinds of enemies, and even though he was a young king, as soon as he heard that he was going
to die within seven days, he immediately left his kingdom. He did not follow the dictates of enemies
within his body, such as lust, greed and anger. He was not at all angry with the muni's son who had
cursed him. Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of Sukadeva
Gosvami. Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit, while
fully alive, wanted to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam. He is consequently addressed here as arindama.
Another word, sura-priya, is also significant. Although Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward His devotees (ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te
tesu capy aham). The devotees are all demigods. There are two kinds of men within this world. One is
called the deva, and the other is called the asura. The Padma Purana states:
dvau bhuta-sargau loke 'smin
daiva asura eva ca
visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva
asuras tad-viparyayah
Anyone who is a devotee of Lord Krsna is called a deva, and others, even though they may be devotees
of demigods, are called asuras. Ravana, for example, was a great devotee of Lord Siva, but he is described
as an asura. Similarly, Hiranyakasipu is described as a great devotee of Lord Brahma, yet he was also an
asura. Therefore, only the devotee of Lord Visnu is called sura, not asura. Lord Krsna is very much
pleased with His devotees, even if they are not on the topmost stage of devotional service. Even on the
lower stages of devotional service one is transcendental, and if one continues with devotional life, he
continues to be a deva or sura. If one continues in this way, Krsna will always be pleased with him and
will give him all instructions so that he may very easily return home, back to Godhead.
Concerning ajitasya padam, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the milk ocean of this
material world, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says: padam ksirodadhi-stha-svetadvipam tamasah
prakrteh param. The island known as Svetadvipa, which is in the ocean of milk, is transcendental. It has
nothing to do with this material world. A city government may have a rest house where the governor and
important government officers stay. Such a rest house is not an ordinary house. Similarly, although
Svetadvipa, which is in the ocean of milk, is in this material world, it is param padam, transcendental.
