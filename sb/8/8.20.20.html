<h2>Translation</h2>
Srimati Vindhyavali said: O my Lord, You have created the entire universe for the enjoyment of Your
personal pastimes, but foolish, unintelligent men have claimed proprietorship for material enjoyment.
Certainly they are shameless agnostics. Falsely claiming proprietorship, they think they can give charity
and enjoy. In such a condition, what good can they do for You, who are the independent creator,
maintainer and annihilator of this universe?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja's wife, who was most intelligent, supported the arrest of her husband and accused him of
having no intelligence because he had claimed proprietorship of the property of the Lord. Such a claim is
a sign of demoniac life. Although the demigods, who are officials appointed by the Lord for management,
are attached to materialistic enjoyment, they never claim to be proprietors of the universe, for they know
that the actual proprietor of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the qualification of
the demigods. But the demons, instead of accepting the exclusive proprietorship of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, claim the property of the universe for themselves through demarcations of
nationalism. "This part is mine, and that part is yours," they say. "This part I can give in charity, and this
part I can keep for my enjoyment." These are all demoniac conceptions. This is described in Bhagavadgita
(16.13): idam adya maya labdham imam prapsye manoratham. "Thus far I have acquired so much
money and land. Now I have to add more and more. In this way I shall be the greatest proprietor of
everything. Who can compete with me?" These are all demoniac conceptions.
Bali Maharaja's wife accused Bali Maharaja by saying that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead
had arrested him, showing him extraordinary mercy, and although Bali Maharaja was offering his body to
the Supreme Lord for the Lord's third step, he was still in the darkness of ignorance. Actually the body did
not belong to him, but because of his long-standing demoniac mentality he could not understand this. He
thought that since he had been defamed for his inability to fulfill his promise of charity, and since the
body belonged to him, he would free himself from defamation by offering his body. Actually, however, the
body does not belong to anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom the body is given. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
The Lord is situated in the core of everyone's heart, and, according to the material desires of the living
entity, the Lord offers a particular type of machine--the body--through the agency of the material energy.
The body actually does not belong to the living entity; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Under the circumstances, how could Bali Maharaja claim that the body belonged to him?
Thus Vindhyavali, Bali Maharaja's intelligent wife, prayed that her husband be released, by the Lord's
causeless mercy. Otherwise, Bali Maharaja was nothing but a shameless demon, specifically described as
tyakta-hriyas tvad-avaropita-kartr-vadah, a foolish person claiming proprietorship over the property of the
Supreme Person. In the present age, Kali-yuga, the number of such shameless men, who are agnostics
disbelieving in the existence of God, has increased. Trying to defy the authority of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, so-called scientists, philosophers and politicians manufacture plans and schemes
for the destruction of the world. They cannot do anything good for the world, and unfortunately, because
of Kali-yuga, they have plunged the affairs of the world into mismanagement. Thus there is a great need
for the Krsna consciousness movement for the benefit of innocent people who are being carried away by
propaganda of such demons. If the present status quo is allowed to continue, people will certainly suffer
more and more under the leadership of these demoniac agnostics.
