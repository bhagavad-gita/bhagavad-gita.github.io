<h2>Translation</h2>
Although bereft of his riches, fallen from his original position, defeated and arrested by his enemies,
rebuked and deserted by his relatives and friends, although suffering the pain of being bound and
although rebuked and cursed by his spiritual master, Bali Maharaja, being fixed in his vow, did not give
up his truthfulness. It was certainly with pretension that I spoke about religious principles, but he did not
give up religious principles, for he is true to his word.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja passed the severe test put before him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is
further proof of the Lord's mercy toward His devotee. The Supreme Personality of Godhead sometimes
puts a devotee to severe tests that are almost unbearable. One could hardly even live under the conditions
forced upon Bali Maharaja. That Bali Maharaja endured all these severe tests and austerities is the mercy
of the Supreme Lord. The Lord certainly appreciates the devotee's forbearance, and it is recorded for the
future glorification of the devotee. This was not an ordinary test. As described in this verse, hardly anyone
could survive such a test, but for the future glorification of Bali Maharaja, one of the mahajanas, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead not only tested him but also gave him the strength to tolerate such
adversity. The Lord is so kind to His devotee that when severely testing him the Lord gives him the
necessary strength to be tolerant and continue to remain a glorious devotee.
