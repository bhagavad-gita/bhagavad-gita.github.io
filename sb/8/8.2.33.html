whose force is fearful; abhidhavatah--who is chasing; bhrsam--endlessly (every hour and every

<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly not known to everyone, but He is very powerful and
influential. Therefore, although the serpent of eternal time, which is fearful in force, endlessly chases
everyone, ready to swallow him, if one who fears this serpent seeks shelter of the Lord, the Lord gives him
protection, for even death runs away in fear of the Lord. I therefore surrender unto Him, the great and
powerful supreme authority who is the actual shelter of everyone.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One who is intelligent understands that there is a great and supreme authority above everything. That
great authority appears in different incarnations to save the innocent from disturbances. As confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (4. 8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in His various
incarnations for two purposes--to annihilate the duskrti, the sinful, and to protect His devotees. The King
of the elephants decided to surrender unto Him. This is intelligent. One must know that great Supreme
Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. The Lord comes personally to instruct us how to be
happy, and only fools and rascals do not see by intelligence this supreme authority, the Supreme Person.
In the sruti-mantra it is said:
bhisasmad vatah pavate
bhisodeti suryah
bhisasmad agnis candras ca
mrtyur dhavati pancamah
(Taittiriya Upanisad 2.8)
It is out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the wind is blowing, that the sun is
distributing heat and light, and that death is chasing everyone. Thus there is a supreme controller, as
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram. This material
manifestation is working so well because of the supreme controller. Any intelligent person, therefore, can
understand that there is a supreme controller. Furthermore, the supreme controller Himself appears as
Lord Krsna, as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and as Lord Ramacandra to give us instructions and to show
us by example how to surrender unto the Supreme personality of Godhead. Yet those who are duskrti, the
lowest of men, do not surrender (na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah).
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord clearly says, mrtyuh sarva-haras caham: "I am all-devouring death." Thus
mrtyu, or death, is the representative who takes everything away from the living entity who has accepted a
material body. No one can say, "I do not fear death." This is a false proposition. Everyone fears death.
However, one who seeks shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be saved from death. One
may argue, "Does the devotee not die?" The answer is that a devotee certainly must give up his body, for
the body is material. The difference is, however, that for one who surrenders to Krsna fully and who is
protected by Krsna, the present body is his last; he will not again receive a material body to be subjected
to death. This is assured in Bhagavad-gita (4.9). Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so'rjuna: a
devotee, after giving up his body, does not accept a material body, but returns home, back to Godhead.
We are always in danger because at any moment death can take place. It is not that only Gajendra, the
King of the elephants, was afraid of death. Everyone should fear death because everyone is caught by the
crocodile of eternal time and may die at any moment. The best course, therefore, is to seek shelter of
Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and be saved from the struggle for existence in this material
world, in which one repeatedly takes birth and dies. To reach this understanding is the ultimate goal of
life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Elephant Gajendra's Crisis."
Chapter Three
Gajendra's Prayers of Surrender
In this chapter, the prayers by Gajendra, the King of the elephants, are described. It appears that the
King of the elephants was formerly a human being known as Indradyumna and that he learned a prayer to
the Supreme Lord. Fortunately he remembered that prayer and began to chant it to himself. First he
offered his respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his awkward
position in having been attacked by the crocodile, he expressed his inability to recite prayers nicely.
Nonetheless, he tried to chant the mantra and expressed himself in appropriate words as follows.
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, the original person from whom
everything has emanated. He is the root cause of this cosmic manifestation, and the entire cosmos rests in
Him, yet He is transcendental, for He does everything in relation to the material world through His
external energy. He is eternally situated in the spiritual world--in Vaikuntha or Goloka Vrndavana--where
He engages in His eternal pastimes. The material world is a product of His external energy, or material
nature, which works under His direction. It is thus that creation, maintenance and annihilation take
place. The Lord exists at all times. This is extremely difficult for a nondevotee to understand. Although
the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perceivable by everyone, only the pure devotees
perceive His presence and activities. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely free from material
birth, death, old age and disease. Indeed, if anyone in this material world takes shelter of Him, he also
becomes situated in that transcendental position. For the satisfaction of the devotee (paritranaya
sadhunam), the Lord appears and exhibits His activities. His appearance, disappearance and other
pastimes are not at all material. One who knows this secret can enter the kingdom of God. In the Lord, all
opposing elements are adjusted. The Lord is situated in everyone's heart. He is the controller of
everything, He is the witness of all activities, and He is the original source of all living entities. Indeed, all
living entities are parts of Him, for He is the origin of Maha-Visnu, who is the source of the living entities
within this material world. The Lord can observe the activities of our senses, which can work and achieve
material results because of His mercy. Although He is the original source of everything, He is untouched
by any of His by-products. In this way He is like a gold mine, which is the source of gold in ornaments
and yet is different from the ornaments themselves. The Lord is worshiped by the method prescribed in
the Pancaratras. He is the source of our knowledge, and He can give us liberation. Therefore it is our duty
to understand Him according to the instructions of devotees, in particular the spiritual master. Although
for us the mode of goodness is covered, by following the instructions of saintly persons and the spiritual
master we can be freed from material clutches.
"The self-effulgent material form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is adored by nondevotees, His
impersonal form is adored by those advanced in spiritual knowledge, and His feature as the localized
Supersoul is appreciated by yogis. But His original form as a person is understood only by devotees. That
Supreme Personality of Godhead is competent to dissipate the darkness of the conditioned soul through
His instructions in Bhagavad-gita. He is the ocean of transcendental qualities and can be understood only
by liberated persons freed from the bodily concept of life. By His causeless mercy, the Lord can rescue the
conditioned soul from the material clutches and enable him to return home, back to Godhead, to become
His personal associate. Nonetheless, a pure devotee does not aspire to go back to Godhead; he is simply
satisfied with executing his service in this material world. A pure devotee does not ask anything from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. His only prayer is to be freed from the material conception of life and to
be engaged in the Lord's transcendental loving service."
In this way the King of the elephants, Gajendra, offered prayers directly to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, without mistaking Him for one of the demigods. None of the demigods came to see him, not
even Brahma or Siva. Rather, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, seated on Garuda,
personally appeared before him. Gajendra, by lifting his trunk, offered obeisances to the Lord, and the
Lord immediately pulled him from the water along with the crocodile who had captured his leg. Then the
Lord killed the crocodile and thus rescued Gajendra.
