<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bubhuje--enjoyed; ca--also; sriyam--opulence; su-rddham--prosperity; dvija--of the brahmanas; deva--as
good as the demigods; upalambhitam--achieved because of the favor; krta-krtyam--very satisfied by his
activities; iva--like that; atmanam--himself; manyamanah--thinking; maha-manah--the great-minded.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of the favor of the brahmanas, the great soul Bali Maharaja, thinking himself very satisfied,
became very opulent and prosperous and began to enjoy the kingdom.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The brahmanas are called dvija-deva, and ksatriyas are generally called nara-deva. The word deva
actually refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The brahmanas guide human society in becoming
happy by satisfying Lord Visnu, and according to their advice, the ksatriyas, who are called nara-deva,
keep law and order so that other people, namely the vaisyas and sudras, may properly follow regulative
principles. In this way, people are gradually elevated to Krsna consciousness.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Bali Maharaja Conquers the Heavenly Planets."
Chapter Sixteen
Executing the Payo-vrata Process of Worship
As described in this chapter, because Aditi, the mother of the demigods, was very afflicted, her husband,
Kasyapa Muni, told her how to observe vows in austerities for the benefit of her sons.
Since the demigods were not visible in the heavenly kingdom, their mother, Aditi, because of separation
from them, was very much aggrieved. One day after many, many years, the great sage Kasyapa emerged
from a trance of meditation and returned to his asrama. He saw that the asrama was no longer beautiful
and that his wife was very morose. Everywhere in the asrama, he saw signs of lamentation. The great sage
therefore inquired from his wife about the well-being of the asrama and asked her why she looked so
morose. After Aditi informed Kasyapa Muni about the asrama's well-being, she told him that she was
lamenting for the absence of her sons. She then requested him to tell her how her sons could return and
reoccupy their positions. She wanted all good fortune for her sons. Moved by Aditi's request, Kasyapa
Muni instructed her in the philosophy of self-realization, the difference between matter and spirit, and
how to be unaffected by material loss. But when he saw that Aditi was not satisfied even after he had given
these instructions, he advised her to worship Vasudeva, Janardana. He assured her that only Lord
Vasudeva could satisfy her and fulfill all her desires. When Aditi then expressed her desire to worship
Lord Vasudeva, Prajapati Kasyapa told her about a process of worship known as payo-vrata, which is
executed in twelve days. Lord Brahma had instructed him how to satisfy Lord Krsna by this process, and
thus he advised his wife to observe this vow and its regulative principles.
