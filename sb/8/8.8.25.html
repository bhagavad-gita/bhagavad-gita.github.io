<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of the three worlds, and His bosom is the residence of
mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, the proprietor of all opulences. The goddess of fortune, by her
favorable and merciful glance, can increase the opulence of the three worlds, along with their inhabitants
and their directors, the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the desire of Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
made His bosom her residence so that by her glance she could favor everyone, including the demigods
and ordinary human beings. In other words, since the goddess of fortune stays on the bosom of Narayana,
she naturally sees any devotee who worships Narayana. When the goddess of fortune understands that a
devotee is in favor of devotional service to Narayana, she is naturally inclined to bless the devotee with all
opulences. The karmis try to receive the favor and mercy of Laksmi, but because they are not devotees of
Narayana, their opulence is flickering. The opulence of devotees who are attached to the service of
Narayana is not like the opulence of karmis. The opulence of devotees is as permanent as the opulence of
Narayana Himself.
