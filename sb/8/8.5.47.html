<h2>Text</h2>
klesa-bhury-alpa-sarani
karmani viphalani va
dehinam visayartanam
na tathaivarpitam tvayi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
klesa--hardship; bhuri--very much; alpa--very little; sarani--good result; karmani--activities; viphalani--
frustration; va--either; dehinam--of persons; visaya-artanam--who are eager to enjoy the material world;
na--not; tatha--like that; eva--indeed; arpitam--dedicated; tvayi--unto Your Lordship.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Karmis are always anxious to accumulate wealth for their sense gratification, but for that purpose they
must work very hard. Yet even though they work hard, the results are not satisfying. Indeed, sometimes
their work results only in frustration. But devotees who have dedicated their lives to the service of the
Lord can achieve substantial results without working very hard. These results exceed the devotee's
expectations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We can practically see how the devotees who have dedicated their lives for the service of the Lord in the
Krsna consciousness movement are getting immense opportunities for the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead without working very hard. The Krsna consciousness movement actually started
with only forty rupees, but now it has more than forty crores worth of property, and all this opulence has
been achieved within eight or ten years. No karmi can expect to improve his business so swiftly, and
besides that, whatever a karmi acquires is temporary and sometimes frustrating. In Krsna consciousness,
however, everything is encouraging and improving. The Krsna consciousness movement is not very
popular with the karmis because this movement recommends that one refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating,
gambling and intoxication. These are restrictions that karmis very much dislike. Nonetheless, in the
presence of so many enemies, this movement is progressing, going forward without impediments. If the
devotees continue to spread this movement, dedicating life and soul to the lotus feet of Krsna, no one will
be able to check it. The movement will go forward without limits. Chant Hare Krsna!
