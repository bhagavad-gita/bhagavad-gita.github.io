<h2>Text</h2>
sulabha yudhi viprarse
hy anivrttas tanu-tyajah
na tatha tirtha ayate
sraddhaya ye dhana-tyajah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
su-labhah--very easily obtained; yudhi--in the battlefield; vipra-rse--O best of the brahmanas; hi--indeed;
anivrttah--not being afraid of fighting; tanu-tyajah--and thus lay down their lives; na--not; tatha--as; tirthe
ayate--on the arrival of a saintly person who creates holy places; sraddhaya--with faith and devotion; ye--
those who; dhana-tyajah--can give up their accumulated wealth.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O best of the brahmanas, many men have laid down their lives on the battlefield, being unafraid of
fighting, but rarely has one gotten the chance to give his accumulated wealth faithfully to a saintly person
who creates holy places.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Many ksatriyas have laid down their lives on the battlefield for their nations, but hardly a person can be
found who has given up all his property and his accumulated wealth in charity to a person worthy of the
gift. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (17.20):
datavyam iti yad danam
diyate 'nupakarine
dese kale ca patre ca
tad danam sattvikam smrtam
"That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy person, and without
expectation of return is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness." Thus charity given in the
proper place is called sattvika. And above this charity in goodness is transcendental charity, in which
everything is sacrificed for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vamanadeva, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, had come to Bali Maharaja for alms. How could one get such an opportunity to
give charity? Therefore, Bali Maharaja decided without hesitation to give the Lord whatever He wanted.
One may get various opportunities to lay down his life on the battlefield, but such an opportunity as this
is hardly ever obtained.
