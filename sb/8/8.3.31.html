<h2>Text</h2>
tam tadvad artam upalabhya jagan-nivasah
stotram nisamya divijaih saha samstuvadbhih
chandomayena garudena samuhyamanas
cakrayudho 'bhyagamad asu yato gajendrah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--unto him (Gajendra); tadvat--in that way; artam--who was very depressed (because of being
attacked by the crocodile); upalabhya--understanding; jagat-nivasah--the Lord, who exists everywhere;
stotram--the prayer; nisamya--hearing; divijaih--the denizens of the heavenly planets; saha--with;
samstuvadbhih--who were offering their prayers also; chandomayena--with the speed He desired;
garudena--by Garuda; samuhyamanah--being carried; cakra--carrying His disc; ayudhah--and other
weapons, like the club; abhyagamat--arrived; asu--immediately; yatah--where; gajendrah--the King of the
elephants, Gajendra, was situated.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After understanding the awkward condition of Gajendra, who had offered his prayers, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, who lives everywhere, appeared with the demigods, who were offering
prayers to Him. Carrying His disc and other weapons, He appeared there on the back of His carrier,
Garuda, with great speed, according to His desire. Thus He appeared before Gajendra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura specifically hints that since Gajendra was in such a difficult
position and was praying for the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods, who could
have immediately gone to his rescue, hesitated to go there. Since they considered Gajendra's prayer to be
directed toward the Lord, they felt offended, and this in itself was offensive. Consequently, when the Lord
went there, they also went and offered prayers to the Lord so that their offense might be excused.
