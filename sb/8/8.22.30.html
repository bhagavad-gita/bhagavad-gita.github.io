<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, possessing eyes like the petals of a lotus, the worship of the demigods, who are in the bodily
concept of life, is fruitless in all respects. But because You are the supreme friend and dearmost Supersoul
of everyone, worship of Your lotus feet is never useless. You have therefore manifested Your form as a
fish.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demigods like Indra, Candra and Surya are ordinary living entities who are differentiated parts and
parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord expands Himself through the living beings
(nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam). His personal visnu-tattva forms, which are all spiritual, are called
svamsa, and the living entities who are differentiated parts are called vibhinnamsa. Some of the
vibhinnamsa forms are spiritual, and some are a combination of matter and spirit. The conditioned souls
in the material world are different from their external bodies made of material energy. Thus the demigods
living in the upper planetary systems and the living entities living in the lower planetary system are of the
same nature. Nonetheless, those living as human beings on this planet are sometimes attracted to
worshiping the demigods in the higher planetary systems. Such worship is temporary. As the human
beings on this planet have to change their bodies (tatha dehantara-praptih), the living entities known as
Indra, Candra, Varuna and so on will also have to change their bodies in due course of time. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: "Men of small intelligence worship
the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary." Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante 'nyadevatah:
those who do not know the position of the demigods are inclined to worship the demigods for
some material purpose, but the results of such worship are never permanent. Consequently, here it is said,
yathetaresam prthag-atmanam satam, padopasarpanam mrsa bhavet. In other words, if one is to worship
someone else, he must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then his worship will never be
fruitless. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even a slight attempt to worship the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is a permanent asset. Therefore, as recommended in Srimad-Bhagavatam,
tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam hareh. One should take to the worship of the lotus feet of Hari, even
if this means giving up the so-called occupational duty assigned because of the particular body one has
accepted. Because worship in terms of the body is temporary, it does not bear any permanent fruit. But
worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives immense benefit.
