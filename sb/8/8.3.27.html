<h2>Text</h2>
yoga-randhita-karmano
hrdi yoga-vibhavite
yogino yam prapasyanti
yogesam tam nato 'smy aham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yoga-randhita-karmanah--persons whose reactions to fruitive activities have been burnt up by bhaktiyoga;
hrdi--within the core of the heart; yoga-vibhavite--completely purified and clean; yoginah--mystics
who are competent; yam--unto the Personality of Godhead who; prapasyanti--directly see; yoga-isam--
unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic yoga; tam--unto Him; natah asmi--
offering obeisances; aham--I.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, the Supersoul, the master of all mystic yoga, who is
seen in the core of the heart by perfect mystics when they are completely purified and freed from the
reactions of fruitive activity by practicing bhakti-yoga.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The King of the elephants, Gajendra, simply accepted that there must be someone who has created this
cosmic manifestation and has supplied its ingredients. This should be admitted by everyone, even the
most determined atheists. Why, then, do the nondevotees and atheists not admit this? The reason is that
they are polluted by the reactions of their fruitive activities. One must be freed from all the dirt
accumulated within the heart due to fruitive activities performed one after another. One must wash off
this dirt by practicing bhakti-yoga. Yoga-randhita-karmanah. As long as one is covered by material
nature's modes of ignorance and passion, there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Lord. Tada
rajas-tamo-bhavah kama-lobhadayas ca ye. When one is freed from the modes of ignorance and passion,
one becomes free from the lowest qualities--kama and lobha, lust and greed.
Nowadays there are so many yoga schools to encourage people in developing their lusty desires and
greed through the practice of yoga. People are therefore very much fond of so-called yoga practice. The
actual practice of yoga, however, is described here. As authoritatively stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam
(12.13.1), dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah: a yogi is one who always meditates
on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in the Brahma-samhita
(5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Syamasundara, Krsna Himself, with inconceivable
innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion
tinged with the salve of love." The bhakti-yogi constantly sees Syamasundara--beautiful Lord Krsna with
His blackish bodily hue. Because the King of the elephants, Gajendra, thought himself an ordinary animal,
he thought himself unfit to see the Lord. In his humility, he thought that he could not practice yoga. In
other words, how can those who are like animals in the bodily concept of life, and who have no purity of
consciousness, practice yoga? In the present day, people who have no control over their senses, who have
no understanding of philosophy and who do not follow religious principles or rules and regulations are
nonetheless pretending to be yogis. This is the greatest anomaly in the practice of mystic yoga.
