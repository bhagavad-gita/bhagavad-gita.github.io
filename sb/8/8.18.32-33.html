<h2>Translation</h2>
These associates, headed by Sunanda and other chief associates and accompanied by all the
predominating deities of the various planets, offered prayers to the Lord, who wore a brilliant helmet,
bracelets, and glittering earrings that resembled fish. On the Lord's bosom were the lock of hair called
Srivatsa and the transcendental jewel named Kaustubha. He wore a yellow garment, covered by a belt, and
He was decorated by a flower garland, surrounded by bees. Manifesting Himself in this way, O King, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose activities are wonderful, covered the entire surface of the earth
with one footstep, the sky with His body, and all directions with His arms.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One might argue, "Since Bali Maharaja promised Vamanadeva only the land occupied by His steps, why
did Lord Vamanadeva occupy the sky also?" In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami says that the steps include
everything, downward and upward. When one stands up, he certainly occupies certain parts of the sky
and certain portions of the earth below his feet. Thus there was nothing uncommon for the Supreme
Personality of Godhead when He occupied the entire sky with His body.
