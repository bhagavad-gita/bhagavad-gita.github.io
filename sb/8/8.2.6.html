<h2>Text</h2>
yatra sangita-sannadair
nadad-guham amarsaya
abhigarjanti harayah
slaghinah para-sankaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatra--in that mountain (Trikuta); sangita--of singing; sannadaih--with the vibrations; nadat--
resounding; guham--the caves; amarsaya--because of unbearable anger or envy; abhigarjanti--roar;
harayah--the lions; slaghinah--being very proud of their strength; para-sankaya--because of suspecting
another lion.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of the resounding vibrations of the denizens of heaven singing in the caves, the lions there,
being very proud of their strength, roar with unbearable envy, thinking that another lion is roaring in that
way.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the higher planetary systems, there are not only different types of human beings, but also animals like
lions and elephants. There are trees, and the land is made of emeralds. Such is the creation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung in this regard, kesava! tuya jagata vicitra:
"My Lord Kesava, Your creation is colorful and full of varieties." Geologists, botanists and other so-called
scientists speculate about other planetary systems, but being unable to estimate the varieties on other
planets, they falsely imagine that all planets but this one are vacant, uninhabited, and full of dust.
Although they cannot even estimate the varieties existing throughout the universe, they are very proud of
their knowledge, and they are accepted as learned by persons of a similar caliber. As described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (2.3.19), sva-vid-varahostra-kharaih samstutah purusah pasuh: materialistic leaders are
praised by dogs, hogs, camels and asses, and they themselves are also big animals. One should not be
satisfied with the knowledge imparted by a big animal. Rather, one must take knowledge from a perfect
person like Sukadeva Gosvami. Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah: our duty is to follow the instructions of
the mahajanas. There are twelve mahajanas, and Sukadeva Gosvami is one of them.
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
(Bhag. 6.3.20)
Vaiyasaki is Sukadeva Gosvami. Whatever he says we consider to be factual. That is perfect knowledge.
