<h2>Translation</h2>
O Supreme Lord, for self-realization I surrender unto You, who are worshiped by the demigods as the
supreme controller of everything. By Your instructions, exposing life's purpose, kindly cut the knot from
the core of my heart and let me know the destination of my life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes it is argued that people do not know who is a spiritual master and that finding a spiritual
master from whom to get enlightenment in regard to the destination of life is very difficult. To answer all
these questions, King Satyavrata shows us the way to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the
real spiritual master. The Supreme Lord has given full directions in Bhagavad-gita about how to deal with
everything in this material world and how to return home, back to Godhead. Therefore, one should not be
misled by so-called gurus who are rascals and fools. Rather, one should directly see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as the guru or instructor. It is difficult, however, to understand Bhagavad-gita
without the help of the guru. Therefore the guru appears in the parampara system. In Bhagavad-gita
(4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends:
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
Lord Krsna directly instructed Arjuna. Arjuna is therefore tattva-darsi or guru. Arjuna accepted the
Supreme Personality of Godhead (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan). Similarly,
following in the footsteps of Sri Arjuna, who is a personal devotee of the Lord, one should accept the
supremacy of Lord Krsna, as supported by Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada and later by the acaryas
Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Nimbarka and Visnusvami and still later by the greatest acarya, Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Where, then, is the difficulty in finding a guru? If one is sincere he can find the
guru and learn everything. One should take lessons from the guru and find out the goal of life. Maharaja
Satyavrata, therefore, shows us the way of the mahajana. Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah. One should
surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dasavatara) and learn from Him about the spiritual
world and the goal of life.
