<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, I, who am considered to be the best of the demigods, and Lord Brahma and the great rsis,
headed by Marici, are born of the mode of goodness. Nonetheless, we are bewildered by Your illusory
energy and cannot understand what this creation is. Aside from us, what is to be said of others, like the
demons and human beings, who are in the base modes of material nature [rajo-guna and tamo-guna]?
How will they know You?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Factually speaking, even those who are situated in the material mode of goodness cannot understand
the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What then is to be said of those who are situated in
rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the base qualities of material nature? How can we even imagine the Supreme
Personality of Godhead? There are so many philosophers trying to understand the Absolute Truth, but
since they are situated in the base qualities of material nature and are addicted to so many bad habits, like
drinking, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling, how can they conceive of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead? For them it is impossible. For the present day, the pancaratriki-vidhi as enunciated by Narada
Muni is the only hope. Srila Rupa Gosvami, therefore, has quoted the following verse from the Brahmayamala:
sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-
vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, puranas
and Narada-pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
1.2.101) Those who are very advanced in knowledge and are situated in the mode of goodness follow the
Vedic instructions of the sruti and smrti and other religious scriptures, including the pancaratriki-vidhi.
Without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this way, one only creates a disturbance.
In this age of Kali, so many gurus have sprung up, and because they do not refer to the sruti-smrtipuranadi-
pancaratrika-vidhi, they are creating a great disturbance in the world in regard to understanding
the Absolute Truth. However, those who follow the pancaratriki-vidhi under the guidance of a proper
spiritual master can understand the Absolute Truth. It is said, pancaratrasya krtsnasya vakta tu bhagavan
svayam: the pancaratra system is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just like Bhagavad-gita.
Vasudeva-sarana vidur anjasaiva: the truth can be understood only by one who has taken shelter of the
lotus feet of Vasudeva.
bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be
the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare." (Bg. 7.19) Only those who have
surrendered to the lotus feet of Vasudeva can understand the Absolute Truth.
vasudeve bhagavati
bhakti-yogah prayojitah
janayaty asu vairagyam
jnanam ca yad ahaitukam
"By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires
causeless knowledge and detachment from the world." (Bhag. 1.2.7) Therefore, Vasudeva, Bhagavan Sri
Krsna, personally teaches in Bhagavad-gita:
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." (Bg. 18.66)
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." (Bg. 18.55) The
Supreme Personality of Godhead is not properly understood even by Lord Siva or Lord Brahma, what to
speak of others, but He can be understood by the process of bhakti-yoga.
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
(Bg. 7.1)
If one practices bhakti-yoga by taking shelter of Vasudeva, Krsna, simply by hearing Vasudeva speak
about Himself, one can understand everything about Him. Indeed, one can understand Him completely
(samagram).
