<h2>Text</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca
vacas tavaitaj jana-deva sunrtam
kulocitam dharma-yutam yasas-karam
yasya pramanam bhrgavah samparaye
pitamahah kula-vrddhah prasantah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; vacah--words; tava--your; etat--this kind
of; jana-deva--O King of the people; su-nrtam--very true; kula-ucitam--exactly befitting your dynasty;
dharma-yutam--completely in accord with the principles of religion; yasah-karam--fit for spreading your
reputation; yasya--of whom; pramanam--the evidence; bhrgavah--the brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty;
samparaye--in the next world; pitamahah--your grandfather; kula-vrddhah--the oldest in the family;
prasantah--very peaceful (Prahlada Maharaja).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O King, you are indeed exalted because your present
advisors are the brahmanas who are descendants of Bhrgu and because your instructor for your future life
is your grandfather, the peaceful and venerable Prahlada Maharaja. Your statements are very true, and
they completely agree with religious etiquette. They are in keeping with the behavior of your family, and
they enhance your reputation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja is a vivid example of a pure devotee. Someone might argue that since Prahlada
Maharaja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Maharaja,
how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word prasantah. A devotee is always
sober. He is never disturbed by any conditions. Even if a devotee remains in grhastha life and does not
renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be prasanta, sober, because of his pure
devotion to the Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore said:
kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya
yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei 'guru' haya
"Whether one is a brahmana, a sannyasi or a sudra--regardless of what he is--he can become a spiritual
master if he knows the science of Krsna." (Cc. Madhya 8.128) Anyone completely aware of the science of
Krsna, regardless of his status in life, is a guru. Thus Prahlada Maharaja is a guru in all circumstances.
Here His Lordship Vamanadeva also teaches sannyasis and brahmacaris that one should not ask more
than necessary. He wanted only three paces of land, although Bali Maharaja wanted to give Him anything
He wanted.
