<h2>Translation</h2>
Seeing the situation that had been created by the will of the Supreme, the unlimitedly powerful Lord,
whose determination is infallible, took the wonderful shape of a tortoise, entered the water, and lifted the
great Mandara Mountain.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is evidence that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller of everything. As
we have previously described, there are two classes of men--the demons and the demigods--but neither of
them are supremely powerful. Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the
supreme power. The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept
them to be acts of the supreme ruler. When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord.
Tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam. Devotees endure hindrances,
accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions.
Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as
accidental. Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally. It was by His will
that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed. The Lord appeared as a
tortoise to support the great mountain. Ksitir iha vipulatare tava tisthati prsthe. The Lord held the great
mountain on His back. Kesava dhrta-kurma-sarira jaya jagadisa hare. Dangers can be created by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they can also be removed by Him. This is known to devotees, but
demons cannot understand it.
