<h2>Translation</h2>
Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and
always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus they always
merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction. I,
however, am in danger. Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing,
who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahma, and who is available only by
transcendental bhakti-yoga. Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and
transcendental to all external realization. He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely
full in everything. I offer my obeisances unto Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." Unalloyed devotees have nothing to ask from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was circumstantially asking for an immediate
benediction because he had no other way to be rescued. Sometimes, when there is no alternative, a pure
devotee, being fully dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, prays for some benediction. But in
such a prayer there is also regret. One who always hears and chants about the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord is always situated on a platform on which he has nothing to ask in terms of material benefits.
Unless one is a completely pure devotee, one cannot enjoy the transcendental bliss derived from chanting
and dancing in the ecstasy of the sankirtana movement. Such ecstasy is not possible for an ordinary
devotee. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed us how one can enjoy transcendental bliss simply by
chanting, hearing and dancing in ecstasy. This is bhakti-yoga. Therefore the King of the elephants,
Gajendra, said, adhyatmika-yoga-gamyam, indicating that unless one is situated on this transcendental
platform, one cannot approach the Supreme Lord. The benediction of being able to approach the Lord can
be achieved after many, many births, yet Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has awarded this benediction to
everyone, even to the fallen souls who have no heritage of anything in spiritual life. That is actually being
seen in the Krsna consciousness movement. Therefore the path of bhakti-yoga is the spotless process by
which to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: only through
devotional service can one approach the Supreme Lord. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1):
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
"Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind
attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." Simply by being attached to Krsna
consciousness and by thinking of the lotus feet of Krsna constantly, one can fully understand the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, without a doubt.
