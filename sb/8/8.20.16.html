<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja said: My Lord, it is Your Lordship who gave this Bali the very great opulence of the
post of heavenly king, and now, today, it is You who have taken it all away. I think You have acted with
equal beauty in both ways. Because his exalted position as King of heaven was putting him in the darkness
of ignorance, You have done him a very merciful favor by taking away all his opulence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As it is said, yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih (Bhag. 10.88.8). It is by the mercy of the
Lord that one gets all material opulence, but if such material opulence causes one to become puffed up
and forget the process of self-realization, the Lord certainly takes all the opulence away. The Lord bestows
mercy upon His devotee by helping him find out his constitutional position. For that purpose, the Lord is
always ready to help the devotee in every way. But material opulence is sometimes dangerous because it
diverts one's attention to false prestige by giving one the impression that he is the owner and master of
everything he surveys, although actually this is not the fact. To protect the devotee from such a
misunderstanding, the Lord, showing special mercy, sometimes takes away his material possessions.
Yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih.
