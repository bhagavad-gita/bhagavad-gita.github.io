<h2>Text</h2>
padam dvitiyam kramatas trivistapam
na vai trtiyaya tadiyam anv api
urukramasyanghrir upary upary atho
mahar-janabhyam tapasah param gatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
padam--step; dvitiyam--second; kramatah--advancing; tri-vistapam--all of the heavenly planets; na--not;
vai--indeed; trtiyaya--for the third step; tadiyam--of the Lord; anu api--only a spot of land remained;
urukramasya--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who performs uncommon activities; anghrih--steps
occupying above and below; upari upari--higher and higher; atho--now; mahah-janabhyam--than
Maharloka and Janaloka; tapasah--that Tapoloka; param--beyond that; gatah--approached.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As the Lord took His second step, He covered the heavenly planets. And not even a spot remained for
the third step, for the Lord's foot extended higher and higher, beyond Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and
even Satyaloka.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord's footstep exceeded the height of all the lokas, including Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka
and Satyaloka, His nails certainly pierced the covering of the universe. The universe is covered by the five
material elements (bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh kham). As stated in the sastra, these elements are in layers,
each ten times thicker than the previous one. Nonetheless, the nails of the Lord pierced through all these
layers and made a hole penetrating into the spiritual world. From this hole, the water of the Ganges
infiltrated into this material world, and therefore it is said, pada-nakha-nira janita jana-pavana
(Dasavatara-stotra 5). Because the Lord kicked a hole in the covering of the universe, the water of the
Ganges came into this material world to deliver all the fallen souls.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Bali Maharaja Surrenders the Universe."
Chapter Twenty-one
Bali Maharaja Arrested by the Lord
This chapter describes how Lord Visnu, desiring to advertise the glories of Bali Maharaja, arrested him
for not fulfilling his promise in regard to the Lord's third step.
With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe,
Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails. Thus Lord Brahma,
accompanied by great sages like Marici and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered
humble prayers and worship to the Lord. They washed the Lord's feet and worshiped Him with all
paraphernalia. Rksaraja, Jambavan, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord. When Bali Maharaja
was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry. Although Bali Maharaja warned them
not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Visnu. All of them were defeated, however, by Lord
Visnu's eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Maharaja's order, they all entered the lower planets
of the universe. Understanding Lord Visnu's purpose, Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, immediately
arrested Bali Maharaja with the ropes of Varuna. When Bali Maharaja was thus reduced to a helpless
position, Lord Visnu asked him for the third step of land. Because Lord Visnu appreciated Bali Maharaja's
determination and integrity, when Bali Maharaja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Visnu ascertained
that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven.
