<h2>Text</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca
katham kasyapa-dayadah
pumscalyam mayi sangatah
visvasam pandito jatu
kaminisu na yati hi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of Mohini-murti said; katham--
how is it so; kasyapa-dayadah--you are all descendants of Kasyapa Muni; pumscalyam--unto a prostitute
who agitates the minds of men; mayi--unto Me; sangatah--you come in My association; visvasam--faith;
panditah--those who are learned; jatu--at any time; kaminisu--unto a woman; na--never; yati--takes place;
hi--indeed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the form of Mohini, told the demons: O sons of Kasyapa Muni,
I am only a prostitute. Mow is it that you have so much faith in Me? A learned person never puts his faith
in a woman.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Canakya Pandita, the great politician and moral instructor, said, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu rajakulesu
ca: "Never put your faith in a woman or a politician." Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
who was pretending to be a woman, warned the demons against putting so much faith in Her, for She had
appeared as an attractive woman ultimately to cheat them. Indirectly disclosing the purpose for which She
had appeared before them, She said to the sons of Kasyapa, "How is this? You were all born of a great rsi,
yet you are putting your faith in a woman who is loitering here and there like a prostitute, unprotected by
father or husband. Women in general should not be trusted, and what to speak of a woman loitering like a
prostitute?" The word kamini is significant in this connection. Women, especially beautiful young
women, invoke the dormant lusty desires of a man. Therefore, according to Manu-samhita, every woman
should be protected, either by her husband, by her father or by her grown sons. Without such protection,
a woman will be exploited. Indeed, women like to be exploited by men. As soon as a woman is exploited
by a man, she becomes a common prostitute. This is explained by Mohini-murti, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
