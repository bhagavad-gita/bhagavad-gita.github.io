kva--where is; ca--also; atma--the spirit soul; prakrteh--to the material world; parah--transcendental;

hi--certainly; karanam--cause.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kasyapa Muni continued: What is this material body, made of five elements? It is different from the
spirit soul. Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body
is made. But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son. These illusory
relationships are caused by misunderstanding.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The spirit soul (atma or jiva) is certainly different from the body, which is a combination of five material
elements. This is a simple fact, but it is not understood unless one is spiritually educated. Kasyapa Muni
met his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, but the same misconception extends throughout the entire
universe and is also here on earth. There are different grades of living entities, but all of them are more or
less under the impression of the bodily conception of life. In other words, all living entities in this
material world are more or less devoid of spiritual education. The Vedic civilization, however, is based on
spiritual education, and spiritual education is the special basis on which Bhagavad-gita was spoken to
Arjuna. In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita, Krsna instructed Arjuna to understand that the spirit soul is
different from the body.
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
(Bg. 2.13) Unfortunately, this spiritual education is completely absent from modern human civilization.
No one understands his real self-interest, which lies with the spirit soul, not with the material body.
Education means spiritual education. To work hard in the bodily conception of life, without spiritual
education, is to live like an animal. Nayam deho deha-bhajam nr-loke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhujam ye
(Bhag. 5.5.1). People are working so hard simply for bodily comforts, without education regarding the
spirit soul. Thus they are living in a very risky civilization, for it is a fact that the spirit soul has to
transmigrate from one body to another (tatha dehantara-praptih). Without spiritual education, people are
kept in dark ignorance and do not know what will happen to them after the annihilation of the present
body. They are working blindly, and blind leaders are directing them. Andha yathandhair upaniyamanas
te 'pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah (Bhag. 7.5.31). A foolish person does not know that he is
completely under the bondage of material nature and that after death material nature will impose upon
him a certain type of body, which he will have to accept. He does not know that although in his present
body he may be a very important man, he may next get the body of an animal or tree because of his
ignorant activities in the modes of material nature. Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is trying
to give the true light of spiritual existence to all living entities. This movement is not very difficult to
understand, and people must take advantage of it, for it will save them from the risky life of
irresponsibility.
