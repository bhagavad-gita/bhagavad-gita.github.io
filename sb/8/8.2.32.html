<h2>Text</h2>
na mam ime jnataya aturam gajah
kutah karinyah prabhavanti mocitum
grahena pasena vidhatur avrto
'py aham ca tam yami param parayanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; mam--me; ime--all these; jnatayah--friends and relatives (the other elephants); aturam--in my
distress; gajah--the elephant; kutah--how; karinyah--my wives; prabhavanti--are able; mocitum--to deliver
(from this dangerous position); grahena--by the crocodile; pasena--by the network of ropes; vidhatuh--of
providence; avrtah--captured; api--although (I am in such a position); aham--I; ca--also; tam--that
(Supreme Personality of Godhead); yami--take shelter of; param--who is transcendental; parayanam--and
who is the shelter of even the exalted demigods like Brahma and Siva.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The other elephants, who are my friends and relatives, could not rescue me from this danger. What then
to speak of my wives? They cannot do anything. It is by the will of providence that I have been attacked
by this crocodile, and therefore I shall seek shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always
the shelter of everyone, even of great personalities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This material world is described as padam padam yad vipadam, which means that at every step there is
danger. A fool wrongly thinks that he is happy in this material world, but in fact he is not, for one who
thinks that way is only illusioned. At every step, at every moment, there is danger. In modern civilization
one thinks that if he has a nice home and a nice car his life is perfect. In the Western countries, especially
in America, it is very nice to possess a good car, but as soon as one is on the road, there is danger because
at any moment an accident may take place and one will be killed. The record actually shows that so many
people die in such accidents. Therefore if we actually think that this material world is a very happy place,
this is our ignorance. Real knowledge is that this material world is full of danger. We may struggle for
existence as far as our intelligence allows and may try to take care of ourselves, but unless the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, ultimately saves us from danger, our attempts will be useless. Therefore
Prahlada Maharaja says:
balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha
nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh
taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas
tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam
(Bhag. 7.9.19)
We may invent so many ways to be happy or to counteract the dangers of this material world, but unless
our attempts are sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they will never make us happy.
Those who try to be happy without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are mudhas,
rascals. Na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah. Those who are the lowest of men refuse to
take to Krsna consciousness because they think that they will be able to protect themselves without
Krsna's care. This is their mistake. The decision of the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was correct. In
such a dangerous position, he sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
