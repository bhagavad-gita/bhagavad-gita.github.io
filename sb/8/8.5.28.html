<h2>Translation</h2>
In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot. The ten
senses [five for working and five for gathering knowledge] and the five life airs within the body form the
fifteen spokes of the chariot's wheel. The three modes of nature [goodness, passion and ignorance] are its
center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature [earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and
false ego] comprise the rim of the wheel. The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical
energy. Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth. We offer our respectful obeisances unto Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The cycle of repeated birth and death is figuratively described herein. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.5):
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
The entire world is going on because the living entity, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is
utilizing the material energy. Under the clutches of the material energy, the jivatma is revolving on the
wheel of birth and death under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The central point is
the Supersoul. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):
isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati
bhramayan sarva-bhutani
yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." The material body of the
living entity is a result of the conditioned soul's activities, and because the supporter is the Supersoul, the
Supersoul is the true reality. Every one of us, therefore, should offer respectful obeisances to this central
reality. One should not be misguided by the activities of this material world and forget the central point,
the Absolute Truth. That is the instruction given here by Lord Brahma.
