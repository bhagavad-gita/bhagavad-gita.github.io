<h2>Text</h2>
sri-balir uvaca
aho brahmana-dayada
vacas te vrddha-sammatah
tvam balo balisa-matih
svartham praty abudho yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-balih uvaca--Bali Maharaja said; aho--alas; brahmana-dayada--O son of a brahmana; vacah--the
words; te--of You; vrddha-sammatah--are certainly acceptable to learned and elderly persons; tvam--You;
balah--a boy; balisa-matih--without sufficient knowledge; sva-artham--self-interest; prati--toward;
abudhah--not knowing sufficiently; yatha--as it should have been.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bali Maharaja said: O son of a brahmana, Your instructions are as good as those of learned and elderly
persons. Nonetheless, You are a boy, and Your intelligence is insufficient. Thus You are not very prudent
in regard to Your self-interest.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being full in Himself, actually has nothing to want for His selfinterest.
Lord Vamanadeva, therefore, had not gone to Bali Maharaja for His own self-interest. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram. The Lord is the proprietor of all
planets, in both the material and spiritual worlds. Why should He be in want of land? Bali Maharaja
rightly said that Lord Vamanadeva was not at all prudent in regard to His own personal interests. Lord
Vamanadeva had approached Bali not for His personal welfare but for the welfare of His devotees.
Devotees sacrifice all personal interests to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and similarly the
Supreme Lord, although having no personal interests, can do anything for the interests of His devotees.
One who is full in himself has no personal interests.
