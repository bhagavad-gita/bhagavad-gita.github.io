TRANSLATION
As one can derive fire from wood, milk from the milk bag of the cow, food grains and water from the
land, and prosperity in one's livelihood from industrial enterprises, so, by the practice of bhakti-yoga,
even within this material world, one can achieve Your favor or intelligently approach You. Those who are
pious all affirm this.
PURPORT
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is nirguna, not to be found within this material world,
the entire material world is pervaded by Him, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (maya tatam idam sarvam). The
material world is nothing but an expansion of the Lord's material energy, and the entire cosmic
manifestation rests upon Him (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani). Nonetheless, the Supreme Lord cannot be
found here (na caham tesv avasthitah). A devotee, however, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead
through the practice of bhakti-yoga. One ordinarily does not begin to practice bhakti-yoga unless he has
practiced it in previous births. Moreover, one can begin bhakti-yoga only by the mercy of the spiritual
master and Krsna. Guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija. The seed of devotional service is obtainable
by the mercy of guru, the spiritual master, and Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Only by the practice of bhakti-yoga can one achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and see Him face to face (premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti).
One cannot see the Lord by other methods, such as karma, jnana or yoga. Under the direction of the
spiritual master, one must cultivate bhakti-yoga (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam).
Then, even within this material world, although the Lord is not visible, a devotee can see Him. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah) and in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah). Thus by devotional service one can achieve the favor of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is not visible or understandable to materialistic persons.
In this verse, the cultivation of bhakti-yoga is compared to many material activities. By friction one can
get fire from wood, by digging the earth one can get food grains and water, and by agitating the milk bag
of the cow one can get nectarean milk. Milk is compared to nectar, which one can drink to become
immortal. Of course, simply drinking milk will not make one immortal, but it can increase the duration of
one's life. In modern civilization, men do not think milk to be important, and therefore they do not live
very long. Although in this age men can live up to one hundred years, their duration of life is reduced
because they do not drink large quantities of milk. This is a sign of Kali-yuga. In Kali-yuga, instead of
drinking milk, people prefer to slaughter an animal and eat its flesh. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead, in His instructions of Bhagavad-gita, advises go-raksya, which means cow protection. The cow
should be protected, milk should be drawn from the cows, and this milk should be prepared in various
ways. One should take ample milk, and thus one can prolong one's life, develop his brain, execute
devotional service, and ultimately attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As it is
essential to get food grains and water by digging the earth, it is also essential to give protection to the
cows and take nectarean milk from their milk bags.
The people of this age are inclined toward industrial enterprises for comfortable living, but they refuse
to endeavor to execute devotional service, by which they can achieve the ultimate goal of life by returning
home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, as it is said, na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum durasaya ye
bahir-artha-maninah. People without spiritual education do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to go
back home, back to Godhead. Forgetting this aim of life, they are working very hard in disappointment
and frustration (moghasa mogha-karmano mogha jnana vicetasah). The so-called vaisyas--the
industrialists or businessmen--are involved in big, big industrial enterprises, but they are not interested in
food grains and milk. However, as indicated here, by digging for water, even in the desert, we can produce
food grains; when we produce food grains and vegetables, we can give protection to the cows; while
giving protection to the cows, we can draw from them abundant quantities of milk; and by getting enough
milk and combining it with food grains and vegetables, we can prepare hundreds of nectarean foods. We
can happily eat this food and thus avoid industrial enterprises and joblessness.
Agriculture and cow protection are the way to become sinless and thus be attracted to devotional
service. Those who are sinful cannot be attracted by devotional service. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." The majority of people in this age of Kali are sinful, short-living, unfortunate and
disturbed (mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah). For them, Caitanya Mahaprabhu has
advised:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the
Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way."
