<h2>Text</h2>
skanne retasi so 'pasyad
atmanam deva-mayaya
jadikrtam nrpa-srestha
sannyavartata kasmalat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
skanne--when fully discharged; retasi--the semen; sah--Lord Siva; apasyat--saw; atmanam--his own self;
deva-mayaya--by the maya of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; jadikrtam--had become victimized as a
fool; nrpa-srestha--O best of kings (Maharaja Pariksit); sannyavartata--restrained himself further;
kasmalat--from illusion.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Maharaja Pariksit, best of kings, when Lord Siva had fully discharged semen, he could see how he
himself had been victimized by the illusion created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus he
restrained himself from any further maya.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Once one is agitated by lusty desires upon seeing a woman, those desires increase more and more, but
when semen is discharged in the act of sex, the lusty desires diminish. The same principle acted upon
Lord Siva. He was allured by the beautiful woman Mohini-murti, but when his semen had been fully
discharged, he came to his senses and realized how he had been victimized as soon as he saw the woman
in the forest. If one is trained to protect his semen by observing celibacy, naturally he is not attracted by
the beauty of a woman. If one can remain a brahmacari, he saves himself so much trouble in material
existence. Material existence means enjoying the pleasure of sexual intercourse (yan maithunadigrhamedhi-
sukham). If one is educated about sex life and is trained to protect his semen, he is saved from
the danger of material existence.
