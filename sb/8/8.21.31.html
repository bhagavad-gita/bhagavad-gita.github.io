<h2>Translation</h2>
Whenever the activities of Vamanadeva are described in the course of a ritualistic ceremony, whether
the ceremony be performed to please the demigods, to please one's forefathers in Pitrloka, or to celebrate
a social event like a marriage, that ceremony should be understood to be extremely auspicious.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three kinds of ceremonies--specifically, ceremonies to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead or the demigods, those performed for social celebrations like marriages and birthdays, and those
meant to please the forefathers, like the sraddha ceremony. In all these ceremonies, large amounts of
money are spent for various activities, but here it is suggested that if along with this there is recitation of
the wonderful activities of Vamanadeva, certainly the ceremony will be carried out successfully and will
be free of all discrepancies.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Demigods Regain the Heavenly planets."
Chapter Twenty-four
Matsya, the Lord's Fish Incarnation
This chapter describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead's incarnation as a fish, and it also describes
the saving of Maharaja Satyavrata from an inundation.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself by svamsa (His personal expansions) and
vibhinnamsa (His expansions as the living entities). As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4. 8), paritranaya
sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears on this planet for the
protection of the sadhus, or devotees, and for the destruction of the miscreants, or nondevotees. He
especially descends to give protection to the cows, the brahmanas, the demigods, the devotees and the
Vedic system of religion. Thus He appears in various forms--sometimes as a fish, sometimes a boar,
sometimes Nrsimhadeva, sometimes Vamanadeva and so on--but in any form or incarnation, although He
comes within the atmosphere of the material modes of nature, He is unaffected. This is a sign of His
supreme controlling power. Although He comes within the material atmosphere, maya cannot touch Him.
Therefore, no material qualities can be attributed to Him in any degree.
Once, at the end of the previous kalpa, a demon named Hayagriva wanted to take the Vedic knowledge
away from Lord Brahma at the time of annihilation. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead took
the incarnation of a fish at the beginning of the period of Svayambhuva Manu and saved the Vedas.
During the reign of Caksusa Manu there was a king named Satyavrata, who was a great pious ruler. To
save him, the Lord appeared as the fish incarnation for a second time. King Satyavrata later became the
son of the sun-god and was known as Sraddhadeva. He was established as Manu by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
To receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Satyavrata engaged in the austerity of
subsisting only by drinking water. Once, while performing this austerity on the bank of the Krtamala
River and offering oblations of water with the palm of his hand, he found a small fish. The fish appealed
to the King for protection, asking the King to keep Him in a safe place. Although the King did not know
that the small fish was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, as a king he gave shelter to the fish
and kept Him in a water jug. The fish, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, wanted to show His
potency to King Satyavrata, and thus He immediately expanded His body in such a way that He could no
longer be kept in the jug of water. The King then put the fish in a big well, but the well was also too small.
Then the King put the fish in a lake, but the lake was also unsuitable. Finally the King put the fish in the
sea, but even the sea could not accommodate Him. Thus the King understood that the fish was no one
else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he requested the Lord to describe His incarnation as a
fish. The Personality of Godhead, being pleased with the King, informed him that within a week there
would be an inundation throughout the universe and that the fish incarnation would protect the King,
along with the rsis, herbs, seeds and other living entities, in a boat, which would be attached to the fish's
horn. After saying this, the Lord disappeared. King Satyavrata offered respectful obeisances to the
Supreme Lord and continued to meditate upon Him. In due course of time, annihilation took place, and
the King saw a boat coming near. After getting aboard with learned brahmanas and saintly persons, he
offered prayers to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Lord is situated in
everyone's heart, and thus he taught Maharaja Satyavrata and the saintly persons about Vedic knowledge
from the core of the heart. King Satyavrata took his next birth as Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in
Bhagavad-gita. Vivasvan manave praha: the sun-god spoke the science of Bhagavad-gita to his son Manu.
Because of being the son of Vivasvan, this Manu is known as Vaivasvata Manu.
