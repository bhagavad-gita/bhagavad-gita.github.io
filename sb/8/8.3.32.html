<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Gajendra had been forcefully captured by the crocodile in the water and was feeling acute pain, but
when he saw that Narayana, wielding His disc, was coming in the sky on the back of Garuda, he
immediately took a lotus flower in his trunk, and with great difficulty due to his painful condition, he
uttered the following words: "O my Lord, Narayana, master of the universe, O Supreme Personality of
Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The King of the elephants was so very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead that when he
saw the Lord coming in the sky, with great pain and in a feeble voice he offered respect to the Lord. A
devotee does not consider a dangerous position to be dangerous, for in such a dangerous position he can
fervently pray to the Lord in great ecstasy. Thus a devotee regards danger as a good opportunity. Tat
te'nukampam susamiksamanah. When a devotee is in great danger, he sees that danger to be the great
mercy of the Lord because it is an opportunity to think of the Lord very sincerely and with undiverted
attention. Tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam (Bhag. 10.14.8). He does
not accuse the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having let His devotee fall into such a dangerous
condition. Rather, he considers that dangerous condition to be due to his past misdeeds and takes it as an
opportunity to pray to the Lord and offer thanks for having been given such an opportunity. When a
devotee lives in this way, his salvation--his going back home, back to Godhead--is guaranteed. We can see
this to be true from the example of Gajendra, who anxiously prayed to the Lord and thus received an
immediate chance to return home, back to Godhead.
