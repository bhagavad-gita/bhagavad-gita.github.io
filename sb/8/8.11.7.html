<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, You are the Supreme Brahman, complete in everything. Being completely spiritual, You are
eternal, free from the material modes of nature, and full of transcendental bliss. Indeed, for You there is
no question of lamentation. Since You are the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, nothing can exist
without You. Yet we are different from You in a relationship of cause and effect, for in one sense the cause
and effect are different. You are the original cause of creation, manifestation and annihilation, and You
bestow benedictions upon all living entities. Everyone depends upon You for the results of his activities,
but You are always independent.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita (9.4):
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in
them." This explains the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference, known as acintyabhedabheda.
Everything is the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, yet the Supreme Person is
differently situated from everything. Indeed, because the Lord is differently situated from everything
material, He is the Supreme Brahman, the supreme cause, the supreme controller. Isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah. The Lord is the supreme cause, and His form has nothing to do with the
material modes of nature. The devotee prays: "As Your devotee is completely free from all desires, Your
Lordship is also completely free from desires. You are fully independent. Although all living entities
engage in Your service, You do not depend on the service of anyone. Although this material world is
created complete by You, everything depends on Your sanction. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, mattah smrtir
jnanam apohanam ca: remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness come from You. Nothing can be done
independently, yet You act independently of the service rendered by Your servants. The living entities
depend on Your mercy for liberation, but when You want to give them liberation, You do not depend on
anyone else. Indeed, by Your causeless mercy, You can give liberation to anyone. Those who receive Your
mercy are called krpa-siddha. To reach the platform of perfection takes many, many lives (bahunam
janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate). Nonetheless, even without undergoing severe austerities, one
can attain perfection by Your mercy. Devotional service should be unmotivated and free from
impediments (ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati). This is the position of nirasisah, or freedom from
expectations for results. A pure devotee continuously offers transcendental loving service to You, but You
may nonetheless offer mercy to anyone, without depending on his service."
