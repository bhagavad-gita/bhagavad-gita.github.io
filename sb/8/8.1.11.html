<h2>Text</h2>
yam pasyati na pasyantam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yam--He who; pasyati--the living entity sees; na--not; pasyantam--although always seeing; caksuh--eye;
yasya--whose; na--never; risyati--diminishes; tam--Him; bhuta-nilayam--the original source of all living
entities; devam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; suparnam--who accompanies the living entity as a
friend; upadhavata--everyone should worship.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly watches the activities of the world, no one
sees Him. However, one should not think that because no one sees Him, He does not see, for His power to
see is never diminished. Therefore, everyone should worship the Supersoul, who always stays with the
individual soul as a friend.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Offering prayers to Krsna, Srimati Kuntidevi, the mother of the Pandavas, said, alaksyam sarvabhutanam
antar bahir avasthitam: "Krsna, You reside both inside and outside of everything, yet the
unintelligent conditioned souls cannot see You." In Bhagavad-gita it is said that one can see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead through jnana-caksusah, eyes of knowledge. He who opens these eyes of
knowledge is called a spiritual master. Thus we offer our prayers to the spiritual master with the following
sloka:
om ajnana-timirandhasya
jnananjana-salakaya
caksur unmilitam yena
tasmai sri-gurave namah
"I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has
opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance." (Gautamiya Tantra) The guru's task
is to open the disciple's eyes of knowledge. When the disciple is awakened from ignorance to knowledge,
he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere because the Lord actually is everywhere.
Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham. The Lord resides within this universe, He resides within the
hearts of all living entities, and He resides even within the atom. Because we lack perfect knowledge, we
cannot see God, but a little deliberation can help us to see God everywhere. This requires training. With a
little deliberation, even the most degraded person can perceive the presence of God. If we take into
account whose property is the vast ocean, whose property is the vast land, how the sky exists, how the
numberless millions of stars and planets are set in the sky, who has made this universe and whose
property it is, we should certainly come to the conclusion that there is a proprietor of everything. When
we claim proprietorship over a certain piece of land, whether individually or for our families or nations,
we should also consider how we became the proprietors. The land was there before our birth, before we
came to the land. How did it become our property? Such deliberation will help us understand that there is
a supreme proprietor of everything--the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The Supreme Godhead is always awake. In the conditioned stage we forget things because we change
our bodies, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not change His body, He remembers
past, present and future. Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.1), imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham
avyayam: "I spoke this science of God--Bhagavad-gita--to the sun-god at least forty million years ago."
When Arjuna inquired from Krsna how He could remember incidents that had taken place so long ago,
the Lord answered that Arjuna was also present at that time. Because Arjuna is Krsna's friend, wherever
Krsna goes, Arjuna goes. But the difference is that Krsna remembers everything, whereas the living entity
like Arjuna, being a minute particle of the Supreme Lord, forgets. Therefore it is said, the Lord's vigilance
is never diminished. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15). Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature is
always present within the hearts of all living entities, and from Him come memory, knowledge and
forgetfulness. This is also indicated in this verse by the word suparnam, which means "friend." In the
Svetasvatara Upanisad (4.6) it is therefore said, dva suparna-sayuja sakhaya samanam vrksam
parisasvajate: two birds are sitting on the same tree as friends. One bird is eating the fruit of the tree, and
the other is simply observing. This observing bird is always present as a friend to the eating bird and
giving him remembrance of things he wanted to do. Thus if we take into account the Supreme Personality
of Godhead in our daily affairs, we can see Him or at least perceive His presence everywhere.
The words caksur yasya na risyati mean that although we cannot see Him, this does not mean that He
cannot see us. Nor does He die when the cosmic manifestation is annihilated. The example is given in this
connection that the sunshine is present when the sun is present, but when the sun is not present, or when
we cannot see the sun, this does not mean that the sun is lost. The sun is there, but we cannot see it.
Similarly, although we cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our present darkness, our lack
of knowledge, He is always present, seeing our activities. As the Paramatma, He is the witness and adviser
(upadrasta and anumanta). Therefore, by following the instructions of the spiritual master and studying
authorized literatures, one can understand that God is present before us, seeing everything, although we
have no eyes with which to see Him.
