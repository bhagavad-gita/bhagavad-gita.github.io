<h2>Translation</h2>
The entire cosmic manifestation is the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth,
who has millions of names and unlimited potencies. He is self-effulgent, unborn and changeless. He is the
beginning of everything, but He has no beginning. Because He has created this cosmic manifestation by
His external energy, the universe appears to be created, maintained and annihilated by Him. Nonetheless,
He remains inactive in His spiritual energy and is untouched by the activities of the material energy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says in His Siksastaka, namnam akari bahudha nija-sarva-saktih: the Supreme
Personality of Godhead has many names, which are all nondifferent from the Supreme Person. This is
spiritual existence. By chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, consisting of names of the Supreme Lord,
we find that the name has all the potencies of the person. The Lord's activities are many, and according to
His activities He has many names. He appeared as the son of mother Yasoda, and also as the son of mother
Devaki, and therefore He is named Devaki-nandana and Yasoda-nandana. Parasya saktir vividhaiva
sruyate: the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways. Yet He has a
particular name. The sastras recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna,
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one. Rather, we
must follow the saintly persons and the sastras in chanting His holy name.
Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as
long as we are in the material energy. And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know.
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.7.23): mayam vyudasya cic-chaktya kaivalye sthita atmani. Although
the external energy belongs to the Lord, when one is in the external energy (mama maya duratyaya) He is
very difficult to understand. However, when one comes to the spiritual energy, one can understand Him.
Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (18.55) it is said, bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: one who
wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in reality must take to the platform of bhakti, or
Krsna consciousness. This bhakti consists of various activities (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam
pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam), and to understand the Lord one
must take to this path of devotional service. Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and
may say that God is dead, this is not a fact. One can understand God when one takes to the Krsna
consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy.
