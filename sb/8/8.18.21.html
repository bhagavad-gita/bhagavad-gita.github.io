more; adbhutam--certainly very wonderful; hareh--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; anantasya--of
the unlimited; guna-traya-atmakam--whose body is expanded by the material energy, consisting of three

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had assumed the form of Vamana, then began
increasing in size, acting in terms of the material energy, until everything in the universe was within His
body, including the earth, the planetary systems, the sky, the directions, the various holes in the universe,
the seas, the oceans, the birds, beasts, human beings, the demigods and the great saintly persons.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja wanted to give charity to Vamanadeva, but the Lord expanded His body in such a way
that He showed Bali Maharaja that everything in the universe is already in His body. Actually, no one can
give anything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is full in everything. Sometimes we see a
devotee offering Ganges water to the Ganges. After taking his bath in the Ganges, a devotee takes a
palmful of water and offers it back to the Ganges. Actually, when one takes a palmful of water from the
Ganges, the Ganges does not lose anything, and similarly if a devotee offers a palmful of water to the
Ganges, the Ganges does not increase in any way. But by such an offering, the devotee becomes celebrated
as a devotee of mother Ganges. Similarly, when we offer anything with devotion and faith, what we offer
does not belong to us, nor does it enrich the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But if one
offers whatever he has in his possession, he becomes a recognized devotee. In this regard, the example is
given that when one's face is decorated with a garland and sandalwood pulp, the reflection of one's face in
a mirror automatically becomes beautiful. The original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is our original source also. Therefore when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
decorated, the devotees and all living entities are decorated automatically.
