<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
viraktah kama-bhogesu
satarupa-patih prabhuh
visrjya rajyam tapase
sabharyo vanam avisat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
viraktah--without attachment; kama-bhogesu--in sense gratification (in grhastha life); satarupa-patih--
the husband of Satarupa, namely Svayambhuva Manu; prabhuh--who was the master or king of the world;
visrjya--after renouncing totally; rajyam--his kingdom; tapase--for practicing austerities; sa-bharyah--with
his wife; vanam--the forest; avisat--entered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Svayambhuva Manu, the husband of Satarupa, was by nature not at all attached to enjoyment of the
senses. Thus he gave up his kingdom of sense enjoyment and entered the forest with his wife to practice
austerities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.2), evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh: "The supreme science
was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that
way." All the Manus were perfect kings. They were rajarsis. In other words, although they held posts as
kings of the world, they were as good as great saints. Svayambhuva Manu, for example, was the emperor
of the world, yet he had no desire for sense gratification. This is the meaning of monarchy. The king of
the country or the emperor of the empire must be so trained that by nature he renounces sense
gratification. It is not that because one becomes king he should unnecessarily spend money for sense
gratification. As soon as kings became degraded, spending money for sense gratification, they were lost.
Similarly, at the present moment, monarchy having been lost, the people have created democracy, which
is also failing. Now, by the laws of nature, the time is coming when dictatorship will put the citizens into
more and more difficulty. If the king or dictator individually, or the members of the government
collectively, cannot maintain the state or kingdom according to the rules of Manu-samhita, certainly their
government will not endure.
