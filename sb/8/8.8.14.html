<h2>Text</h2>
tato 'bhisisicur devim
sriyam padma-karam satim
digibhah purna-kalasaih
sukta-vakyair dvijeritaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--thereafter; abhisisicuh--poured all-auspicious water on the body; devim--the goddess of fortune;
sriyam--very beautiful; padma-karam--with a lotus in her hand; satim--she who is most chaste, not
knowing anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead; digibhah--the great elephants; purna-kalasaih--
by completely full water jugs; sukta-vakyaih--with Vedic mantras; dvi-ja--by brahmanas; iritaih--chanted.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, the great elephants from all the directions carried big water jugs full of Ganges water and
bathed the goddess of fortune, to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras chanted by learned brahmanas.
While thus being bathed, the goddess of fortune maintained her original style, with a lotus flower in her
hand, and she appeared very beautiful. The goddess of fortune is the most chaste, for she does not know
anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is described in this verse as sriyam, which means that she has six
opulences--wealth, strength, influence, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. These opulences are
received from the goddess of fortune. Laksmi is addressed here as devi, the goddess, because in Vaikuntha
she supplies all opulences to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, who in this way
enjoy natural life in the Vaikuntha planets. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with His
consort, the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand. Mother Laksmi is described in this
verse as sati, the supremely chaste, because she never diverts her attention from the Supreme Personality
of Godhead to anyone else.
