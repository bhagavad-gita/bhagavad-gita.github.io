TRANSLATION
All learned men say that the five elements, eternal time, fruitive activity, the three modes of material
nature, and the varieties produced by these modes are all creations of yogamaya. This material world is
therefore extremely difficult to understand, but those who are highly learned have rejected it. May the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller of everything, be pleased with us.
PURPORT
The word durvibhavyam is very important in this verse. No one can understand how everything is
happening in this material world by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His
material energies. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.10), mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram:
everything is actually happening under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This much
we can learn, but how it is happening is extremely difficult to understand. We cannot even understand
how the affairs within our body are systematically taking place. The body is a small universe, and since we
cannot understand how things are happening in this small universe, how can we understand the affairs of
the bigger universe? Actually this universe is very difficult to understand, yet learned sages have advised,
as Krsna has also advised, that this material world is duhkhalayam asasvatam; in other words, it is a place
of misery and temporality. One must give up this world and go back home, back to the Personality of
Godhead. Materialists may argue, "If this material world and its affairs are impossible to understand, how
can we reject it?" The answer is provided by the word prabudhapabadham. We have to reject this material
world because it is rejected by those who are learned in Vedic wisdom. Even though we cannot
understand what this material world is, we should be ready to reject it in accordance with the advice of
learned persons, especially the advice of Krsna. Krsna says:
mam upetya punar janma
duhkhalayam asasvatam
napnuvanti mahatmanah
samsiddhim paramam gatah
"After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world,
which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection." (Bg. 8.15) One has to return
home, back to Godhead, for this is the highest perfection of life. To go back to Godhead means to reject
this material world. Although we cannot understand the functions of this material world and whether it is
good for us or bad for us, in accordance with the advice of the supreme authority we must reject it and go
back home, back to Godhead.
