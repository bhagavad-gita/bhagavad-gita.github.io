<h2>Text</h2>
satyam puspa-phalam vidyad
atma-vrksasya giyate
vrkse 'jivati tan na syad
anrtam mulam atmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
satyam--the factual truth; puspa-phalam--the flower and the fruit; vidyat--one should understand; atmavrksasya--
of the tree of the body; giyate--as described in the Vedas; vrkse ajivati--if the tree is not living;
tat--that (puspa-phalam); na--not; syat--is possible; anrtam--untruth; mulam--the root; atmanah--of the
body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Vedas enjoin that the factual result of the tree of the body is the good fruits and flowers derived
from it. But if the bodily tree does not exist, there is no possibility of factual fruits and flowers. Even if the
body is based on untruth, there cannot be factual fruits and flowers without the help of the bodily tree.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This sloka explains that in relation to the material body even the factual truth cannot exist without a
touch of untruth. The Mayavadis say, brahma satyam jagan mithya: "The spirit soul is truth, and the
external energy is untruth." The Vaisnava philosophers, however, do not agree with the Mayavada
philosophy. Even if for the sake of argument the material world is accepted as untruth, the living entity
entangled in the illusory energy cannot come out of it without the help of the body. Without the help of
the body, one cannot follow a system of religion, nor can one speculate on philosophical perfection.
Therefore, the flower and fruit (puspa-phalam) have to be obtained as a result of the body. Without the
help of the body, that fruit cannot be gained. The Vaisnava philosophy therefore recommends yuktavairagya.
It is not that all attention should be diverted for the maintenance of the body, but at the same
time one's bodily maintenance should not be neglected. As long as the body exists one can thoroughly
study the Vedic instructions, and thus at the end of life one can achieve perfection. This is explained in
Bhagavad-gita (8. 6): yam yam vapi smaran bhavam tyajaty ante kalevaram. Everything is examined at the
time of death. Therefore, although the body is temporary, not eternal, one can take from it the best service
and make one's life perfect.
