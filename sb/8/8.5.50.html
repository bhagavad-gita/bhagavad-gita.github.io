<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
namah--all obeisances; tubhyam--unto You, my Lord; anantaya--who are everlasting, transcending the
three phases of time (past, present and future); durvitarkya-atma-karmane--unto You, who perform
inconceivable activities; nirgunaya--which are all transcendental, free from the inebriety of material
qualities; guna-isaya--unto You, who control the three modes of material nature; sattva-sthaya--who are in
favor of the material quality of goodness; ca--also; sampratam--at present.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, all obeisances unto You, who are eternal, beyond time's limits of past, present and future. You
are inconceivable in Your activities, You are the master of the three modes of material nature, and, being
transcendental to all material qualities, You are free from material contamination. You are the controller
of all three of the modes of nature, but at the present You are in favor of the quality of goodness. Let us
offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the material activities manifested by the three modes of
material nature. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, nirgunam guna-bhoktr ca: the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is always transcendental to the material qualities (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna), but
nonetheless He is their controller. The Lord manifests Himself in three features--as Brahma, Visnu and
Mahesvara--to control these three qualities. He personally takes charge of sattva-guna as Lord Visnu, and
He entrusts the charge of rajo-guna and tamo-guna to Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Ultimately, however,
He is the controller of all three gunas. Lord Brahma, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord
Visnu had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would
be successful in fulfilling their desires. The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested
with tamo-guna. However, as Lord Brahma has previously described, since the time of sattva-guna had
now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires. The demigods are supposedly
well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the Lord is addressed here as anantaya. Although Lord Brahma knows past, present
and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Demigods Appeal to the Lord for Protection."
Chapter Six
The Demigods and Demons Declare a Truce
This chapter describes how the Lord appeared before the demigods when they offered Him their
prayers. Following the advice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods executed a truce with
the demons for the purpose of churning nectar from the sea.
Because of the prayers offered by the demigods in the previous chapter, Lord Ksirodakasayi Visnu was
pleased with the demigods, and thus He appeared before them. The demigods were almost blinded by His
transcendental bodily effulgence. At first, therefore, they could not even see any part of His body. After
some time, however, when Brahma could see the Lord, he, along with Lord Siva, began to offer the Lord
prayers.
Lord Brahma said: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being beyond birth and death, is eternal. He
has no material qualities. Yet He is the ocean of unlimited auspicious qualities. He is subtler than the most
subtle, He is invisible, and His form is inconceivable. He is worshipable for all the demigods. Innumerable
universes exist within His form, and therefore He is never separated from these universes by time, space
or circumstances. He is the chief and the pradhana. Although He is the beginning, the middle and the end
of the material creation, the idea of pantheism conceived by Mayavadi philosophers has no validity. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the entire material manifestation through His subordinate
agent, the external energy. Because of His inconceivable transcendental position, He is always the master
of the material energy. The Supreme personality of Godhead, in His various forms, is always present even
within this material world, but the material qualities cannot touch Him. One can understand His position
only by His instructions, as given in Bhagavad-gita." As stated in Bhagavad-gita (10.10), dadami buddhiyogam
tam. Buddhi-yoga means bhakti-yoga. Only through the process of bhakti-yoga can one
understand the Supreme Lord.
When offered prayers by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased.
Thus He gave appropriate instructions to all the demigods. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
known as Ajita, unconquerable, advised the demigods to make a peace proposal to the demons, so that
after formulating a truce, the demigods and demons could churn the ocean of milk. The rope would be
the biggest serpent, known as Vasuki, and the churning rod would be Mandara Mountain. Poison would
also be produced from the churning, but it would be taken by Lord Siva, and so there would be no need to
fear it. Many other attractive things would be generated by the churning, but the Lord warned the
demigods not to be captivated by such things. Nor should the demigods be angry if there were some
disturbances. After advising the demigods in this way, the Lord disappeared from the scene.
Following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods established a peace
with Maharaja Bali, the King of the demons. Then both the demons and the demigods started for the
ocean, taking Mandara Mountain with them. Because of the great heaviness of the mountain, the
demigods and demons became fatigued, and some of them actually died. Then the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Visnu, appeared there on the back of His carrier, Garuda, and by His mercy He brought these
demigods and demons back to life. The Lord then lifted the mountain with one of His hands and placed it
on the back of Garuda. The Lord sat on the mountain and was carried to the spot of the churning by
Garuda, who placed the mountain in the middle of the sea. Then the Lord asked Garuda to leave that
place because as long as Garuda was present, Vasuki could not come there.
