<h2>Text</h2>
vipralabdho dadamiti
tvayaham cadhya-manina
tad vyalika-phalam bhunksva

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vipralabdhah--now I am cheated; dadami--I promise I shall give you; iti--thus; tvaya--by you; aham--I
am; ca--also; adhya-manina--by being very proud of your opulence; tat--therefore; vyalika-phalam--as a
result of cheating; bhunksva--you enjoy; nirayam--in hellish life; katicit--a few; samah--years.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being falsely proud of your possessions, you promised to give Me land, but you could not fulfill your
promise. Therefore, because your promise was false, you must live for a few years in hellish life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The false prestige of thinking "I am very rich, and I possess such vast property" is another side of
material life. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else possesses
anything. This is the real fact. Isavasyam idam samam yat kinca jagatyam jagat. Bali Maharaja was
undoubtedly the most exalted devotee, whereas previously he had maintained a misunderstanding due to
false prestige. By the supreme will of the Lord, he now had to go to the hellish planets, but because he
went there by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he lived there more opulently than one
could expect to live in the planets of heaven. A devotee always lives with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, engaging in His service, and therefore he is always transcendental to hellish or heavenly
residences.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Twenty-first Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Bali Maharaja Arrested by the Lord"
Chapter Twenty-two
Bali Maharaja Surrenders His Life
The summary of this Twenty-second Chapter is as follows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead was
pleased by the behavior of Bali Maharaja. Thus the Lord placed him on the planet Sutala, and there, after
bestowing benedictions upon him, the Lord agreed to become his doorman.
Bali Maharaja was extremely truthful. Being unable to keep his promise, he was very much afraid, for he
knew that one who has deviated from truthfulness is insignificant in the eyes of society. An exalted person
can suffer the consequences of hellish life, but he is very much afraid of being defamed for deviation from
the truth. Bali Maharaja agreed with great pleasure to accept the punishment awarded him by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bali Maharaja's dynasty there were many asuras who because of their
enmity toward Visnu had achieved a destination more exalted than that of many mystic yogis. Bali
Maharaja specifically remembered the determination of Prahlada Maharaja in devotional service.
Considering all these points, he decided to give his head in charity as the place for Visnu's third step. Bali
Maharaja also considered how great personalities give up their family relationships and material
possessions to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, they sometimes even sacrifice their
lives for the satisfaction of the Lord, just to become His personal servants. Accordingly, by following in
the footsteps of previous acaryas and devotees, Bali Maharaja perceived himself successful.
While Bali Maharaja, having been arrested by the ropes of Varuna, was offering prayers to the Lord, his
grandfather Prahlada Maharaja appeared there and described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead
had delivered Bali Maharaja by taking his possessions in a tricky way. While Prahlada Maharaja was
present, Lord Brahma and Bali's wife, Vindhyavali, described the supremacy of the Supreme Lord. Since
Bali Maharaja had given everything to the Lord, they prayed for his release. The Lord then described how
a nondevotee's possession of wealth is a danger whereas a devotee's opulence is a benediction from the
Lord. Then, being pleased with Bali Maharaja, the Supreme Lord offered His disc to protect Bali Maharaja
and promised to remain with him.
