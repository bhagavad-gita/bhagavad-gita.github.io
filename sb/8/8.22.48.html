<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious
activities. Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes
purified when treated with fire. May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our
spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one's existence. Tapo divyam putraka yena
sattvam suddhyet. Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle
of birth and death (karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu). Therefore the purpose of human life
is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this
cycle of birth and death. The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord.
There are various processes for self-realization, such as karma, jnana and yoga, but none of them is equal
to the process of devotional service. As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being
put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by
performing devotional service (yat-sevaya), but not by karma, jnana or yoga. Cultivation of speculative
knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful.
The word varnam refers to the luster of one's original identity. The original luster of gold or silver is
brilliant. Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, is the
luster of ananda, or pleasure. Anandamayo bhyasat. Every living entity has the right to become
anandamaya, joyful, because he is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Krsna. Why should the living being
be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity
should become purified and regain his svarupa, his original identity. This he can do only by devotional
service. Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
described here as guror guruh, the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.
Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord's
representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it
is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore gives a definition of
guru. Yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa: the bona fide guru is he who advises his disciples exactly in
accordance with the principles spoken by Krsna. The bona fide guru is he who has accepted Krsna as
guru. This is the guru-parampara system. The original guru is Vyasadeva because he is the speaker of
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, wherein everything spoken relates to Krsna. Therefore guru-puja
is known as Vyasa-puja. In the final analysis, the original guru is Krsna, His disciple is Narada, whose
disciple is Vyasa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the guru-parampara. One cannot
become a guru if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead Krsna or His incarnation wants. The
mission of the guru is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread Krsna consciousness
all over the world.
