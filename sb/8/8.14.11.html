<h2>Translation</h2>
In one kalpa, or one day of Brahma, there take place the many changes called vikalpas. O King, all of
these have been previously described to you by me. Learned scholars who know the past, present and
future have ascertained that in one day of Brahma there are fourteen Manus.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Eighth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The System of Universal Management."
Chapter Fifteen
Bali Maharaja Conquers the Heavenly Planets
This chapter describes how Bali, after performing the Visvajit-yajna, received the benediction of a
chariot and various kinds of paraphernalia for war, with which he attacked the King of heaven. All the
demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planets and went away, following the instructions of their
guru.
Maharaja Pariksit wanted to understand how Lord Vamanadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of
land from Bali Maharaja, took everything away from him and arrested him. Sukadeva Gosvami responded
to this inquiry with the following explanation. In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as
described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the
grace of Sukracarya he regained his life. Thus he engaged himself in the service of Sukracarya, his spiritual
master. The descendants of Bhrgu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Visvajit-yajna. When this
yajna was performed, from the fire of yajna came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of
arrows. Maharaja Prahlada, Bali Maharaja's grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and
Sukracarya gave him a conchshell. Bali Maharaja, after offering obeisances to Prahlada, the brahmanas and
his spiritual master, Sukracarya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapuri with his
soldiers. Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra's kingdom. When Indra saw Bali
Maharaja's prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, Brhaspati, told him about Bali's strength, and
inquired about his duty. Brhaspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with
extraordinary power by the brahmanas, the demigods could not fight with him. Their only hope was to
gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, there was no alternative. Under the
circumstances, Brhaspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves
somewhere invisible. The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Maharaja, along with his associates,
gained the entire kingdom of Indra. The descendants of Bhrgu Muni, being very affectionate to their
disciple Bali Maharaja, engaged him in performing one hundred asvamedha-yajnas. In this way, Bali
enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets.
