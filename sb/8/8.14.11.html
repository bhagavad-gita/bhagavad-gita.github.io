<h2>Text</h2>
sri-aditir uvaca
bhadram dvija-gavam brahman
dharmasyasya janasya ca
tri-vargasya param ksetram
grhamedhin grha ime
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-aditih uvaca--Srimati Aditi said; bhadram--all auspiciousness; dvija-gavam--of the brahmanas and the
cows; brahman--O brahmana; dharmasya asya--of the religious principles mentioned in sastra; janasya--of
the people in general; ca--and; tri-vargasya--of the three processes of elevation (dharma, artha and kama);
param--the supreme; ksetram--field; grhamedhin--O my husband, who are attached to household life;
grhah--your home; ime--all these things.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Aditi said: O my respected brahmana husband, all is well with the brahmanas, the cows, religion and the
welfare of other people. O master of the house, the three principles of dharma, artha and kama flourish in
household life, which is consequently full of good fortune.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In household life one can develop the three principles of religion, economic development and sense
gratification according to the regulations given in the sastras, but to attain liberation one must give up
household life and place himself in the transcendental renounced order. Kasyapa Muni was not in the
renounced order of life. Therefore he is addressed here once as brahman and another time as grhamedhin.
Aditi, his wife, assured him that as far as household life was concerned, everything was going nicely, and
the brahmanas and cows were being honored and protected. In other words, there were no disturbances;
household life was duly progressing.
