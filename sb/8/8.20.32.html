adhyastam--go live there and occupy the place; visvakarma-vinirmitam--which is especially created by
Visvakarma; yat--wherein; adhayah--miseries pertaining to the mind; vyadhayah--miseries pertaining to

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Until Bali Maharaja achieves the position of King of heaven, he shall live on the planet Sutala, which
was made by Visvakarma according to My order. Because it is especially protected by Me, it is free from
mental and bodily miseries, fatigue, dizziness, defeat and all other disturbances. Bali Maharaja, you may
now go live there peacefully.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Visvakarma is the engineer or architect for the palatial buildings in the heavenly planets. Therefore,
since he was engaged to construct the residential quarters of Bali Maharaja, the buildings and palaces on
the planet Sutala must at least equal those on the heavenly planets. A further advantage of this place
designed for Bali Maharaja was that he would not be disturbed by any outward calamity. Moreover, he
would not be disturbed by mental or bodily miseries. These are all extraordinary features of the planet
Sutala, where Bali Maharaja would live.
In the Vedic literatures we find descriptions of many different planets where there are many, many
palaces, hundreds and thousands of times better than those of which we have experience on this planet
earth. When we speak of palaces, this naturally includes the idea of great cities and towns. Unfortunately,
when modern scientists try to explore other planets they see nothing but rocks and sand. Of course, they
may go on their frivolous excursions, but the students of the Vedic literature will never believe them or
give them any credit for exploring other planets.
