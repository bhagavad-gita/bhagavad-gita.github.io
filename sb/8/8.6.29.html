TRANSLATION
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness [suddha-sattva], and therefore He is
eka-varna--the omkara [pranava]. Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is
considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes. Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by
time or space, but is present everywhere. Seated on His carrier, Garuda, He is worshiped by means of
mystical yogic power by those who have achieved freedom from agitation. Let us all offer our respectful
obeisances unto Him.
PURPORT
Sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam (Bhag. 4.3.23). In this material world, the three modes of
material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--prevail. Among these three, goodness is the platform
of knowledge, and passion brings about a mixture of knowledge and ignorance, but the mode of
ignorance is full of darkness. Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond darkness and
passion. He is on the platform where goodness or knowledge is not disturbed by passion and ignorance.
This is called the vasudeva platform. It is on this platform of vasudeva that Vasudeva, or Krsna, can
appear. Thus Krsna appeared on this planet as the son of Vasudeva. Because the Lord is situated beyond
the three modes of material nature, He is unseen by those who are dominated by these three modes. One
must therefore become dhira, or undisturbed by the modes of material nature. The process of yoga may be
practiced by one who is free from the agitation of these modes. Therefore yoga is defined in this way: yoga
indriya-samyamah. As previously explained, we are disturbed by the indriyas, or senses. Moreover, we are
agitated by the three modes of material nature, which are imposed upon us by the external energy. In
conditional life, the living entity moves turbulently in the whirlpool of birth and death, but when one is
situated on the transcendental platform of visuddha-sattva, pure goodness, he can see the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who sits on the back of Garuda. Lord Brahma offers his respectful obeisances
unto that Supreme Lord.
