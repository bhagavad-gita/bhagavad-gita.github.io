api vakusalam kincid

dharmasyarthasya kamasya

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
api--I am wondering; va--either; akusalam--inauspiciousness; kincit--some; grhesu--at home; grhamedhini--
O my wife, who are attached to household life; dharmasya--of the principles of religion;
arthasya--of the economic condition; kamasya--of satisfaction of desires; yatra--at home; yogah--the result
of meditation; hi--indeed; ayoginam--even of those who are not transcendentalists.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my wife, who are very much attached to household life, if the principles of religion, economic
development and satisfaction of the senses are properly followed in household life, one's activities are as
good as those of a transcendentalist. I wonder whether there have been any discrepancies in following
these principles.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Kasyapa Muni, as grha-medhini, which means
"one who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification." Generally, those who are in household life
pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results. Such grhamedhis have
only one aim in life--sense gratification. Therefore it is said, yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi
tuccham: the householder's life is based on sense gratification, and therefore the happiness derived from it
is very meager. Nonetheless, the Vedic process is so comprehensive that even in householder life one can
adjust his activities according to the regulative principles of dharma, artha, kama and moksa. One's aim
should be to achieve liberation, but because one cannot at once give up sense gratification, in the sastras
there are injunctions prescribing how to follow the principles of religion, economic development and
sense gratification. As explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.9), dharmasya hy apavargyasya nartho
'rthayopakalpate: "All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should
never be performed for material gain." Those who are in household life should not think that religion is
meant to improve the process of the householder's sense gratification. Household life is also meant for
advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material
clutches. One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life
(tattva jijnasa). Then household life is as good as the life of a yogi. Kasyapa Muni therefore inquired from
his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being
properly followed in terms of the sastric injunctions. As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the
sastra, the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion.
