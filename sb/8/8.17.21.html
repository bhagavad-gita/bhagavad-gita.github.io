sri-bhagavan uvaca
yavanto visayah presthas
tri-lokyam ajitendriyam
na saknuvanti te sarve

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; yavantah--as far as possible; visayah--the
objects of sense enjoyment; presthah--pleasing to anyone; tri-lokyam--within these three worlds; ajitaindriyam--
a person who is not self-controlled; na saknuvanti--are unable; te--all those; sarve--taken
together; pratipurayitum--to satisfy; nrpa--O King.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead said: O my dear King, even the entirety of whatever there may be within the
three worlds to satisfy one's senses cannot satisfy a person whose senses are uncontrolled.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world is an illusory energy to deviate the living entities from the path of self-realization.
Anyone who is in this material world is extremely anxious to get more and more things for sense
gratification. Actually, however, the purpose of life is not sense gratification but self-realization.
Therefore, those who are too addicted to sense gratification are advised to practice the mystic yoga
system, or astanga-yoga system, consisting of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara and so on. In
this way, one can control the senses. The purpose of controlling the senses is to stop one's implication in
the cycle of birth and death. As stated by Rsabhadeva:
nunam pramattah kurute vikarma
yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti
na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam
asann api klesada asa dehah
"When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after
materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past
misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually
the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for
sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the
activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another." (Bhag.
5.5.4) Thus according to Rsabhadeva the human beings in this material world are just like madmen
engaged in activities which they should not perform but which they do perform only for sense
gratification. Such activities are not good because in this way one creates another body for his next life, as
punishment for his nefarious activities. And as soon as he gets another material body, he is put into
repeated suffering in material existence. Therefore the Vedic culture or brahminical culture teaches one
how to be satisfied with possessing the minimum necessities in life.
To teach this highest culture, varnasrama-dharma is recommended. The aim of the varnasrama
divisions--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa--is to train
one to control the senses and be content with the bare necessities. Here Lord Vamanadeva, as an ideal
brahmacari, refuses Bali Maharaja's offer to give Him anything He might want. He says that without
contentment one could not be happy even if he possessed the property of the entire world or the entire
universe. In human society, therefore, the brahminical culture, ksatriya culture and vaisya culture must be
maintained, and people must be taught how to be satisfied with only what they need. In modern
civilization there is no such education; everyone tries to possess more and more, and everyone is
dissatisfied and unhappy. The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore establishing various farms,
especially in America, to show how to be happy and content with minimum necessities of life and to save
time for self-realization, which one can very easily achieve by chanting the maha-mantra--Hare Krsna,
Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
