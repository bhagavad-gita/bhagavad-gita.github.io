<h2>Text</h2>
na vayam tvamarair daityaih
siddha-gandharva-caranaih
nasprsta-purvam janimo
lokesais ca kuto nrbhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--it is not; vayam--we; tva--unto You; amaraih--by the demigods; daityaih--by the demons; siddha--by
the Siddhas; gandharva--by the Gandharvas; caranaih--and by the Caranas; na--not; asprsta-purvam--
never enjoyed or touched by anyone; janimah--know exactly; loka-isaih--by the various directors of the
universe; ca--also; kutah--what to speak of; nrbhih--by human society.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What to speak of human beings, even the demigods, demons, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Caranas and the
various directors of the universe, the Prajapatis, have never touched You before. It is not that we are
unable to understand Your identity.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even the asuras observed the etiquette that no one should address a married woman with lust. The great
analyst Canakya Pandita says, matrvat para-daresu: one should consider another's wife to be one's mother.
The asuras, the demons, took it for granted that the beautiful young woman, Mohini-murti, who had
arrived before them, was certainly not married. Therefore they assumed that no one in the world,
including the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Caranas and the Siddhas, had ever touched Her. The
demons knew that the young girl was unmarried, and therefore they dared to address Her. They supposed
that the young girl, Mohini-murti, had come there to find a husband among all those present (the Daityas,
the demigods, the Gandharvas and so on).
