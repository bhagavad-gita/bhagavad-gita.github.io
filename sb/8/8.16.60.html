<h2>Text</h2>
ayam vai sarva-yajnakhyah
sarva-vratam iti smrtam
tapah-saram idam bhadre
danam cesvara-tarpanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ayam--this; vai--indeed; sarva-yajna--all kinds of religious rituals and sacrifices; akhyah--called; sarvavratam--
all religious ceremonies; iti--thus; smrtam--understood; tapah-saram--the essence of all
austerities; idam--this; bhadre--O good lady; danam--acts of charity; ca--and; isvara--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; tarpanam--the process of pleasing.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This payo-vrata is also known as sarva-yajna. In other words, by performing this sacrifice one can
perform all other sacrifices automatically. This is also acknowledged to be the best of all ritualistic
ceremonies. O gentle lady, it is the essence of all austerities, and it is the process of giving charity and
pleasing the supreme controller.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Aradhananam sarvesam visnor aradhanam param. This is a statement made by Lord Siva to Parvati.
Worshiping Lord Visnu is the supreme process of worship. And how Lord Visnu is worshiped in this
payo-vrata ceremony has now been fully described. The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Visnu by
varnasrama-dharma. The Vedic principles of four varnas and four asramas are meant for worship of Visnu
(visnur aradhyate pumsam nanyat tat-tosa-karanam). The Krsna consciousness movement is also visnuaradhanam,
or worship of Lord Visnu, according to the age. The payo-vrata method of visnu-aradhanam
was enunciated long, long ago by Kasyapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same
process is bona fide on earth even now. Especially for this age of Kali, the process accepted by the Krsna
consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Visnu temples (temples of Radha-Krsna,
Jagannatha, Balarama, Sita-Rama, Gaura-Nitai and so on). Performing prescribed worship in such temples
of Visnu and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the payo-vrata ceremony recommended
here. The payo-vrata ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of
the moon, but in our Krsna consciousness movement Lord Visnu is worshiped in every temple according
to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing kirtana, chanting the Hare Krsna mahamantra,
offering palatable food to Lord Visnu and distributing this food to Vaisnavas and others. These
are authorized activities, and if the members of the Krsna consciousness movement stick to these
principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the payo-vrata ceremony. Thus the
essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing yajna, giving in charity, observing vratas, and
undergoing austerities, is included in the Krsna consciousness movement. The members of this movement
should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended. Of course, sacrifice is
meant to please Lord Visnu. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: in Kali-yuga, those who
are intelligent perform the sankirtana-yajna. One should follow this process conscientiously.
