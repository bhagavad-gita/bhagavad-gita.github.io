<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
namah santaya ghoraya
mudhaya guna-dharmine
nirvisesaya samyaya
namo jnana-ghanaya ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
namah--all obeisances; santaya--unto He who is above all material qualities and completely peaceful, or
unto Vasudeva, the Supersoul in every living entity; ghoraya--unto the fierce forms of the Lord like
Jamadagnya and Nrsimhadeva; mudhaya--the form of the Lord as an animal, such as the boar; gunadharmine--
who accepts different qualities within the material world; nirvisesaya--who is without material
qualities, being fully spiritual; samyaya--Lord Buddha, the form of nirvana, wherein the material qualities
stop; namah--I offer my respectful obeisances; jnana-ghanaya--who is knowledge or the impersonal
Brahman; ca--also.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Vasudeva, who is all-pervading, to the Lord's fierce form as
Lord Nrsimhadeva, to the Lord's form as an animal [Lord Varahadeva], to Lord Dattatreya, who preached
impersonalism, to Lord Buddha, and to all the other incarnations. I offer my respectful obeisances unto
the Lord, who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities goodness, passion and
ignorance within this material world. I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman
effulgence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verses it has been described that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no
material form, He accepts innumerable forms to favor His devotees and kill the demons. As stated in
Srimad-Bhagavatam, there are so many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that they are
like the waves of a river. The waves of a river flow incessantly, and no one can count how many waves
there are. Similarly, no one can calculate when and how the different incarnations of the Lord appear
according to the necessities of time, place and candidates. The Lord appears perpetually. As Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." In the material world there is always the
possibility of deviation from Krsna consciousness, and therefore Krsna and His devotees always act in
various forms to curb such godlessness.
Even impersonalists who stress the knowledge feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead want to
merge in the effulgence of the Lord. Therefore, here the word jnana-ghanaya indicates that for atheists
who disbelieve in the form and existence of the Lord, all these various incarnations appear. Since the Lord
comes to teach in so many forms, no one can say that there is no God. The word jnana-ghanaya is
especially used here to refer to those whose knowledge has become solidified by dint of their searching for
the Lord through speculative philosophical understanding. Superficial knowledge is useless for
understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one's knowledge becomes extremely
intense and deep, one understands Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah). A jnani
attains this stage after many, many births. Therefore the word jnana-ghanaya is used here. The word
santaya indicates that Lord Vasudeva is situated in everyone's heart but does not act with the living entity.
Impersonalist jnanis realize Vasudeva when they are fully mature in knowledge (vasudevah samam iti sa
mahatma sudurlabhah).
