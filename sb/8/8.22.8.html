citram tavehitam aho 'mita-yogamayalila-
visrsta-bhuvanasya visaradasya
sarvatmanah samadrso 'visamah svabhavo
bhakta-priyo yad asi kalpataru-svabhavah
SYNONYMS
citram--very wonderful; tava ihitam--all Your activities; aho--alas; amita--unlimited; yogamaya--of Your
spiritual potency; lila--by the pastimes; visrsta-bhuvanasya--of Your Lordship, by whom all the universes
have been created; visaradasya--of Your Lordship, who are expert in all respects; sarva-atmanah--of Your
Lordship, who pervade all; sama-drsah--and who are equal toward all; avisamah--without differentiation;
svabhavah--that is Your characteristic; bhakta-priyah--under the circumstances You become favorable to
the devotees; yat--because; asi--You are; kalpataru-svabhavah--having the characteristic of a desire tree.
TRANSLATION
O my Lord, Your pastimes are all wonderfully performed by Your inconceivable spiritual energy; and by
her perverted reflection, the material energy, You have created all the universes. As the Supersoul of all
living entities, You are aware of everything, and therefore You are certainly equal toward everyone.
Nonetheless, You favor Your devotees. This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like
that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one's desire.
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):
samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham
"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in
devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him." The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
certainly equal toward all living entities, but a devotee who fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord is
different from a nondevotee. In other words, everyone can take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord to
enjoy equal benedictions from the Lord, but nondevotees do not do so, and therefore they suffer the
consequences created by the material energy. We can understand this fact by a simple example. The king
or government is equal to all citizens. Therefore, if a citizen capable of receiving special favors from the
government is offered such favors, this does not mean that the government is partial. One who knows
how to receive favors from the authority can receive them, but one who does not neglects these favors and
does not receive them. There are two classes of men--the demons and the demigods. The demigods are
fully aware of the Supreme Lord's position, and therefore they are obedient to Him, but even if demons
know about the supremacy of the Lord they purposely defy His authority. Therefore, the Lord makes
distinctions according to the mentality of the living being, but otherwise He is equal to everyone. Like a
desire tree, the Lord fulfills the desires of one who takes shelter of Him, but one who does not take such
shelter is distinct from the surrendered soul. One who takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is favored
by the Lord, regardless of whether such a person is a demon or a demigod.
