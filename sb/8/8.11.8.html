<h2>Text</h2>
tad idam kala-rasanam
jagat pasyanti surayah
na hrsyanti na socanti
tatra yuyam apanditah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; idam--this whole material world; kala-rasanam--is moving because of time eternal; jagat--
moving forward (this whole universe); pasyanti--observe; surayah--those who are intelligent by admission
of the truth; na--not; hrsyanti--become jubilant; na--nor; socanti--lament; tatra--in such; yuyam--all of you
demigods; apanditah--not very learned (having forgotten that you are working under eternal time).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Seeing the movements of time, those who are cognizant of the real truth neither rejoice nor lament for
different circumstances. Therefore, because you are jubilant due to your victory, you should be
considered not very learned.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bali Maharaja knew that Indra, King of heaven, was extremely powerful, certainly more powerful than
he himself. Nonetheless, Bali Maharaja challenged Indra by saying that Indra was not a very learned
person. In Bhagavad-gita (2.11) Krsna rebuked Arjuna by saying:
asocyan anvasocas tvam
prajna-vadams ca bhasase
gatasun agatasums ca
nanusocanti panditah
"While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise
lament neither for the living nor the dead." Thus as Krsna challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a
pandita, or a learned person, Bali Maharaja also challenged King Indra and his associates. In this material
world, everything happens under the influence of time. Consequently, for a learned person who sees how
things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material
nature. After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or
morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of
nature's activities. In Bhagavad-gita (2.14), Krsna advises that one be tolerant: tams titiksasva bharata.
Following this advice of Krsna's, one should not be morose or unhappy because of circumstantial
changes. This is the symptom of a devotee. A devotee carries out his duty in Krsna consciousness and is
never unhappy in awkward circumstances. He has full faith that in such circumstances, Krsna protects His
devotee. Therefore a devotee never deviates from his prescribed duty of devotional service. The material
qualities of jubilation and moroseness are present even in the demigods, who are very highly situated in
the upper planetary system. Therefore, when one is undisturbed by the so-called favorable and
unfavorable circumstances of this material world, he should be understood to be brahma-bhuta, or selfrealized.
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.54), brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati: "One
who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful." When
one is undisturbed by material circumstances, he should be understood to be on the transcendental stage,
above the reactions of the three modes of material nature.
