<h2>Text</h2>
ekas tvam eva sad asad dvayam advayam ca
svarnam krtakrtam iveha na vastu-bhedah
ajnanatas tvayi janair vihito vikalpo
yasmad guna-vyatikaro nirupadhikasya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekah--the only one; tvam--Your Lordship; eva--indeed; sat--which is existing, as the effect; asat--which
is nonexistent, as the cause; dvayam--both of them; advayam--without duality; ca--and; svarnam--gold;
krta--manufactured into different forms; akrtam--the original source of gold (the gold mine); iva--like;
iha--in this world; na--not; vastu-bhedah--difference in the substance; ajnanatah--only because of
ignorance; tvayi--unto You; janaih--by the general mass of people; vihitah--it should be done; vikalpah--
differentiation; yasmat--because of; guna-vyatikarah--free from the differences created by the material
modes of nature; nirupadhikasya--without any material designation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, Your Lordship alone is the cause and the effect. Therefore, although You appear to be
two, You are the absolute one. As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the
gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same. Only because
of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities. You are free from material contamination, and
since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your
transcendental qualities. Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be
maintained.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the living entities are representations of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead's marginal potency whereas the various bodies accepted by the living entities are
products of the material energy. Thus the body is considered material, and the soul is considered spiritual.
The origin of them both, however, is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. As the Lord explains in
Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5):
bhumir apo 'nalo vayuh
kham mano buddhir eva ca
ahankara itiyam me
bhinna prakrtir astadha
apareyam itas tv anyam
prakrtim viddhi me param
jiva-bhutam maha-baho
yayedam dharyate jagat
"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--all together these eight comprise My
separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior
energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are
sustaining the universe." Thus both matter and the living entities are manifestations of energy of the
Supreme Lord. Since the energy and the energetic are not different and since the material and marginal
energies are both energies of the supreme energetic, the Supreme Lord, ultimately the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is everything. In this regard, the example may be given of gold that has not been
molded and gold that has been molded into various ornaments. A gold earring and the gold in a mine are
different only as cause and effect; otherwise they are the same. The Vedanta-sutra describes that Brahman
is the cause of everything. Janmady asya yatah. Everything is born of the Supreme Brahman, from which
everything emanates as different energies. None of these energies, therefore, should be considered false.
The Mayavadis' differentiation between Brahman and maya is only due to ignorance.
Srimad Viraraghava Acarya, in his Bhagavata-candra-candrika, describes the Vaisnava philosophy as
follows. The cosmic manifestation is described as sat and asat, as cit and acit. Matter is acit, and the living
force is cit, but their origin is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in whom there is no difference
between matter and spirit. According to this conception, the cosmic manifestation, consisting of both
matter and spirit, is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Idam hi visvam bhagavan
ivetarah: "This cosmic manifestation is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears
different from Him." In Bhagavad-gita (9.4) the Lord says:
maya tatam idam sarvam
jagad avyakta-murtina
mat-sthani sarva-bhutani
na caham tesv avasthitah
"By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in
them." Thus although someone may say that the Supreme Person is different from the cosmic
manifestation, actually He is not. The Lord says, maya tatam idam sarvam: "In My impersonal feature I am
spread throughout the world." Therefore, this world is not different from Him. The difference is a
difference in names. For example, whether we speak of gold earrings, gold bangles or gold necklaces,
ultimately they are all gold. In a similar way, all the different manifestations of matter and spirit are
ultimately one in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. ekam evadvitiyam brahma. This is the Vedic
version (Chandogya Upanisad 6.2.1). There is oneness because everything emanates from the Supreme
Brahman. The example already given is that there is no difference between a golden earring and the gold
mine as it is. The Vaisesika philosophers, however, because of their Mayavada conception, create
differences. They say, brahma satyam jagan mithya: "The Absolute Truth is real, and the cosmic
manifestation is false." But why should the jagat be considered mithya? The jagat is an emanation from
Brahman. Therefore the jagat is also truth.
Vaisnavas, therefore, do not consider the jagat to be mithya; rather, they regard everything as reality in
connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayunjatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktam vairagyam ucyate
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
"Things should be accepted for the Lord's service and not for one's personal sense gratification. If one
accepts something without attachment and accepts it because it is related to Krsna, one's renunciation is
called yuktam vairagyam. Whatever is favorable for the rendering of service to the Lord should be
accepted and should not be rejected as a material thing." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255-256) The jagat
should not be rejected as mithya. It is truth, and the truth is realized when everything is engaged in the
service of the Lord. A flower accepted for one's sense gratification is material, but when the same flower is
offered to the Supreme personality of Godhead by a devotee, it is spiritual. Food taken and cooked for
oneself is material, but food cooked for the Supreme Lord is spiritual prasada. This is a question of
realization. Actually, everything is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore everything
is spiritual, but those who are not advanced in proper knowledge make distinctions because of the
interactions of the three modes of material nature. In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami says that although the
sun is the only light, the sunshine, which is exhibited in seven colors, and darkness, which is the absence
of sunshine, are not different from the sun, for without the existence of the sun such differentiations
cannot exist. There may be varied nomenclature because of different conditions, but they are all the sun.
The puranas therefore say:
eka-desa-sthitasyagner
jyotsna vistarini yatha
parasya brahmanah saktis
tathedam akhilam jagat
"Just as the illumination of a fire, which is situated in one place, is spread all over, the energies of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman, are spread all over this universe." (Visnu Purana 1.22.53)
Materially, we can directly perceive the sunshine spreading itself according to different names and
activities, but ultimately the sun is one. Similarly, sarvam khalv idam brahma: everything is an expansion
of the Supreme Brahman. Therefore, the Supreme Lord is everything, and He is one without
differentiation. There is no existence separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
