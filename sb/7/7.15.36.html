<h2>Text</h2>
yah pravrajya grhat purvam
tri-vargavapanat punah
yadi seveta tan bhiksuh
sa vai vantasy apatrapah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--one who; pravrajya--being finished for good and leaving for the forest (being situated in
transcendental bliss); grhat--from home; purvam--at first; tri-varga--the three principles of religion,
economic development and sense gratification; avapanat--from the field in which they are sown; punah--
again; yadi--if; seveta--should accept; tan--materialistic activities; bhiksuh--a person who has accepted the
sannyasa order; sah--that person; vai--indeed; vanta-asi--one who eats his own vomit; apatrapah--without
shame.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who accepts the sannyasa order gives up the three principles of materialistic activities in which one
indulges in the field of household life--namely religion, economic development and sense gratification.
One who first accepts sannyasa but then returns to such materialistic activities is to be called a vantasi, or
one who eats his own vomit. He is indeed a shameless person.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialistic activities are regulated by the institution of varnasrama-dharma. Without varnasramadharma,
materialistic activities constitute animal life. Yet even in human life, while observing the
principles of varna and asrama--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha
and sannyasa--one must ultimately accept sannyasa, the renounced order, for only by the renounced order
can one be situated in brahma-sukha, or transcendental bliss. In brahma-sukha one is no longer attracted
by lusty desires. Indeed, when one is no longer disturbed, especially by lusty desires for sexual
indulgence, he is fit to become a sannyasi. Otherwise, one should not accept the sannyasa order. If one
accepts sannyasa at an immature stage, there is every possibility of his being attracted by women and lusty
desires and thus again becoming a so-called grhastha or a victim of women. Such a person is most
shameless, and he is called vantasi, or one who eats that which he has already vomited. He certainly leads
a condemned life. In our Krsna consciousness movement it is advised, therefore, that the sannyasis and
brahmacaris keep strictly aloof from the association of women so that there will be no chance of their
falling down again as victims of lusty desires.
