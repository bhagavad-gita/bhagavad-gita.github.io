<h2>Text</h2>
ya patim hari-bhavena
bhajet srir iva tat-para
hary-atmana harer loke
patya srir iva modate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ya--any woman who; patim--her husband; hari-bhavena--mentally accepting him as equal to Hari, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhajet--worships or renders service to; srih iva--exactly like the goddess
of fortune; tat-para--being devoted; hari-atmana--completely absorbed in thoughts of Hari; hareh loke--in
the spiritual world, the Vaikuntha planets; patya--with her husband; srih iva--exactly like the goddess of
fortune; modate--enjoys spiritual, eternal life.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The woman who engages in the service of her husband, following strictly in the footsteps of the goddess
of fortune, surely returns home, back to Godhead, with her devotee husband, and lives very happily in the
Vaikuntha planets.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The faithfulness of the goddess of fortune is the ideal for a chaste woman. The Brahma-samhita (5.29)
says, laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam. In the Vaikuntha planets, Lord Visnu is worshiped by
many, many thousands of goddesses of fortune, and in Goloka Vrndavana, Lord Krsna is worshiped by
many, many thousands of gopis, all of whom are goddesses of fortune. A woman should serve her
husband as faithfully as the goddess of fortune. A man should be an ideal servant of the Lord, and a
woman should be an ideal wife like the goddess of fortune. Then both husband and wife will be so faithful
and strong that by acting together they will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt. In this
regard, Srila Madhvacarya gives this opinion:
harir asmin sthita iti
strinam bhartari bhavana
sisyanam ca gurau nityam
sudranam brahmanadisu
bhrtyanam svamini tatha
hari-bhava udiritah
A woman should think of her husband as the Supreme Lord. Similarly, a disciple should think of the
spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a sudra should think of a brahmana as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a servant should think of his master as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In this way, all of them will automatically become devotees of the Lord. In other words, by
thinking this way, all of them will become Krsna conscious.
