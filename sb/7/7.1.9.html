<h2>Text</h2>
jyotir-adir ivabhati
sanghatan na vivicyate
vidanty atmanam atma-stham
mathitva kavayo 'ntatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jyotih--fire; adih--and other elements; iva--just as; abhati--appear; sanghatat--from the bodies of
demigods and others; na--not; vivicyate--are distinguished; vidanti--perceive; atmanam--the Supersoul;
atma-stham--situated in the heart; mathitva--by discerning; kavayah--expert thinkers; antatah--within.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The all-pervading Personality of Godhead exists within the heart of every living being, and an expert
thinker can perceive how He is present there to a large or small extent. Just as one can understand the
supply of fire in wood, the water in a waterpot, or the sky within a pot, one can understand whether a
living entity is a demon or a demigod by understanding that living entity's devotional performances. A
thoughtful man can understand how much a person is favored by the Supreme Lord by seeing his actions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (10.41) the Lord says:
yad yad vibhutimat sattvam
srimad urjitam eva va
tat tad evavagaccha tvam
mama tejo-'msa-sambhavam
"Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor." We
have the practical experience of seeing that one person is able to do very wonderful things whereas
another cannot do those same things and cannot even do things that require only a little common sense.
Therefore, how much a devotee has been favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be tested by
the activities the devotee has performed. In Bhagavad-gita (10.10) the Lord also says:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by
which they can come to Me." This is very practical. A teacher instructs the student if the student is
capable of taking more and more instructions. Otherwise, in spite of being instructed by the teacher, the
student cannot make strides in his understanding. This has nothing to do with partiality. When Krsna
says tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatam priti-purvakam. dadami buddhi-yogam tam, this indicates that
Krsna is prepared to give bhakti-yoga to everyone, but one must be capable of receiving it. That is the
secret. Thus when a person exhibits wonderful devotional activities, a thoughtful man understands that
Krsna has been more favorable to this devotee.
This is not difficult to understand, but envious persons do not accept that Krsna has bestowed His favor
upon a particular devotee in accordance with his advanced position. Such foolish persons become envious
and try to minimize an advanced devotee's activities. That is not Vaisnavism. A Vaisnava should
appreciate the service rendered to the Lord by other Vaisnavas. Therefore a Vaisnava is described in
Srimad-Bhagavatam as nirmatsara. Vaisnavas are never envious of other Vaisnavas or of anyone else, and
therefore they are called nirmatsaranam satam.
As Bhagavad-gita informs us, one can understand how one is saturated with sattva-guna, rajo-guna or
tamo-guna. In the examples given herewith, fire represents the mode of goodness. One can understand
the constitution of a container for wood, petrol or other inflammable substances by the quantity of the
fire. Similarly, water represents rajo-guna, the mode of passion. A small skin and the vast Atlantic Ocean
both contain water, and by seeing the quantity of water in a container one can understand the size of the
container. The sky represents the mode of ignorance. The sky is present in a small earthen pot and also in
outer space. Thus by proper judgment one can see who is a devata, or demigod, and who is an asura,
Yaksa or Raksasa according to the quantities of sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. One cannot judge
whether a person is a devata, an asura or a Raksasa by seeing him, but a sane man can understand this by
the activities such a person performs. A general description is given in the padma purana: visnu-bhaktah
smrto daiva asuras tad-viparyayah. A devotee of Lord Visnu is a demigod, whereas an asura or Yaksa is
just the opposite. An asura is not a devotee of Lord Visnu; instead, for his sense gratification he is a
devotee of the demigods, bhutas, pretas and so on. Thus one can judge who is a devata, who is a Raksasa
and who is an asura by how they conduct their activities.
The word atmanam in this verse means paramatmanam. The Paramatma, or Supersoul, is situated in the
core of everyone's heart (antatah). This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.61). Isvarah sarva-bhutanam
hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati. The isvara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone's
heart, gives directions to everyone in terms of one's capabilities in taking the instructions. The
instructions of Bhagavad-gita are open to everyone, but some people understand them properly, whereas
others understand them so improperly that they cannot even believe in the existence of Krsna, although
reading Krsna's book. Although the Gita says sri-bhagavan uvaca, indicating that Krsna spoke, they
cannot understand Krsna. This is due to their misfortune or incapability, which is caused by rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, the modes of passion and ignorance. It is because of these modes that they cannot even
understand Krsna, whereas an advanced devotee like Arjuna understands Him and glorifies Him, saying,
param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan: "You are the Supreme Brahman, the supreme
abode and purifier." Krsna is open to everyone, but one needs the capability to understand Him.
By external features one cannot understand who is favored by Krsna and who is not. According to one's
attitude, Krsna becomes one's direct adviser, or Krsna becomes unknown. This is not Krsna's partiality; it
is His response to one's ability to understand Him. According to one's receptiveness--whether one be a
devata, asura, Yaksa or Raksasa--Krsna's quality is proportionately exhibited. This proportionate
exhibition of Krsna's power is misunderstood by less intelligent men to be Krsna's partiality, but actually
it is no such thing. Krsna is equal to everyone, and according to one's ability to receive the favor of Krsna,
one advances in Krsna consciousness. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives a practical example in
this connection. In the sky there are many luminaries. At night, even in darkness, the moon is extremely
brilliant and can be directly perceived. The sun is also extremely brilliant. When covered by clouds,
however, these luminaries are not distinctly visible. Similarly, the more one advances in sattva-guna, the
more his brilliance is exhibited by devotional service, but the more one is covered by rajo-guna and tamoguna,
the less visible his brilliance, for he is covered by these qualities. The visibility of one's qualities
does not depend on the partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; it is due to various coverings in
different proportions. Thus one can understand how far he has advanced in terms of sattva-guna and how
much he is covered by rajo-guna and tamo-guna.
