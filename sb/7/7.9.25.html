<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this material world, every living entity desires some future happiness, which is exactly like a mirage
in the desert. Where is water in the desert, or, in other words, where is happiness in this material world?
As for this body, what is its value? It is merely a source of various diseases. The so-called philosophers,
scientists and politicians know this very well, but nonetheless they aspire for temporary happiness.
Happiness is very difficult to obtain, but because they are unable to control their senses, they run after the
so-called happiness of the material world and never come to the right conclusion.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a song in the Bengali language which states, "I constructed this home for happiness, but
unfortunately there was a fire, and everything has now been burnt to ashes." This illustrates the nature of
material happiness. Everyone knows it, but nonetheless one plans to hear or think something very
pleasing. Unfortunately, all of one's plans are annihilated in due course of time. There were many
politicians who planned empires, supremacy and control of the world, but in due time all their plans and
empires--and even the politicians themselves--were vanquished. Everyone should take lessons from
Prahlada Maharaja about how we are engaged in so-called temporary happiness through bodily exercises
for sense enjoyment. All of us repeatedly make plans, which are all repeatedly frustrated. Therefore one
should stop such planmaking.
As one cannot stop a blazing fire by constantly pouring ghee upon it, one cannot satisfy oneself by
increasing plans for sense enjoyment. The blazing fire is bhava-maha-davagni, the forest fire of material
existence. This forest fire occurs automatically, without endeavor. We want to be happy in the material
world, but this will never be possible; we shall simply increase the blazing fire of desires. Our desires
cannot be satisfied by illusory thoughts and plans; rather, we have to follow the instructions of Lord
Krsna: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. Then we shall be happy. Otherwise, in the
name of happiness, we shall continue to suffer miserable conditions.
