khe khani vayau nisvasams
tejahsusmanam atmavan
apsv asrk-slesma-puyani
ksitau sesam yathodbhavam
SYNONYMS
khe--in the sky; khani--all the holes of the body; vayau--in the air; nisvasan--all the different airs moving
within the body (prana, apana, etc.); tejahsu--in fire; usmanam--the heat of the body; atma-van--a person
who knows the self; apsu--in water; asrk--blood; slesma--mucus; puyani--and urine; ksitau--in the earth;
sesam--the remaining (namely skin, bones and the other hard things in the body); yatha-udbhavam--
wherefrom all of them grew.
TRANSLATION
A sober, self-realized person who has full knowledge should merge the various parts of the body in their
original sources. The holes in the body are caused by the sky, the process of breathing is caused by the air,
the heat of the body is caused by fire, and semen, blood and mucus are caused by water. The hard
substances, like skin, muscle and bone, are caused by earth. In this way all the constituents of the body
are caused by various elements, and they should be merged again into those elements.
PURPORT
To be self-realized, one must understand the original sources of the various elements of the body. The
body is a combination of skin, bone, muscle, blood, semen, urine, stool, heat, breath and so on, which all
come from earth, water, fire, air and sky. One must be well conversant with the sources of all the bodily
constituents. Then one becomes a self-realized person, or atmavan, one who knows the self.

The mind, along with all material desires, should be merged in the moon demigod. All the subject
matters of intelligence, along with the intelligence itself, should be placed in Lord Brahma. False ego,
which is under the influence of the material modes of nature and which induces one to think, "I am this
body, and everything connected with this body is mine," should be merged, along with material activities,
in Rudra, the predominating deity of false ego. Material consciousness, along with the goal of thought,
should be merged in the individual living being, and the demigods acting under the modes of material
nature should be merged, along with the perverted living being, into the Supreme Being. The earth should
be merged in water, water in the brightness of the sun, this brightness into the air, the air into the sky, the
sky into the false ego, the false ego into the total material energy, the total material energy into the
unmanifested ingredients [the pradhana feature of the material energy], and at last the ingredient feature
of material manifestation into the Supersoul.
