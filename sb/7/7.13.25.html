<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yadrcchaya--carried by the waves of material nature; lokam--human form; imam--this; prapitah--
achieved; karmabhih--by the influence of different fruitive activities; bhraman--wandering from one form
of life to another; svarga--to the heavenly planets; apavargayoh--to liberation; dvaram--the gate; tirascam--
lower species of life; punah--again; asya--of the human beings; ca--and.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the course of the evolutionary process, which is caused by fruitive activities due to undesirable
material sense gratification, I have received this human form of life, which can lead to the heavenly
planets, to liberation, to the lower species, or to rebirth among human beings.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All living entities within this material world are undergoing the cycle of birth and death according to the
laws of nature. This struggle of birth and death in different species may be called the evolutionary process,
but in the Western world it has been wrongly explained. Darwin's theory of evolution from animal to man
is incomplete because the theory does not present the reverse condition, namely evolution from man to
animal. In this verse, however, evolution has been very well explained on the strength of Vedic authority.
Human life, which is obtained in the course of the evolutionary process, is a chance for elevation
(svargapavarga) or for degradation (tirascam punar asya ca). If one uses this human form of life properly,
he can elevate himself to the higher planetary systems, where material happiness is many thousands of
times better than on this planet, or one may cultivate knowledge by which to become free from the
evolutionary process and be reinstated in one's original spiritual life. This is called apavarga, or liberation.
Material life is called pavarga because here we are subject to five different states of suffering, represented
by the letters pa, pha, ba, bha and ma. Pa means parisrama, very hard labor. Pha means phena, or foam
from the mouth. For example, sometimes we see a horse foaming at the mouth with heavy labor. Ba
means byarthata, disappointment. In spite of so much hard labor, at the end we find disappointment. Bha
means bhaya, or fear. In material life, one is always in the blazing fire of fear, since no one knows what
will happen next. Finally, ma means mrtyu, or death. When one attempts to nullify these five different
statuses of life--pa, pha, ba, bha and ma--one achieves apavarga, or liberation from the punishment of
material existence.
The word tirascam refers to degraded life. Human life, of course, provides an opportunity for the best
living conditions. As Western people think, from the monkeys come the human beings, who are more
comfortably situated. However, if one does not utilize his human life for svarga or apavarga, he falls again
to the degraded life of animals like dogs and hogs. Therefore a sane human being must consider whether
he will elevate himself to the higher planets, prepare to free himself from the evolutionary process, or
travel again through the evolutionary process in higher and lower grades of life. If one works piously one
may be elevated to the higher planetary systems or achieve liberation and return home, back to Godhead,
but otherwise one may be degraded to a life as a dog, a hog and so on. As explained in Bhagavad-gita
(9.25), yanti deva-vrata devan. Those interested in being elevated to the higher planetary systems
(Devaloka or Svargaloka) must prepare to do so. Similarly, if one wants liberation and wants to return
home, back to Godhead, he should prepare himself for that purpose.
Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore the highest movement for the benediction of human
society because this movement is teaching people how to go back home, back to Godhead. In Bhagavadgita
(13.22) it is clearly stated that different forms of life are obtained by association with the three modes
of material nature (karanam guna-sango 'sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu). According to one's association with
the material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance in this life, in one's next life one receives an
appropriate body. Modern civilization does not know that because of varied association in material
nature, the living entity, although eternal, is placed in different diseased conditions known as the many
species of life. Modern civilization is unaware of the laws of nature.
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself
the performer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27) Every living entity is
under the full control of the stringent laws of material nature, but rascals think themselves independent.
Actually, however, they cannot be independent. This is foolishness. A foolish civilization is extremely
risky, and therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is trying to make people aware of their fully
dependent condition under the stringent laws of nature and is trying to save them from being victimized
by strong maya, which is Krsna's external energy. Behind the material laws is the supreme controller,
Krsna (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram). Therefore if one surrenders unto Krsna (mam eva
ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te), one may immediately be freed from the control of external nature
(sa guna-n samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate). This should be the aim of life.
