<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with the living entity because of his devotional
service, one becomes a pandita and does not make distinctions between enemies, friends and himself.
Intelligently, he then thinks, "Every one of us is an eternal servant of God, and therefore we are not
different from one another."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Prahlada Maharaja's teachers and demoniac father asked him how his intelligence had been
polluted, Prahlada Maharaja said, "As far as I am concerned, my intelligence has not been polluted.
Rather, by the grace of my spiritual master and by the grace of my Lord, Krsna, I have now learned that no
one is my enemy and no one is my friend. We are all actually eternal servants of Krsna, but under the
influence of the external energy we think that we are separately situated from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as friends and enemies of one another. This mistaken idea has now been corrected, and
therefore, unlike ordinary human beings, I no longer think that I am God and that others are my friends
and enemies. Now I am rightly thinking that everyone is an eternal servant of God and that our duty is to
serve the supreme master, for then we shall stand on the platform of oneness as servants."
Demons think of everyone as a friend or enemy, but Vaisnavas say that since everyone is a servant of the
Lord, everyone is on the same platform. Therefore a Vaisnava treats other living entities neither as friends
nor as enemies, but instead tries to spread Krsna consciousness, teaching everyone that we are all one as
servants of the Supreme Lord but are uselessly wasting our valuable lives by creating nations,
communities and other groups of friends and enemies. Everyone should come to the platform of Krsna
consciousness and thus feel oneness as a servant of the Lord. Although there are 8,400,000 species of life,
a Vaisnava feels this oneness. The Isopanisad advises, ekatvam anupasyatah. A devotee should see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead to be situated in everyone's heart and should also see every living entity
as an eternal servant of the Lord. This vision is called ekatvam, oneness. Although there is a relationship
of master and servant, both master and servant are one because of their spiritual identity. This is also
ekatvam. Thus the conception of ekatvam for the Vaisnava is different from that of the Mayavadi.
Hiranyakasipu asked Prahlada Maharaja how he had become antagonistic to his family. When a family
member is killed by an enemy, all the members of the family would naturally be inimical to the murderer,
but Hiranyakasipu saw that Prahlada had become friendly with the murderer. Therefore he asked, "Who
has created this kind of intelligence in you? Have you developed this consciousness by yourself? Since
you are a small boy, someone must have induced you to think this way." Prahlada Maharaja wanted to
reply that an attitude favorable toward Visnu can develop only when the Lord is favorable (sa
yadanuvratah). As stated in Bhagavad-gita, Krsna is the friend of everyone (suhrdam sama-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati). The Lord is never an enemy to any of the millions of living entities, but is
always a friend to everyone. This is true understanding. If one thinks that the Lord is an enemy, his
intelligence is pasu-buddhi, the intelligence of an animal. He falsely thinks, "I am different from my
enemy, and my enemy is different from me. The enemy has done this, and therefore my duty is to kill
him." This misconception is described in this verse as bheda-gatasati. The actual fact is that everyone is a
servant of the Lord, as confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (jivera 'svarupa'
haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa'). As servants of the Lord, we are one, and there can be no questions of enmity
or friendship. If one actually understands that every one of us is a servant of the Lord, where is the
question of enemy or friend?
Everyone should be friendly for the service of the Lord. Everyone should praise another's service to the
Lord and not be proud of his own service. This is the way of Vaisnava thinking, Vaikuntha thinking.
There may be rivalries and apparent competition between servants in performing service, but in the
Vaikuntha planets the service of another servant is appreciated, not condemned. This is Vaikuntha
competition. There is no question of enmity between servants. Everyone should be allowed to render
service to the Lord to the best of his ability, and everyone should appreciate the service of others. Such are
the activities of Vaikuntha. Since everyone is a servant, everyone is on the same platform and is allowed to
serve the Lord according to his ability. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: the Lord is situated in everyone's heart, giving dictation
according to the attitude of the servant. However, the Lord gives different dictation to the nondevotees
and devotees. The nondevotees challenge the authority of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord
dictates in such a way that the nondevotees forget the Lord's service, life after life, and are punished by
the laws of nature. But when a devotee very sincerely wants to render service to the Lord, the Lord
dictates in a different way. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which
they can come to Me." Everyone is actually a servant, not an enemy or friend, and everyone is working
under different directions from the Lord, who directs each living entity according to his mentality.
