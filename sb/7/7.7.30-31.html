<h2>Translation</h2>
One must accept the bona fide spiritual master and render service unto him with great devotion and
faith. Whatever one has in one's possession should be offered to the spiritual master, and in the
association of saintly persons and devotees one should worship the Lord, hear the glories of the Lord with
faith, glorify the transcendental qualities and activities of the Lord, always meditate on the Lord's lotus
feet, and worship the Deity of the Lord strictly according to the injunctions of the sastra and guru.

<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verse it has been said that the process which immediately increases one's love and
affection for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the best of the many thousands of ways to become
free from the entanglement of material existence. It is also said, dharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam:
actually the truth of religious principles is extremely confidential. Nonetheless, it can be understood very
easily if one actually adopts the principles of religion. As it is said, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam:
the process of religion is enunciated by the Supreme Lord because He is the supreme authority. This is
also indicated in the previous verse by the word bhagavatoditah. The injunctions or directions of the Lord
are infallible, and their benefits are fully assured. According to His directions, which are explained in this
verse, the perfect form of religion is bhakti-yoga.
To practice bhakti-yoga, one must first accept a bona fide spiritual master. Srila Rupa Gosvami, in his
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.74-75), advises:
guru-padasrayas tasmat
krsna-diksadi-siksanam
visrambhena guroh seva
sadhu-vartmanuvartanam
sad-dharma-prccha bhogadityagah
krsnasya hetave
One's first duty is to accept a bona fide spiritual master. The student or disciple should be very
inquisitive; he should be eager to know the complete truth about eternal religion (sanatana-dharma). The
words guru-susrusaya mean that one should personally serve the spiritual master by giving him bodily
comforts, helping him in bathing, dressing, sleeping, eating and so on. This is called guru-susrusanam. A
disciple should serve the spiritual master as a menial servant, and whatever he has in his possession
should be dedicated to the spiritual master. pranair arthair dhiya vaca. Everyone has his life, his wealth,
his intelligence and his words, and all of them should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead
through the via medium of the spiritual master. Everything should be offered to the spiritual master as a
matter of duty, but the offering should be made to the spiritual master with heart and soul, not artificially
to gain material prestige. This offering is called arpana. Moreover, one should live among devotees, saintly
persons, to learn the etiquette and proper behavior of devotional service. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura remarks in this connection that whatever is offered to the spiritual master should be offered with
love and affection, not for material adoration. Similarly, it is recommended that one associate with
devotees, but there must be some discrimination. Actually, a sadhu, a saintly person, must be saintly in
his behavior (sadhavah sad-acarah). Unless one adheres to the standard behavior, one's position as a
sadhu, a saintly person, is not complete. Therefore a Vaisnava, a sadhu, must completely adhere to the
standard of behavior. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that a Vaisnava, a person initiated into the
Vaisnava cult, should be offered the respect befitting a Vaisnava, which means that he should be offered
service and prayers. However, one should not associate with him if he is not a fit person with whom to
associate.
