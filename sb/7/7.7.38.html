<h2>Translation</h2>
O my friends, sons of the asuras, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature always
exists within the cores of the hearts of all living entities. Indeed, He is the well-wisher and friend of all
living entities, and there is no difficulty in worshiping the Lord. Why, then, should people not engage in
His devotional service? Why are they so addicted to unnecessarily producing artificial paraphernalia for
sense gratification?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because the Personality of Godhead is supreme, no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him.
Nonetheless, if one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord is easily obtainable. The
Lord is compared to the sky because the sky is vast yet within the reach of all, not only of human beings
but even of the animals. The Supreme Lord, in His Paramatma feature, exists as the best well-wisher and
friend. As confirmed in the Vedas, sayujau sakhayau. The Lord, in His Supersoul feature, always stays in
the heart along with the living entity. The Lord is so friendly to the living entity that He remains within
the heart so that one can always contact Him without difficulty. One can do this simply by devotional
service (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam. pada-sevanam). As soon as one hears of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead (krsna-kirtana), one immediately comes in touch with the Lord. A devotee
immediately comes in touch with the Lord by any or all of the items of devotional service:
sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam
arcanam vandanam dasyam
sakhyam atma-nivedanam
Therefore there is no difficulty in coming in contact with the Supreme Lord (ko 'ti-prayasah). On the
other hand, going to hell requires great endeavor. If one wants to go to hell by illicit sex, meat-eating,
gambling and intoxication, he must acquire so many things. For illicit sex he must arrange for money for
brothels, for meat-eating he must arrange for many slaughterhouses, for gambling he must arrange for
casinos and hotels, and for intoxication he must open many breweries. Clearly, therefore, if one wants to
go to hell he must endeavor very much, but if he wants to return home, back to Godhead, there is no
difficult endeavor. To go back to Godhead, one may live alone anywhere, in any condition, and simply sit
down, meditate upon the Supersoul and chant and hear about the Lord. Thus there is no difficulty in
approaching the Lord. Adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram. Because of inability to control the senses, one
must go through great endeavor to go to hell, but if one is sensible he can very easily obtain the favor of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead because the Lord is always with him. By the simple method of
sravanam kirtanam visnoh, the Lord is satisfied. Indeed, the Lord says:
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." (Bg. 9.26) One
can meditate upon the Lord anywhere and everywhere. Thus Prahlada Maharaja advised his friends, the
sons of the demons, to take this path back home, back to Godhead, without difficulty.
