<h2>Translation</h2>
To prove that the statement of His servant Prahlada Maharaja was substantial--in other words, to prove
that the Supreme Lord is present everywhere, even within the pillar of an assembly hall--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, exhibited a wonderful form never before seen. The form was neither that of
a man nor that of a lion. Thus the Lord appeared in His wonderful form in the assembly hall.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Hiranyakasipu asked Prahlada Maharaja, "Where is your Lord? Is He present in this pillar?"
Prahlada Maharaja fearlessly replied, "Yes, my Lord is present everywhere." Therefore, to convince
Hiranyakasipu that the statement of Prahlada Maharaja was unmistakably true, the Lord appeared from
the pillar. The Lord appeared as half lion and half man so that Hiranyakasipu could not understand
whether the great giant was a lion or a human being. To substantiate Prahlada's statement, the Lord
proved that His devotee, as declared in Bhagavad-gita, is never vanquished (kaunteya pratijanihi na me
bhaktah pranasyati). Prahlada Maharaja's demoniac father had repeatedly threatened to kill Prahlada, but
Prahlada was confident that he could not be killed, since he was protected by the Supreme Lord. By
appearing from the pillar, the Lord encouraged His devotee, saying in effect, "Don't worry. I am present
here." By manifesting His form as Nrsimhadeva, the Lord also preserved the truth of Lord Brahma's
promise that Hiranyakasipu was not to be killed by any animal or any man. The Lord appeared in a form
that could not be said to be fully a man or a lion.
