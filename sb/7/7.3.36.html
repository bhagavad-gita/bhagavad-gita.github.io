<h2>Translation</h2>
Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night,
nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought by any being other than those
created by you, nor by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu was very much afraid of Visnu's becoming an animal to kill him because his brother had
been killed by Visnu when the Lord took the shape of a boar. He was therefore very careful to guard
against all kinds of animals. But even without taking the shape of an animal, Visnu could kill him by
hurling His Sudarsana cakra, which can go anywhere without the Lord's physical presence. Therefore
Hiranyakasipu was careful to guard against all kinds of weapons. He guarded against all kinds of time,
space and countries because he was afraid of being killed by someone else in another land. There are
many other planets, higher and lower, and therefore he prayed for the benediction of not being killed by
any resident of any of these planets. There are three original deities--Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara.
Hiranyakasipu knew that Brahma would not kill him, but he also wanted not to be killed by Lord Visnu or
Lord Siva. Consequently, he prayed for such a benediction. Thus Hiranyakasipu thought himself securely
protected from any kind of death caused by any living entity within this universe. He also carefully
guarded against natural death, which might take place within his house or outside of the house.
