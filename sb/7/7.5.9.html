<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
vatsa prahrada bhadram te
satyam kathaya ma mrsa
balan ati kutas tubhyam
esa buddhi-viparyayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vatsa--O dear son; prahrada--Prahlada; bhadram te--all blessings and good fortune unto you; satyam--
the truth; kathaya--speak; ma--do not; mrsa--a lie; balan ati--passing over the other demon boys; kutah--
from where; tubhyam--unto you; esah--this; buddhi--of the intelligence; viparyayah--pollution.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dear son Prahlada, all peace and good fortune unto you. Kindly do not speak lies; just reply with the
truth. These boys you see are not like you, for they do not speak in a deviant way. How have you learned
these instructions? How has your intelligence been spoiled in this way?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja was still a boy, and therefore his teachers thought that if they pacified the little boy
he would immediately speak the truth, revealing the secret of how the Vaisnavas came there to teach him
lessons in devotional service. It was surprising, of course, that in the same school the other boys of the
Daityas were not polluted; only Prahlada Maharaja was supposedly polluted by the instructions of the
Vaisnavas. The main duty of the teachers was to inquire who those Vaisnavas were that came to teach
Prahlada and spoil his intelligence.
