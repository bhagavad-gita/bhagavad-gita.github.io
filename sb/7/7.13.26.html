<h2>Translation</h2>
In this human form of life, a man and women unite for the sensual pleasure of sex, but by actual
experience we have observed that none of them are happy. Therefore, seeing the contrary results, I have
stopped taking part in materialistic activities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Prahlada Maharaja, yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham. Man and woman both
seek sexual enjoyment, and when they are united by the ritualistic ceremony of marriage, they are happy
for some time, but finally there is dissension, and thus there are so many cases of separation and divorce.
Although every man and woman is actually eager to enjoy life through sexual unity, the result is disunity
and distress. Marriage is recommended to give men and women a concession for restricted sex life, which
is also recommended in Bhagavad-gita by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dharmaviruddho bhutesu
kamo 'smi: sex life not against the principles of religion is Krsna. Every living entity is always eager to
enjoy sex life because materialistic life consists of eating, sleeping, sex and fear. In animal life, eating,
sleeping, sexual enjoyment and fear cannot be regulated, but for human society the plan is that although
men, like animals, must be allowed to eat, sleep, enjoy sex and take protection from fear, they must be
regulated. The Vedic plan for eating recommends that one take yajna-sista, or prasada, food offered to
Krsna. Yajna-sistasinah santo mucyante sama-kilbisaih: "The devotees of the Lord are released from all
kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered first for sacrifice." (Bg. 3.13) In material life, one
commits sinful activities, especially in eating, and because of sinful activities one is condemned by
nature's laws to accept another body, which is imposed as punishment. Sex and eating are essential, and
therefore they are offered to human society under Vedic restrictions so that according to the Vedic
injunctions people may eat, sleep, enjoy sex, be protected from fearful life and gradually be elevated and
liberated from the punishment of material existence. Thus the Vedic injunctions for marriage offer a
concession to human society, the idea being that a man and woman united in a ritualistic marriage
ceremony should help one another advance in spiritual life. Unfortunately, especially in this age, men and
women unite for unrestricted sexual enjoyment. Thus they are victimized, being obliged to take rebirth in
the forms of animals to fulfill their animalistic propensities. The Vedic injunctions therefore warn, nayam
deho deha-bhajam nrloke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhujam ye. One should not enjoy sex life like hogs,
and eat everything, even to the limit of stool. A human being should eat prasada offered to the Deity and
should enjoy sex life according to the Vedic injunctions. He should engage himself in the business of
Krsna consciousness, he should save himself from the fearful condition of material existence, and he
should sleep only to recover from fatigue due to working hard.
The learned brahmana said that since everything is misused by fruitive workers, he had retired from all
fruitive activities.
