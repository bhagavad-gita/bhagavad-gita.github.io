<h2>Text</h2>
jiva-rasibhir akirna
anda-kosanghripo mahan
tan-mulatvad acyutejya
sarva-jivatma-tarpanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jiva-rasibhih--by millions and millions of living entities; akirnah--filled up or spread over; anda-kosa--
the whole universe; anghripah--like a tree; mahan--very, very great; tat-mulatvat--because of being the
root of this tree; acyuta-ijya--worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva--of all; jiva-atma--
living entities; tarpanam--satisfaction.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The entire universe, which is full of living entities, is like a tree whose root is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Acyuta [Krsna]. Therefore simply by worshiping Lord Krsna one can worship all living
entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (10.8) the Lord says:
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who
perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts." People are very
much anxious to give service to other living entities, especially to the poor, but although they have
manufactured many ways to give such help, actually they are expert in killing the poor living entities.
This sort of service or mercy is not recommended in the Vedic wisdom. As stated in a previous verse, it
has been decided (niruktam) by expert saintly persons that Krsna is the root of everything and that
worshiping Krsna is worshiping everyone, just as supplying water to the root of a tree means satisfying all
of its branches and twigs.
Another point is that this universe is full of living entities from top to bottom, on every planet (jivarasibhir
akirnah). Modern scientists and so-called scholars think that there are no living entities on
planets other than this one. Recently they have said that they have gone to the moon but did not find any
living entities there. But Srimad-Bhagavatam and the other Vedic literatures do not agree with this foolish
conception. There are living entities everywhere, not only one or two but jiva-rasibhih--many millions of
living entities. Even on the sun there are living entities, although it is a fiery planet. The chief living entity
on the sun is called Vivasvan (imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam). All the different planets
are filled with different types of living entities according to different living conditions. To suggest that
only this planet is filled with living entities and that others are vacant is foolish. This betrays a lack of real
knowledge.
