<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
dharmartham api neheta
yatrartham vadhano dhanam
anihanihamanasya
mahaher iva vrttida
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharma-artham--in religion or economic development; api--indeed; na--not; iheta--should try to obtain;
yatra-artham--just to maintain the body and soul together; va--either; adhanah--one who has no wealth;
dhanam--money; aniha--the desirelessness; anihamanasya--of a person who does not endeavor even to
earn his livelihood; maha-aheh--the great serpent known as the python; iva--like; vrtti-da--which obtains
its livelihood without endeavor.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even if a man is poor, he should not endeavor to improve his economic condition just to maintain his
body and soul together or to become a famous religionist. Just as a great python, although lying in one
place, not endeavoring for its livelihood, gets the food it needs to maintain body and soul, one who is
desireless also obtains his livelihood without endeavor.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Human life is simply meant for developing Krsna consciousness. One need not even try to earn a
livelihood to maintain body and soul together. This is illustrated here by the example of the great python,
which lies in one place, never going here and there to earn a livelihood to maintain itself, and yet is
maintained by the grace of the Lord. As advised by Narada Muni (Bhag. 1.5.18), tasyaiva hetoh prayateta
kovidah: one should simply endeavor to increase his Krsna consciousness. One should not desire to do
anything else, even to earn his livelihood. There are many, many examples of this attitude. Madhavendra
Puri, for instance, would never go to anyone to ask for food. Sukadeva Gosvami has also said, kasmad
bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmadandhan. Why should one approach a person who is blind with wealth?
Rather, one should depend on Krsna, and He will give everything. All the members of our Krsna
consciousness movement, whether they be grhasthas or sannyasis, should try to spread the Krsna
consciousness movement with determination, and Krsna will supply all necessities. The process of
ajagara-vrtti, the means of livelihood of a python, is very much appreciated in this regard. Even though
one may be very poor, he should simply try to advance in Krsna consciousness and not endeavor to earn
his livelihood.
