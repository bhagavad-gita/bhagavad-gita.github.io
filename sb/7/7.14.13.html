<h2>Text</h2>
krmi-vid-bhasma-nisthantam
kvedam tuccham kalevaram
kva tadiya-ratir bharya
kvayam atma nabhas-chadih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
krmi--insects, germs; vit--stool; bhasma--ashes; nistha--attachment; antam--at the end; kva--what is;
idam--this (body); tuccham--very insignificant; kalevaram--material tabernacle; kva--what is that; tadiyaratih--
attraction for that body; bharya--wife; kva ayam--what is the value of this body; atma--the Supreme
Soul; nabhah-chadih--all-pervading like the sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Through proper deliberation, one should give up attraction to his wife's body because that body will
ultimately be transformed into small insects, stool or ashes. What is the value of this insignificant body?
How much greater is the Supreme Being, who is all-pervading like the sky?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here also, the same point is stressed: one should give up attachment for his wife--or, in other words, for
sex life. If one is intelligent, he can think of his wife's body as nothing but a lump of matter that will
ultimately be transformed into small insects, stool or ashes. In different societies there are different ways
of dealing with the human body at the time of the funeral ceremony. In some societies the body is given to
the vultures to be eaten, and therefore the body ultimately turns to vulture stool. Sometimes the body is
merely abandoned, and in that case the body is consumed by small insects. In some societies the body is
immediately burned after death, and thus it becomes ashes. In any case, if one intelligently considers the
constitution of the body and the soul beyond it, what is the value of the body? Antavanta ime deha
nityasyoktah saririnah: the body may perish at any moment, but the soul is eternal. If one gives up
attachment for the body and increases his attachment for the spirit soul, his life is successful. It is merely a
matter of deliberation.
