<h2>Text</h2>
esa vai bhagavan saksat
pradhana-purusesvarah
yogesvarair vimrgyanghrir
loko yam manyate naram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
esah--this; vai--indeed; bhagavan--Supreme Personality of Godhead; saksat--directly; pradhana--the
chief cause of the material nature; purusa--of all living entities or of the purusavatara, Lord Visnu;
isvarah--the supreme controller; yoga-isvaraih--by great saintly persons, yogis; vimrgya-anghrih--Lord
Krsna's lotus feet, which are sought; lokah--people in general; yam--Him; manyate--consider; naram--a
human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is the master of all other living entities and of the
material nature. His lotus feet are sought and worshiped by great saintly persons like Vyasa. Nonetheless,
there are fools who consider Lord Krsna an ordinary human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The example of Lord Krsna's being the Supreme Personality of Godhead is appropriate in regard to
understanding the spiritual master. The spiritual master is called sevaka-bhagavan, the servitor
Personality of Godhead, and Krsna is called sevya-bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is
to be worshiped. The spiritual master is the worshiper God, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, is the worshipable God. This is the difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
Another point: Bhagavad-gita, which constitutes the instructions of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is presented by the spiritual master as it is, without deviation. Therefore the Absolute Truth is
present in the spiritual master. As clearly stated in Text 26, jnana-dipa-prade. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead gives real knowledge to the entire world, and the spiritual master, as the representative of the
Supreme Godhead, carries the message throughout the world. Therefore, on the absolute platform, there
is no difference between the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If someone
considers the Supreme Personality--Krsna or Lord Ramacandra--to be an ordinary human being, this does
not mean that the Lord becomes an ordinary human being. Similarly, if the family members of the
spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, consider the
spiritual master an ordinary human being, this does not mean that he becomes an ordinary human being.
The spiritual master is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore one who is very
serious about spiritual advancement must regard the spiritual master in this way. Even a slight deviation
from this understanding can create disaster in the disciple's Vedic studies and austerities.
