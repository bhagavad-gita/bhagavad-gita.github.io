asvaghante 'vasayibhyah
kaman samvibhajed yatha
apy ekam atmano daram
nrnam svatva-graho yatah
SYNONYMS
a--even up to; sva--the dog; agha--sinful animals or living entities; ante avasayibhyah--unto the candalas,
the lowest of men (dog-eaters and hog-eaters); kaman--the necessities of life; samvibhajet--should divide;
yatha--as much as (deserved); api--even; ekam--one; atmanah--own; daram--the wife; nrnam--of the
people in general; svatva-grahah--the wife is accepted as being identical with one's self; yatah--because of
which.
TRANSLATION
Dogs, fallen persons and untouchables, including candalas [dog-eaters], should all be maintained with
their proper necessities, which should be contributed by the householders. Even one's wife at home, with
whom one is most intimately attached, should be offered for the reception of guests and people in general.
PURPORT
Although in modern society the dog is accepted as part of one's household paraphernalia, in the Vedic
system of household life the dog is untouchable; as mentioned here, a dog may be maintained with proper
food, but it cannot be allowed to enter one's house, what to speak of the bedroom. Outcastes or
untouchable candalas should also be provided with the necessities for life. The word used in this
connection is yatha, which means "as much as deserved." The outcastes should not be given money with
which to indulge in more than they need, for otherwise they will misuse it. At the present moment, for
example, low-class men are generally paid quite amply, but instead of using their money to cultivate
knowledge and advance in life, such low-class men use their extra money for wine-drinking and similar
sinful activities. As mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karmavibhagasah:
there must be four divisions of human society according to the work and qualities of men.
Men with the lowest qualities cannot do any work that requires higher intelligence. However, although
such a division of men must exist according to their quality and work, it is suggested herewith that
everyone must have the necessities of life. The communists of the present day are in favor of supplying
the necessities of life to everyone, but they consider only the human beings and not the lower animals.
The Bhagavatam's principles are so broad, however, that it recommends that the necessities of life be
supplied to everyone, man or animal, regardless of good or bad qualities.
The idea of giving even one's wife to the service of the public is that one's intimate relationship with his
wife, or one's excessive attachment for his wife, by which one thinks his wife to be his better half or to be
identical with himself, must gradually be given up. As formerly suggested, the idea of ownership, even of
one's family, must be abandoned. The dream of material life is the cause of bondage in the cycle of birth
and death, and therefore one should give up this dream. Consequently, in the human form of life one's
attachment for his wife should be given up, as suggested herein.
