<h2>Text</h2>
tasmad daivopapannena
muny-annenapi dharmavit
santusto 'har ahah kuryan
nitya-naimittikih kriyah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; daiva-upapannena--obtainable very easily by the grace of the Lord; muni-annena--
with food (prepared in ghee and offered to the Supreme Lord); api--indeed; dharma-vit--one who is
actually advanced in religious principles; santustah--very happily; ahah ahah--day after day; kuryat--one
should perform; nitya-naimittikih--regular and occasional; kriyah--duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, day by day, one who is actually aware of religious principles and is not heinously envious of
poor animals should happily perform daily sacrifices and those for certain occasions with whatever food is
available easily by the grace of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word dharmavit, meaning "one who knows the actual purpose of religion," is very significant. As
explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.66), sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: becoming Krsna
conscious is the topmost stage in understanding of religious principles. One who reaches this stage
performs the arcana process in devotional service. Anyone, whether a grhastha or a sannyasi, can keep
small Deities of the Lord suitably packed or, if possible, installed, and thus worship the Deities of Radha-
Krsna, Sita-Rama, Laksmi-Narayana, Lord Jagannatha or Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by offering food
prepared in ghee and then offering the sanctified prasada to the forefathers, demigods and other living
entities as a matter of routine daily work. All the centers of our Krsna consciousness movement have
Deity worship programs very nicely going on in which food is offered to the Deity and distributed to the
first-class brahmanas and Vaisnavas and even to the people in general. This performance of sacrifice
brings complete satisfaction. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement engage daily in such
transcendental activities. Thus in our Krsna consciousness movement there is no question at all of killing
animals.
