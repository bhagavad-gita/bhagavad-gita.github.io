pare brahmany anirdesye
bhagavaty akhilatmani
yuktatmany aphala asann
apunyasyeva sat-kriyah
SYNONYMS
pare--in the supreme; brahmani--absolute; anirdesye--who is not perceivable by the senses; bhagavati--
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; akhila-atmani--the Supersoul of everyone; yukta-atmani--on he
whose mind was engaged (Prahlada); aphalah--without effect; asan--were; apunyasya--of a person who
has no assets in pious activities; iva--like; sat-kriyah--good activities (like the performance of sacrifices or
austerities).
TRANSLATION
Even though a person who has no assets in pious activities performs some good deed, it will have no
result. Thus the weapons of the demons had no tangible effects upon Prahlada Maharaja because he was a
devotee undisturbed by material conditions and fully engaged in meditating upon and serving the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unchangeable, who cannot be realized by the material senses,
and who is the soul of the entire universe.
PURPORT
Prahlada Maharaja was constantly and fully engaged in thought of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
As it is said, govinda-parirambhitah. Prahlada Maharaja engaged himself always in meditation, and thus
he was protected by Govinda. Just as a small child on the lap of his father or mother is fully protected, a
devotee, in all conditions, is protected by the Supreme Lord. Does this mean that when Prahlada Maharaja
was attacked by the demons, the Raksasas, Govinda was also attacked by the demons? This is not
possible. There have been many attempts by the demons to hurt or kill the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but He cannot be injured by any material means because He is always in transcendence.
Therefore the words pare brahmani are used here. The demons, the Raksasas, can neither see nor touch
the Supreme Lord, although they may superficially think that they are striking the Lord's transcendental
body with their material weapons. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this verse as
anirdesye. We cannot understand Him to be in a particular place, for He is all-pervasive. Moreover, He is
akhilatma, the active principle of everything, even material weapons. Those who cannot understand the
position of the Lord are unfortunate. They may think that they can kill the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and His devotee, but all their attempts will be futile. The Lord knows how to deal with them.
