<h2>Text</h2>
iti susruma nirbandham
tapah paramam asthitah
vidhatsvanantaram yuktam
svayam tri-bhuvanesvara
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--in this way; susruma--we have heard; nirbandham--strong determination; tapah--austerity;
paramam--very severe; asthitah--is situated in; vidhatsva--please take steps; anantaram--as soon as
possible; yuktam--befitting; svayam--yourself; tri-bhuvana-isvara--O master of the three worlds.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O lord, we have heard from reliable sources that in order to obtain your post, Hiranyakasipu is now
engaged in severe austerity. You are the master of the three worlds. Please, without delay, take whatever
steps you deem appropriate.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world, a servant is provided for by the master but is always planning how to capture the
master's post. There have been many instances of this in history. Especially in India during the
Mohammedan rule, many servants, by plans and devices, took over the posts of their masters. It is learned
from Caitanya literature that one big Zamindar, Subuddhi Raya, kept a Mohammedan boy as a servant. Of
course, he treated the boy as his own child, and sometimes, when the boy would steal something, the
master would chastise him by striking him with a cane. There was a mark on the boy's back from this
chastisement. Later, after that boy had by crooked means become Hussain Shah, Nawab of Bengal, one
day his wife saw the mark on his back and inquired about it. The Nawab replied that in his childhood he
had been a servant of Subuddhi Raya, who had punished him because of some mischievous activities.
Upon hearing this, the Nawab's wife immediately became agitated and requested her husband to kill
Subuddhi Raya. Nawab Hussain Shah, of course, was very grateful to Subuddhi Raya and therefore refused
to kill him, but when his wife requested him to turn Subuddhi Raya into a Mohammedan, the Nawab
agreed. Taking some water from his waterpot, he sprinkled it upon Subuddhi Raya and declared that
Subuddhi Raya had now become a Mohammedan. The point is that this Nawab had been an ordinary
menial servant of Subuddhi Raya but was somehow or other able to occupy the supreme post of Nawab of
Bengal. This is the material world. Everyone is trying to become master through various devices, although
everyone is servant of his senses. Following this system, a living entity, although servant of his senses,
tries to become master of the whole universe. Hiranyakasipu was a typical example of this, and Brahma
was informed by the demigods of his intentions.
