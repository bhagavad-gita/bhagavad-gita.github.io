<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, now I have complete experience concerning the worldly opulence, mystic power,
longevity and other material pleasures enjoyed by all living entities, from Lord Brahma down to the ant.
As powerful time, You destroy them all. Therefore, because of my experience, I do not wish to possess
them. My dear Lord, I request You to place me in touch with Your pure devotee and let me serve him as a
sincere servant.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By studying Srimad-Bhagavatam, every intelligent man can get experience like that of Prahlada Maharaja
through the historical incidents mentioned in this great literature of spiritual knowledge. By following in
the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, one should gain thorough experience that all material opulence is
perishable at every moment. Even this body, for which we try to acquire so many sensual pleasures, may
perish at any time. The soul, however, is eternal. Na hanyate hanyamane sarire: the soul is never
vanquished, even when the body is destroyed. An intelligent man, therefore, should care for the happiness
of the spirit soul, not of the body. Even if one receives a body with a long duration of life, like those of
Lord Brahma and the other great demigods, it will also be destroyed, and therefore an intelligent man
should be concerned with the imperishable spirit soul.
To save oneself, one must take shelter of a pure devotee. Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says,
chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba. If one wants to save himself from material nature's
onslaughts, which arise because of the material body, one must become Krsna conscious and try to fully
understand Krsna. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.
One should understand Krsna in truth, and this one can do only by serving a pure devotee. Thus Prahlada
Maharaja prays that Lord Nrsimhadeva place him in touch with a pure devotee and servant instead of
awarding him material opulence. Every intelligent man within this material world must follow Prahlada
Maharaja. Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah. Prahlada Maharaja did not want to enjoy the estate left by his
father; rather, he wanted to become a servant of the servant of the Lord. The illusory human civilization
that perpetually endeavors for happiness through material advancement is rejected by Prahlada Maharaja
and those who strictly follow in his footsteps.
There are different types of material opulence, known technically as bhukti, mukti and siddhi. Bhukti
refers to being situated in a very good position, like a position with the demigods in the higher planetary
systems, where one can enjoy material sense gratification to the greatest extent. Mukti refers to being
disgusted with material advancement and thus desiring to become one with the Supreme. Siddhi refers to
executing a severe type of meditation, like that of the yogis, to attain eight kinds of perfection (anima,
laghima, mahima, etc.). All who desire some material advancement through bhukti, mukti or siddhi are
punishable in due course of time, and they return to material activities. Prahlada Maharaja rejected them
all; he simply wanted to engage as an apprentice under the guidance of a pure devotee.
