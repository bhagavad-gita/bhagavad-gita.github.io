<h2>Text</h2>
na sisyan anubadhnita
granthan naivabhyased bahun
na vyakhyam upayunjita
narambhan arabhet kvacit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; sisyan--disciples; anubadhnita--one should induce for material benefit; granthan--unnecessary
literatures; na--not; eva--certainly; abhyaset--should try to understand or cultivate; bahun--many; na--nor;
vyakhyam--discourses; upayunjita--should make as a means of livelihood; na--nor; arambhan--
unnecessary opulences; arabhet--should attempt to increase; kvacit--at any time.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A sannyasi must not present allurements of material benefits to gather many disciples, nor should he
unnecessarily read many books or give discourses as a means of livelihood. He must never attempt to
increase material opulences unnecessarily.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
So-called svamis and yogis generally make disciples by alluring them with material benefits. There are
many so-called gurus who attract disciples by promising to cure their diseases or increase their material
opulence by manufacturing gold. These are lucrative allurements for unintelligent men. A sannyasi is
prohibited from making disciples through such material allurements. Sannyasis sometimes indulge in
material opulence by unnecessarily constructing many temples and monasteries, but actually such
endeavors should be avoided. Temples and monasteries should be constructed for the preaching of
spiritual consciousness or Krsna consciousness, not to provide free hotels for persons who are useful for
neither material nor spiritual purposes. Temples and monasteries should be strictly off limits to worthless
clubs of crazy men. In the Krsna consciousness movement we welcome everyone who agrees at least to
follow the movement's regulative principles--no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no
gambling. In the temples and monasteries, gatherings of unnecessary, rejected, lazy fellows should be
strictly disallowed. The temples and monasteries should be used exclusively by devotees who are serious
about spiritual advancement in Krsna consciousness. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains the
word arambhan as meaning mathadi-vyaparan, which means "attempts to construct temples and
monasteries." The first business of the sannyasi is to preach Krsna consciousness, but if, by the grace of
Krsna, facilities are available, then he may construct temples and monasteries to give shelter to the serious
students of Krsna consciousness. Otherwise such temples and monasteries are not needed.
