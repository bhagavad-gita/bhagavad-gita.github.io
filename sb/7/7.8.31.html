<h2>Text</h2>
nakhankurotpatita-hrt-saroruham
visrjya tasyanucaran udayudhan
ahan samastan nakha-sastra-panibhir
dordanda-yutho 'nupathan sahasrasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nakha-ankura--by the pointed nails; utpatita--torn out; hrt-saroruham--whose heart, which was like a
lotus flower; visrjya--leaving aside; tasya--of him; anucaran--the followers (soldiers and bodyguards);
udayudhan--having raised weapons; ahan--He killed; samastan--all; nakha-sastra-panibhih--with His nails
and other weapons in His hands; dordanda-yuthah--having unlimited arms; anupathan--the attendants of
Hiranyakasipu; sahasrasah--by thousands.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had many, many arms, first uprooted Hiranyakasipu's heart
and then threw him aside and turned toward the demon's soldiers. These soldiers had come in thousands
to fight with Him with raised weapons and were very faithful followers of Hiranyakasipu, but Lord
Nrsimhadeva killed all of them merely with the ends of His nails.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since the creation of the material world, there have been two kinds of men--the devas and the asuras.
The devas are always faithful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the asuras are always
atheists who defy the supremacy of the Lord. At the present moment, throughout the entire world, the
atheists are extremely numerous. They are trying to prove that there is no God and that everything takes
place due to combinations and permutations of material elements. Thus the material world is becoming
more and more godless, and consequently everything is in a disturbed condition. If this continues, the
Supreme personality of Godhead will certainly take action, as He did in the case of Hiranyakasipu. Within
a second, Hiranyakasipu and his followers were destroyed, and similarly if this godless civilization
continues, it will be destroyed in a second, simply by the movement of one finger of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The demons should therefore be careful and curtail their godless civilization.
They should take advantage of the Krsna consciousness movement and become faithful to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; otherwise they are doomed. As Hiranyakasipu was killed in a second, the godless
civilization can be destroyed at any moment.
