<h2>Text</h2>
tam sarva-bhutatma-bhutam
prasantam sama-darsanam
bhagavat-tejasa sprstam
nasaknod dhantum udyamaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--Him; sarva-bhuta-atma-bhutam--the soul in all entities; prasantam--peaceful and without hatred,
etc.; sama-darsanam--equal to everyone; bhagavat-tejasa--with the power of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; sprstam--protected; na--not; asaknot--was able; hantum--to kill; udyamaih--by great attempts
and various weapons.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, the Supersoul of all living entities, is sober, peaceful and equal to everyone. Since the great
devotee Prahlada was protected by the Lord's potency, Hiranyakasipu was unable to kill him, in spite of
endeavoring to do so in various ways.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word sarva-bhutatma-bhutam is very significant. Isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese
'rjuna tisthati: the Lord is equally situated in the core of everyone's heart. Thus He cannot be envious of
anyone or friendly to anyone; for Him everyone is the same. Although He is sometimes seen to punish
someone, this is exactly like a father's punishing his child for the child's welfare. The Supreme Lord's
punishment is also a manifestation of the Lord's equality. Therefore the Lord is described as prasantam
sama-darsanam. Although the Lord has to execute His will properly, He is equipoised in all
circumstances. He is equally disposed toward everyone.
