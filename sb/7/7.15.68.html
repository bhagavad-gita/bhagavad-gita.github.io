<p></p>

yatha--as; hi--indeed; yuyam--all of you (Pandavas); nrpa-deva--O lord of the kings, human beings and
demigods; dustyajat--insurmountable; apat--dangerous conditions; ganat--from all; uttarata--escaped;
atmanah--own; prabhoh--of the Lord; yat-pada-pankeruha--whose lotus feet; sevaya--by serving; bhavan--
yourself; aharasit--performed; nirjita--defeating; dik-gajah--the most powerful enemies, who were like
elephants; kratun--ritualistic ceremonies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King Yudhisthira, because of your service to the Supreme Lord, all of you Pandavas defeated the
greatest dangers posed by numerous kings and demigods. By serving the lotus feet of Krsna, you
conquered great enemies, who were like elephants, and thus you collected ingredients for sacrifice. By His
grace, may you be delivered from material involvement.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Placing himself as an ordinary householder, Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired from Narada Muni how a
grha-mudha-dhi, a person who is entangled in household life and who thus continues to remain a fool,
can be delivered. Narada Muni encouraged Maharaja Yudhisthira by saying, "You are already on the safe
side because you, along with your entire family, have become a pure devotee of Krsna." By Krsna's grace,
the Pandavas conquered in the Battle of Kuruksetra and were saved from many dangers posed not only by
kings but sometimes even by the demigods. Thus they are a practical example of how to live in security
and safety by the grace of Krsna. Everyone should follow the example of the Pandavas, who showed how
to be saved by the grace of Krsna. Our Krsna consciousness movement is intended to teach how everyone
can live peacefully in this material world and at the end of life return home, back to Godhead. In the
material world there are always dangers at every step (padam padam yad vipadam na tesam). Nonetheless,
if one takes shelter of Krsna without hesitation and keeps under the shelter of Krsna, he can easily cross
the ocean of nescience. Samasrita ye pada-pallava-plavam mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh. To the
devotee, this great ocean of nescience becomes like a puddle of water in the hoofprint of a cow. A pure
devotee, without embarrassing himself by trying for elevation in so many ways, stays in the safest position
as a servant of Krsna, and thus his life is eternally safe without a doubt.
