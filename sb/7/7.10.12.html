<h2>Text</h2>
katha madiya jusamanah priyas tvam
avesya mam atmani santam ekam
sarvesu bhutesv adhiyajnam isam
yajasva yogena ca karma hinvan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kathah--messages or instructions; madiyah--given by Me; jusamanah--always hearing or contemplating;
priyah--extremely pleasing; tvam--yourself; avesya--being fully absorbed in; mam--Me; atmani--within the
core of your heart; santam--existing; ekam--one (the same Supreme Soul); sarvesu--in all; bhutesu--living
entities; adhiyajnam--the enjoyer of all ritualistic ceremonies; isam--the Supreme Lord; yajasva--worship;
yogena--by bhakti-yoga, devotional service; ca--also; karma--fruitive activities; hinvan--giving up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It does not matter that you are in the material world. You should always, continuously, hear the
instructions and messages given by Me and always be absorbed in thought of Me, for I am the Supersoul
existing in the core of everyone's heart. Therefore, give up fruitive activities and worship Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a devotee becomes materially very opulent, one should not think that he is enjoying the results of
his fruitive activities. A devotee in this material world uses all material opulences for the service of the
Lord because he is planning how to serve the Lord with these opulences, as advised by the Lord Himself.
Whatever material opulence is within his possession he engages to expand the glories and service of the
Lord. A devotee never performs any fruitive or ritualistic ceremony to enjoy the results of such karma.
Rather, a devotee knows that karma-kanda is meant for the less intelligent man. Narottama dasa Thakura
says in his prema-bhakti-candrika, karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda: both karma-kanda
and jnana-kanda--fruitive activities and speculation about the Supreme Lord--are like pots of poison. One
who is attracted to karma-kanda and jnana-kanda spoils his existence as a human being. Therefore a
devotee is never interested in karma-kanda or jnana-kanda, but is simply interested in favorable service to
the Lord (anukulyena krsnanusilanam), or cultivation of spiritual activities in devotional service.
