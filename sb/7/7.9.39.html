<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord of the Vaikuntha planets, where there is no anxiety, my mind is extremely sinful and
lusty, being sometimes so-called happy and sometimes so-called distressed. My mind is full of lamentation
and fear, and it always seeks more and more money. Thus it has become most polluted and is never
satisfied in topics concerning You. I am therefore most fallen and poor. In such a status of life, how shall I
be able to discuss Your activities?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here Prahlada Maharaja represents himself as a common man, although he actually has nothing to do
with this material world. Prahlada is always situated in the Vaikuntha planets of the spiritual world, but
on behalf of the fallen souls he asks how, when his mind is always disturbed by material things, he can
discuss the transcendental position of the Lord. The mind becomes sinful because we are always engaged
in sinful activities. Anything not connected with Krsna consciousness should be understood to be sinful.
Indeed, Krsna demands in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." As soon as one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, Krsna
immediately relieves one of the reactions of sinful activities. Therefore one who is not surrendered to the
lotus feet of the Lord should be understood to be sinful, foolish, degraded among men and bereft of all
real knowledge because of atheistic propensities. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
Therefore, especially in this age of Kali, the mind must be cleansed, and this is possible only by the
chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Ceto-darpana-marjanam. In this age, the process of chanting
the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only method by which to cleanse the sinful mind. When the mind is
completely cleansed of all sinful reactions, one can then understand his duty in the human form of life.
The Krsna consciousness movement is meant to educate sinful men so that they may become pious simply
by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
To cleanse the heart so that one may become sober and wise in this age of Kali, there is no value to any
method other than the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Prahlada Maharaja has confirmed this
process in previous verses. Tvad-virya-gayana-mahamrta-magna-cittah. Prahlada further confirms that if
one's mind is always absorbed in thought of Krsna, that very qualification will purify one and keep one
purified always. To understand the Lord and His activities, one must free his mind from all contamination
of the material world, and this one can achieve by simply chanting the Lord's holy name. Thus one
becomes free from all material bondage.
