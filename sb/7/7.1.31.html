<h2>Text</h2>
gopyah kamad bhayat kamso
dvesac caidyadayo nrpah
sambandhad vrsnayah snehad
yuyam bhaktya vayam vibho
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
gopyah--the gopis; kamat--out of lusty desires; bhayat--out of fear; kamsah--King Kamsa; dvesat--out of
envy; caidya-adayah--Sisupala and others; nrpah--kings; sambandhat--out of kinship; vrsnayah--the Vrsnis
or the Yadavas; snehat--out of affection; yuyam--you (the Pandavas); bhaktya--by devotional service;
vayam--we; vibho--O great King.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Yudhisthira, the gopis by their lusty desires, Kamsa by his fear, Sisupala and other kings
by envy, the Yadus by their familial relationship with Krsna, you Pandavas by your great affection for
Krsna, and we, the general devotees, by our devotional service, have obtained the mercy of Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Different persons achieve different types of mukti--sayujya, salokya, sarupya, samipya and sarsti--
according to their own intense desire, which is called bhava. Thus it is described here that the gopis, by
their lusty desires, which were based upon their intense love for Krsna, became the most beloved devotees
of the Lord. Although the gopis at Vrndavana expressed their lusty desires in relationship with a
paramour (parakiya-rasa), they actually had no lusty desires. This is significant of spiritual advancement.
Their desires appeared lusty, but actually they were not the lusty desires of the material world. Caitanyacaritamrta
compares the desires of the spiritual and material world to gold and iron. Both gold and iron
are metal, but there is a vast difference in their value. The lusty desires of the gopis for Krsna are
compared to gold, and material lusty desires are compared to iron.
Kamsa and other enemies of Krsna merged into the existence of Brahman, but why should Krsna's
friends and devotees have the same position? Krsna's devotees attain the association of the Lord as His
constant companions, either in Vrndavana or in the Vaikuntha planets. Similarly, although Narada Muni
wanders in the three worlds, he has exalted devotion for Narayana (aisvaryaman). The Vrsnis and Yadus
and the father and mother of Krsna in Vrndavana all have familial relationships with Krsna; Krsna's foster
father and mother in Vrndavana, however, are more exalted than Vasudeva and Devaki.
