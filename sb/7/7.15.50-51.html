<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Yudhisthira, when oblations of ghee and food grains like barley and sesame are offered in
sacrifice, they turn into celestial smoke, which carries one to successively higher planetary systems like
the kingdoms of Dhuma, Ratri, Krsnapaksa, Daksinam and ultimately the moon. Then, however, the
performers of sacrifice descend again to earth to become herbs, creepers, vegetables and food grains.
These are eaten by different living entities and turned to semen, which is injected into female bodies.
Thus one takes birth again and again.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.21):
te tam bhuktva svarga-lokam visalam
ksine punye martya-lokam visanti
evam trayi-dharmam anuprapanna
gatagatam kama-kama labhante
"When those who follow the pravrtti-marga have enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this
mortal planet again. Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve only flickering happiness."
Following the pravrtti-marga, the living entity who desires to be promoted to the higher planetary systems
performs sacrifices regularly, and how he goes up and comes down again is described here in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, as well as in Bhagavad-gita. It is also said, traigunya-visaya vedah: "The Vedas deal mainly
with the three modes of material nature." The Vedas, especially three Vedas, namely Sama, Yajur and Rk,
vividly describe this process of ascending to the higher planets and returning. But Krsna advises Arjuna,
traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna: one has to transcend these three modes of material nature,
and then one will be released from the cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, although one may be
promoted to a higher planetary system such as Candraloka, one must again come down (ksine punye
martya-lokam visanti). After one's enjoyment due to pious activities is finished, one must return to this
planet in rainfall and first take birth as a plant or creeper, which is eaten by various animals, including
human beings, and turned to semen. This semen is injected into the female body, and thus the living
entity takes birth. Those who return to earth in this way take birth especially in higher families like those
of brahmanas.
It may be remarked in this connection that even the modern so-called scientists who are going to the
moon are not able to stay there, but are returning to their laboratories. Therefore, whether one goes to the
moon by modern mechanical arrangements or by performing pious activities, one must return to earth.
That is clearly stated in this verse and explained in Bhagavad-gita. Even if one goes to the higher planetary
systems (yanti deva-vrata devan), one's place there is not secure; one must return to martya-loka.
Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna: aside from the moon, even if one goes to Brahmaloka,
one must return. Yam prapya na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama: but if one goes back home, back
to Godhead, he need not return to this material world.
