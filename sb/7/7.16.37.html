yaih sva-dehah smrto 'natma
martyo vit-krmi-bhasmavat
ta enam atmasat krtva
slaghayanti hy asattamah
SYNONYMS
yaih--by sannyasis who; sva-dehah--own body; smrtah--consider; anatma--different from the soul;
martyah--subjected to death; vit--becoming stool; krmi--worms; bhasma-vat--or ashes; te--such persons;
enam--this body; atmasat krtva--again identifying with the self; slaghayanti--glorify as very important; hi--
indeed; asat-tamah--the greatest rascals.
TRANSLATION
Sannyasis who first consider that the body is subject to death, when it will be transformed into stool,
worms or ashes, but who again give importance to the body and glorify it as the self, are to be considered
the greatest rascals.
PURPORT
A sannyasi is one who has clearly understood, through advancement in knowledge, that Brahman--he,
the person himself--is the soul, not the body. One who has this understanding may take sannyasa, for he
is situated in the "aham brahmasmi" position. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati. Such a
person, who no longer laments or hankers to maintain his body and who can accept all living entities as
spirit souls, can then enter the devotional service of the Lord. If one does not enter the devotional service
of the Lord but artificially considers himself Brahman or Narayana, not perfectly understanding that the
soul and body are different, one certainly falls down (patanty adhah). Such a person again gives
importance to the body. There are many sannyasis in India who stress the importance of the body. Some
of them give special importance to the body of the poor man, accepting him as daridra-narayana, as if
Narayana had a material body. Many other sannyasis stress the importance of the social position of the
body as a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra. Such sannyasis are considered the greatest rascals
(asattamah). They are shameless because they have not yet understood the difference between the body
and the soul and instead have accepted the body of a brahmana to be a brahmana. Brahmanism
(brahmanya) consists of the knowledge of Brahman. But actually the body of a brahmana is not Brahman.
Similarly, the body is neither rich nor poor. If the body of a poor man were daridra-narayana, this would
mean that the body of a rich man, on the contrary, must be dhani-narayana. Therefore sannyasis who do
not know the meaning of Narayana, those who regard the body as Brahman or as Narayana, are described
here as asattamah, the most abominable rascals. Following the bodily concept of life, such sannyasis make
various programs to serve the body. They conduct farcical missions consisting of so-called religious
activities meant to mislead all of human society. These sannyasis have been described herein as apatrapah
and asattamah--shameless and fallen from spiritual life.
TEXTS 38-39
grhasthasya kriya-tyago
vrata-tyago vatorapi
tapasvino grama-seva
bhiksor indriya-lolata
asramapasada hy ete
khalv asrama-vidambanah
deva-maya-vimudhams tan
upeksetanukampaya
SYNONYMS
grhasthasya--for a person situated in householder life; kriya-tyagah--to give up the duty of a
householder; vrata-tyagah--to give up vows and austerity; vatoh--for a brahmacari; api--also; tapasvinah--
for a vanaprastha, one who has adopted a life of austerities; grama-seva--to live in a village and serve the
people therein; bhiksoh--for a sannyasi who lived by begging alms; indriya-lolata--addicted to sense
enjoyment; asrama--of the spiritual orders of life; apasadah--the most abominable; hi--indeed; ete--all
these; khalu--indeed; asrama-vidambanah--imitating and therefore cheating the different spiritual orders;
deva-maya-vimudhan--who are bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Lord; tan--them;
upekseta--one should reject and not accept as genuine; anukampaya--or by compassion (teach them real
life).
TRANSLATION
It is abominable for a person living in the grhastha-asrama to give up the regulative principles, for a
brahmacari not to follow the brahmacari vows while living under the care of the guru, for a vanaprastha
to live in the village and engage in so-called social activities, or for a sannyasi to be addicted to sense
gratification. One who acts in this way is to be considered the lowest renegade. Such a pretender is
bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should either reject
him from any position, or taking compassion upon him, teach him, if possible, to resume his original
position.
PURPORT
We have repeatedly stressed that human culture does not begin unless one takes to the principles of
varnasrama-dharma. Although grhastha life is a concession for the enjoyment of sex, one cannot enjoy sex
without following the rules and regulations of householder life. Furthermore, as already instructed, a
brahmacari must live under the care of the guru: brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto guror hitam. If a
brahmacari does not live under the care of the guru, if a vanaprastha engages in ordinary activities, or if a
sannyasi is greedy and eats meat, eggs and all kinds of nonsense for the satisfaction of his tongue, he is a
cheater and should immediately be rejected as unimportant. Such persons should be shown compassion,
and if one has sufficient strength one should teach them to stop them from following the wrong path in
life. Otherwise one should reject them and pay them no attention.
