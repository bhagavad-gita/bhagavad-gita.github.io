<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/7/7.6.8.html">7.6.8</a></h2>

<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
durapurena kamena
mohena ca baliyasa
sesam grhesu saktasya
pramattasyapayati hi
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
durapurena--which is never fulfilled; kamena--by a strong aspiration to enjoy the material world;
mohena--by bewilderment; ca--also; baliyasa--which is strong and formidable; sesam--the remaining years
of life; grhesu--to family life; saktasya--of one who is too attached; pramattasya--mad; apayati--wastefully
pass; hi--indeed.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One whose mind and senses are uncontrolled becomes increasingly attached to family life because of
insatiable lusty desires and very strong illusion. In such a madman's life, the remaining years are also
wasted because even during those years he cannot engage himself in devotional service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the account of one hundred years of life. Although in this age a lifetime of one hundred years is
generally not possible, even if one has one hundred years, the calculation is that fifty years are wasted in
sleeping, twenty years in childhood and boyhood, and twenty years in invalidity (jara-vyadhi). This leaves
only a few more years, but because of too much attachment to household life, those years are also spent
with no purpose, without God consciousness. Therefore, one should be trained to be a perfect brahmacari
in the beginning of life and then to be perfect in sense control, following the regulative principles, if one
becomes a householder. From household life one is ordered to accept vanaprastha life and go to the forest
and then accept sannyasa. That is the perfection of life. From the very beginning of life, those who are
ajitendriya, who cannot control their senses, are educated only for sense gratification, as we have seen in
the Western countries. Thus the entire duration of a life of even one hundred years is wasted and
misused, and at the time of death one transmigrates to another body, which may not be human. At the
end of one hundred years, one who has not acted as a human being in a life of tapasya (austerity and
penance) must certainly be embodied again in a body like those of cats, dogs and hogs. Therefore this life
of lusty desires and sense gratification is extremely risky.
