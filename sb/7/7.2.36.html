<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tatra ha preta-bandhunam
asrutya paridevitam
aha tan balako bhutva
yamah svayam upagatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--there; ha--certainly; preta-bandhunam--of the friends and relatives of the dead King; asrutya--
hearing; paridevitam--the loud lamentation (so loud that it could be heard from the planet of Yamaraja);
aha--said; tan--unto them (the lamenting queens); balakah--a boy; bhutva--becoming; yamah--Yamaraja,
the superintendent of death; svayam--personally; upagatah--after coming.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While the queens were lamenting for the dead body of the King, their loud cries were heard even from
the abode of Yamaraja. Assuming the body of a boy, Yamaraja personally approached the relatives of the
dead body and advised them as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes the living entity is forced to give up his body and enter another one according to the
judgment of Yamaraja. It is difficult, however, for the conditioned soul to enter another body unless the
present dead body is annihilated through cremation or some other means. The living being has
attachment for the present body and does not want to enter another, and thus in the interim he remains a
ghost. If a living being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamaraja, just to give him relief, will
give him another body. Since the living being in the body of the King had some attachment to his body,
he was hovering as a ghost, and therefore Yamaraja, as a special consideration, approached the lamenting
relatives to instruct them personally. Yamaraja approached them as a child because a child is not
restricted but is granted admittance anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was
speaking philosophy. People are very much interested in hearing philosophy when it is spoken by a child.
