<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
yatra yatra dvija gavo
veda varnasrama-kriyah
tam tam janapadam yata
sandipayata vrscata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatra yatra--wherever; dvijah--the brahmanas; gavah--the protected cows; vedah--the Vedic culture;
varna-asrama--of the Aryan civilization of four varnas and four asramas; kriyah--the activities; tam tam--
that; jana-padam--to the city or town; yata--go; sandipayata--set fire; vrscata--cut down (all the trees).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Immediately go wherever there is good protection for the cows and brahmanas and wherever the Vedas
are studied in terms of the varnasrama principles. Set fire to those places and cut from the roots the trees
there, which are the source of life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The picture of a proper human civilization is indirectly described here. In a perfect human civilization
there must be a class of men fully trained as perfect brahmanas. Similarly, there must be ksatriyas to rule
the country very nicely according to the injunctions of the sastras, and there must be vaisyas who can
protect the cows. The word gavah indicates that cows should be given protection. Because the Vedic
civilization is lost, cows are not protected, but instead indiscriminately killed in slaughterhouses. Such are
the acts of demons. Therefore this is a demoniac civilization. The varnasrama-dharma mentioned here is
essential for human civilization. Unless there is a brahmana to guide, a ksatriya to rule perfectly, and a
perfect vaisya to produce food and protect the cows, how will people live peacefully? It is impossible.
Another point is that trees also should be given protection. During its lifetime, a tree should not be cut
for industrial enterprises. In Kali-yuga, trees are indiscriminately and unnecessarily cut for industry, in
particular for paper mills that manufacture a profuse quantity of paper for the publication of demoniac
propaganda, nonsensical literature, huge quantities of newspapers and many other paper products. This is
a sign of a demoniac civilization. The cutting of trees is prohibited unless necessary for the service of Lord
Visnu. Yajnarthat karmano'nyatra loko'yam karma-bandhanah: "work done as a sacrifice for Lord Visnu
must be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world." But if the paper mills stop
producing paper, one may argue, how can our ISKCON literature be published? The answer is that the
paper mills should manufacture paper only for the publication of ISKCON literature because ISKCON
literature is published for the service of Lord Visnu. This literature clarifies our relationship with Lord
Visnu, and therefore the publication of ISKCON literature is the performance of yajna. Yajnarthat
karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah. Yajna must be performed, as indicated by the superior
authorities. The cutting of trees simply to manufacture paper for the publication of unwanted literature is
the greatest sinful act.
