<h2>Text</h2>
atma-jaya-sutadinam
anyesam sarva-dehinam
yat svartha-kamayor aikyam
dravyadvaitam tad ucyate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atma--of one's self; jaya--wife; suta-adinam--and children; anyesam--of one's relatives, etc.; sarvadehinam--
of all other living entities; yat--whatever; sva-artha-kamayoh--of one's ultimate goal and benefit;
aikyam--oneness; dravya-advaitam--oneness of interest; tat ucyate--it is called.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the ultimate goal and interest of one's self, one's wife, one's children, one's relatives and all other
embodied living beings is one, this is called dravyadvaita, or oneness of interest.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The actual interest of all living entities--indeed, the goal of life--is to return home, back to Godhead.
This is the interest of one's own self, one's wife, one's children, one's disciples and one's friends, relatives,
countrymen and all humanity. The Krsna consciousness movement can give directions for management
by which everyone can partake in Krsna conscious activities and reach the ultimate goal, which is known
as svartha-gatim. This objective of everyone's interest is Visnu, but because people do not know this (na te
viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum), they are making various plans by which to fulfill so many concocted
interests in life. The Krsna consciousness movement is trying to bring everyone to the highest interest.
The process may be differently named, but if the aim is one, people should follow it to achieve the
ultimate goal in life. Unfortunately, people are thinking of different interests, and blind leaders are
misleading them. Everyone is trying to reach the goal of complete happiness materially; because people do
not know what complete happiness is, they are materially diverted toward different interests.
