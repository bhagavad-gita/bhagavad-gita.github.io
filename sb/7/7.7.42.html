<h2>Translation</h2>
In this material world, every materialist desires to achieve happiness and diminish his distress, and
therefore he acts accordingly. Actually, however, one is happy as long as one does not endeavor for
happiness; as soon as one begins his activities for happiness, his conditions of distress begin.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every conditioned soul is bound by the laws of material nature, as described in Bhagavad-gita (prakrteh
kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah). Everyone has achieved a certain type of body given by material
nature according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

yantrarudhani mayaya
"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all
living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy." (Bg. 18.61) The Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, is present in everyone's heart, and as the living entity desires, the
Lord gives him facilities with which to work according to his ambitions in different grades of bodies. The
body is just like an instrument by which the living entity moves according to false desires for happiness
and thus suffers the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease in different standards of life. Everyone
begins his activities with some plan and ambition, but actually, from the beginning of one's plan to the
end, one does not derive any happiness. On the contrary, as soon as one begins acting according to his
plan, his life of distress immediately begins. Therefore, one should not be ambitious to dissipate the
unhappy conditions of life, for one cannot do anything about them. Ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti
manyate. Although one is acting according to false ambitions, he thinks he can improve his material
conditions by his activities. The Vedas enjoin that one should not try to increase happiness or decrease
distress, for this is futile. Tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovidah. One should work for self-realization, not for
economic development, which is impossible to improve. Without endeavor, one can get the amount of
happiness and distress for which he is destined, and one cannot change this. Therefore, it is better to use
one's time for advancement in the spiritual life of Krsna consciousness. One should not waste his valuable
life as a human being. It is better to utilize this life for developing Krsna consciousness, without ambitions
for so-called happiness.
