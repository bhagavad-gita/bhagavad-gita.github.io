<h2>Text</h2>
ity uktas tam vihayendro
devarser manayan vacah
ananta-priya-bhaktyainam
parikramya divam yayau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; uktah--addressed; tam--her; vihaya--releasing; indrah--the King of heaven; deva-rseh--of the
saint Narada Muni; manayan--honoring; vacah--the words; ananta-priya--for one who is very dear to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhaktya--by devotion; enam--this (woman); parikramya--
circumambulating; divam--to the heavenly planets; yayau--returned.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the great saint Narada Muni had thus spoken, King Indra, being respectful to Narada's words,
immediately released my mother. Because of my being a devotee of the Lord, all the demigods
circumambulated her. Then they returned to their celestial kingdom.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although King Indra and the other demigods are exalted personalities, they were so obedient to Narada
Muni that King Indra immediately accepted Narada Muni's words concerning Prahlada Maharaja. This is
called understanding by the parampara system. Indra and the demigods did not know that a great devotee
was in the womb of Kayadhu, the wife of Hiranyakasipu, but they accepted the authoritative statements of
Narada Muni and immediately offered their respects to the devotee by circumambulating the woman in
whose womb he was living. To understand God and the devotee by the parampara system is the process of
knowledge. There is no need to speculate about God and His devotee. One should accept the statements
of a bona fide devotee and thus try to understand.
