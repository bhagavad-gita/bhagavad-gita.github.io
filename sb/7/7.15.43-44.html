<h2>Translation</h2>
In the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and ignorance,
which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige,
insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these
are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also polluted by goodness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The actual aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, but there are many hindrances created by
the three modes of material nature--sometimes by a combination of rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the modes
of passion and ignorance, and sometimes by the mode of goodness. In the material world, even if one is a
philanthropist, a nationalist and a good man according to materialistic estimations, these conceptions of
life form a hindrance to spiritual advancement. How much more of a hindrance, then, are hostility, greed,
illusion, lamentation and too much attachment to material enjoyment? To progress toward the target of
Visnu, which is our real self-interest, one must become very powerful in conquering these various
hindrances or enemies. In other words, one should not be attached to being a good man or a bad man in
this material world.
In this material world, so-called goodness and badness are the same because they consist of the three
modes of material nature. One must transcend this material nature. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies
consist of the three modes of material nature. Therefore Krsna advised Arjuna:
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the self." (Bg. 2.45) Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, urdhvam
gacchanti sattva-sthah: if one becomes a very good person--in other words, if one is in the mode of
goodness--he may be elevated to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, if one is infected by rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, he may remain in this world or go down to the animal kingdom. But all of these
situations are hindrances on the path of spiritual salvation. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
If one is fortunate enough to transcend all this so-called goodness and badness and come to the platform
of devotional service by the mercy of Krsna and the guru, his life becomes successful. In this regard, one
must be very bold so that he can conquer these enemies of Krsna consciousness. Not caring for the good
and bad of this material world, one must boldly propagate Krsna consciousness.
