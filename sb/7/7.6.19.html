<h2>Text</h2>
na hy acyutam prinayato
bahv-ayaso 'suratmajah
atmatvat sarva-bhutanam
siddhatvad iha sarvatah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; hi--indeed; acyutam--the infallible Supreme Personality of Godhead; prinayatah--satisfying;
bahu--much; ayasah--endeavor; asura-atma-jah--O sons of demons; atmatvat--because of being intimately
related as the Supersoul; sarva-bhutanam--of all living entities; siddhatvat--because of being established;
iha--in this world; sarvatah--in all directions, in all times and from all angles of vision.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear sons of demons, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, is the original Supersoul, the
father of all living entities. Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him
under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing
the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One may ask, "One is certainly very attached to family life, but if one gives up family life to be attached
to the service of the Lord, one must undergo the same endeavor and trouble. Therefore, what is the
benefit of taking the trouble to engage in the service of the Lord?" This is not a valid objection. The Lord
asserts in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this
material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father." The Supreme Lord, Narayana, is the seed-giving
father of all living entities because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord
(mamaivamso. .. jiva-bhutah). As there is no difficulty in establishing the intimate relationship between a
father and son, there is no difficulty in reestablishing the natural, intimate relationship between Narayana
and the living entities. Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: if one performs even very
slight devotional service, Narayana is always ready to save one from the greatest danger. The definite
example is Ajamila. Ajamila separated himself from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing
many sinful activities and was condemned by Yamaraja to be very severely punished, but because at the
time of death he chanted the name of Narayana, although he was calling not for the Supreme Lord
Narayana but for his son named Narayana, he was saved from the hands of Yamaraja. Therefore, pleasing
Narayana does not require as much endeavor as pleasing one's family, community and nation. We have
seen important political leaders killed for a slight discrepancy in their behavior. Therefore pleasing one's
society, family, community and nation is extremely difficult. Pleasing Narayana, however, is not at all
difficult; it is very easy.
One's duty is to revive one's relationship with Narayana. A slight endeavor in this direction will make
the attempt successful, whereas one will never be successful in pleasing his so-called family, society and
nation, even if one endeavors to sacrifice his life. The simple endeavor involved in the devotional service
of sravanam kirtanam visnoh, hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord, can make one successful
in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore bestowed His
blessings by saying, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam: "All glories to Sri Krsna sankirtana!" If one
wants to derive the actual benefit from this human form, he must take to the chanting of the holy name of
the Lord.
