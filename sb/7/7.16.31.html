dese sucau same rajan
samsthapyasanam atmanah
sthiram sukham samam tasminn
asitarjv-anga om iti
SYNONYMS
dese--in a place; sucau--very sacred; same--level; rajan--O King; samsthapya--placing; asanam--on the
seat; atmanah--one's self; sthiram--very steady; sukham--comfortably; samam--equipoised; tasmin--on that
sitting place; asita--one should sit down; rju-angah--the body perpendicularly straight; om--The Vedic
mantra pranava; iti--in this way.
TRANSLATION
My dear King, in a sacred and holy place of pilgrimage one should select a place in which to perform
yoga. The place must be level and not too high or low. There one should sit very comfortably, being
steady and equipoised, keeping his body straight, and thus begin chanting the Vedic pranava.
PURPORT
Generally the chanting of om is recommended because in the beginning one cannot understand the
Personality of Godhead. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):
vadanti tat tattva-vidas
tattvam yaj jnanam advayam
brahmeti paramatmeti
bhagavan iti sabdyate
"Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman,
Paramatma or Bhagavan." Unless one is fully convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one has
the tendency to become an impersonalist yogi searching for the Supreme Lord within the core of his heart
(dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah). Here the chanting of omkara is recommended
because in the beginning of transcendental realization, instead of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra,
one may chant omkara (pranava). There is no difference between the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and
omkara because both of them are sound representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. pranavah
sarva-vedesu. In all Vedic literatures, the sound vibration omkara is the beginning. Om namo bhagavate
vasudevaya. The difference between chanting omkara and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra is that the
Hare Krsna mantra may be chanted without consideration of the place or the sitting arrangements
recommended in Bhagavad-gita (6.11):
sucau dese pratisthapya
sthiram asanam atmanah
naty-ucchritam natinicam
cailajina-kusottaram
"To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa grass on the ground and then
cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be
situated in a sacred place." The Hare Krsna mantra may be chanted by anyone, without consideration of
the place or how one sits. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has openly declared, niyamitah smarane na kalah. In
chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra there are no particular injunctions regarding one's sitting place.
The injunction niyamitah smarane na kalah includes desa, kala and patra--place, time and the individual.
Therefore anyone may chant the Hare Krsna mantra, without consideration of the time and place.
Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to find a suitable place according to the
recommendations of Bhagavad-gita. The Hare Krsna maha-mantra, however, may be chanted at any place
and any time, and this will bring results very quickly. Yet even while chanting the Hare Krsna mantra one
may observe regulative principles. Thus while sitting and chanting one may keep his body straight, and
this will help one in the chanting process; otherwise one may feel sleepy.

sva-nasagra-niriksanah

SYNONYMS
prana--incoming breath; apanau--outgoing breath; sannirundhyat--should stop; pura-kumbhakarecakaih--
by inhaling, exhaling and holding, which are technically known as puraka, kumbhaka and
recaka; yavat--so long; manah--the mind; tyajet--should give up; kaman--all material desires; sva--one's
own; nasa-agra--the tip of the nose; niriksanah--looking at; yatah yatah--from whatever and wherever;
nihsarati--withdraws; manah--the mind; kama-hatam--being defeated by lusty desires; bhramat--
wandering; tatah tatah--from here and there; upahrtya--after bringing it back; hrdi--within the core of the
heart; rundhyat--should arrest (the mind); sanaih--gradually, by practice; budhah--a learned yogi.
TRANSLATION
While continuously staring at the tip of the nose, a learned yogi practices the breathing exercises
through the technical means known as puraka, kumbhaka and recaka--controlling inhalation and
exhalation and then stopping them both. In this way the yogi restricts his mind from material attachments
and gives up all mental desires. As soon as the mind, being defeated by lusty desires, drifts toward feelings
of sense gratification, the yogi should immediately bring it back and arrest it within the core of his heart.
PURPORT
The practice of yoga is concisely explained herein. When this practice of yoga is perfect, one sees the
Supersoul, the Paramatma feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, within the core of one's heart.
However, in Bhagavad-gita (6.47) the Supreme Lord says:
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." A devotee can immediately
become a perfect yogi because he practices keeping Krsna constantly within the core of his heart. This is
another way to practice yoga easily. The Lord says:
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
"Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me." (Bg.
18.65) If one practices devotional service by always keeping Krsna within the core of his heart (manmanah),
he immediately becomes a first-class yogi. Furthermore, keeping Krsna within the mind is not a
difficult task for the devotee. For an ordinary man in the bodily concept of life, the practice of yoga may
be helpful, but one who immediately takes to devotional service can immediately become a perfect yogi
without difficulty.
