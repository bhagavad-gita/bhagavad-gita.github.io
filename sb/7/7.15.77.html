<h2>Text</h2>
na yasya saksad bhava-padmajadibhi
rupam dhiya vastutayopavarnitam
maunena bhaktyopasamena pujitah
prasidatam esa sa satvatam patih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; yasya--of whom (Lord Sri Krsna); saksat--directly; bhava--by Lord Siva; padma-ja-adibhih--Lord
Brahma and others; rupam--the form; dhiya--by meditation; vastutaya--factually; upavarnitam--could be
explained; maunena--by silence; bhaktya--by devotional service; upasamena--by finishing all material
activities; pujitah--one who is so worshiped; prasidatam--may be pleased with us; esah--this; sah--the
same Personality of Godhead; satvatam--of the devotees; patih--who is the maintainer, master and guide.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Present here now is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead whose true form cannot be understood
even by such great personalities as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. He is realized by devotees because of their
unflinching surrender. May that same Personality of Godhead, who is the maintainer of His devotees and
who is worshiped by silence, by devotional service and by cessation of material activities, be pleased with
us.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Krsna is not properly understood even by such exalted personalities as Lord Siva and Lord
Brahma, what to speak of ordinary men, but by His causeless mercy He bestows the benediction of
devotion upon His devotees, who can thus understand Krsna as He is. Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas
casmi tattvatah. No one within this universe can understand Krsna in truth, but if one engages in
devotional service one can understand Him perfectly well. This is also confirmed by the Lord in the
Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (7.1):
mayy asakta-manah partha
yogam yunjan mad-asrayah
asamsayam samagram mam
yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu
"Now, hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind
attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." Lord Krsna Himself teaches how one can
understand Him perfectly well, without a doubt. Not only the Pandavas but everyone who sincerely
accepts the instructions of Krsna can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is. After
instructing Yudhisthira Maharaja, Narada Muni prays for the Lord's blessings that He be pleased with
everyone and that everyone become perfect in God consciousness and return home, back to Godhead.
