<h2>Translation</h2>
Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
the cause of all causes, the original source of everything. The Lord is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual
qualities. For devotees, therefore, who are transcendental to the modes of material nature, what is the use
of following the principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, which
are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the modes of nature? We devotees always glorify
the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, kama, artha and
moksa.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In an advanced civilization, people are eager to be religious, to be economically well situated, to satisfy
their senses to the fullest extent, and at last to attain liberation. However, these are not to be magnified as
desirable. Indeed, for a devotee these are all very easily available. Bilvamangala Thakura said, muktih
svayam mukulitanjali sevate 'sman dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksah. Liberation always stands
at the door of a devotee, ready to carry out his orders. Material advancement in religion, economic
development, sense gratification and liberation simply wait to serve a devotee at the first opportunity. A
devotee is already in a transcendental position; he does not need further qualifications to be liberated. As
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26), sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate: a devotee is
transcendental to the actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature because he is situated on
the Brahman platform.
Prahlada Maharaja said, agunena ca kanksitena: if one is engaged in the transcendental loving service of
the lotus feet of the Lord, he does not need anything in terms of dharma, artha, kama or moksa. In
Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, in the beginning of the transcendental literature, it is said, dharmah
projjhita-kaitavo 'tra. Dharma, artha, kama and moksa are kaitava--false and unnecessary. Nirmatsaranam,
persons who are completely transcendental to the material activities of separateness, who make no
distinction between "mine" and "yours," but who simply engage in the devotional service of the Lord, are
actually fit to accept bhagavata-dharma (dharman bhagavatan iha). Because they are nirmatsara, not
jealous of anyone, they want to make others devotees, even their enemies. In this regard, Srila
Madhvacarya remarks, kanksate moksa-gam api sukham nakanksato yatha. Devotees are not desirous of
any material happiness, including the happiness derived from liberation. This is called anyabhilasitasunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam. Karmis desire material happiness, and jnanis desire liberation, but a
devotee does not desire anything; he is simply satisfied by rendering transcendental loving service at the
lotus feet of the Lord and glorifying Him everywhere by preaching, which is his life and soul.
