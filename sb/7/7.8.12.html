<h2>Text</h2>
yas tvaya manda-bhagyokto
mad-anyo jagad-isvarah
kvasau yadi sa sarvatra
kasmat stambhe na drsyate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--the one who; tvaya--by you; manda-bhagya--O unfortunate one; uktah--described; mat-anyah--
besides me; jagat-isvarah--the supreme controller of the universe; kva--where; asau--that one; yadi--if;
sah--He; sarvatra--everywhere (all-pervading); kasmat--why; stambhe--in the pillar before me; na drsyate--
not seen.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme
being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is
He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Demons sometimes declare to a devotee that they cannot accept the existence of God because they
cannot see Him. But what the demon does not know is stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita
(7.25): naham prakasah sarvasya yogamaya-samavrtah. "I am never manifest to the foolish and
unintelligent. For them I am covered by yogamaya." The Lord is open to being seen by devotees, but
nondevotees cannot see Him. The qualification for seeing God is stated in Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti. A devotee who has
developed a genuine love for Krsna can always see Him everywhere, whereas a demon, not having a clear
understanding of the Supreme Lord, cannot see Him. When Hiranyakasipu was threatening to kill
Prahlada Maharaja, Prahlada certainly saw the column standing before him and his father, and he saw that
the Lord was present in the pillar to encourage him not to fear his demoniac father's words. The Lord was
present to protect him. Hiranyakasipu marked Prahlada's observation and asked him, "Where is your
God?" Prahlada Maharaja replied, "He is everywhere." Then Hiranyakasipu asked, "Why is He not in this
pillar before me?" Thus in all circumstances the devotee can always see the Supreme Lord, whereas the
nondevotee cannot.
Prahlada Maharaja has here been addressed by his father as "the most unfortunate." Hiranyakasipu
thought himself extremely fortunate because he possessed the property of the universe. Prahlada
Maharaja, his legitimate son, was to have inherited this vast property, but because of his impudence, he
was going to die at his father's hands. Therefore the demoniac father considered Prahlada the most
unfortunate because Prahlada would not be able to inherit his property. Hiranyakasipu did not know that
Prahlada Maharaja was the most fortunate person within the three worlds because Prahlada was protected
by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such are the misunderstandings of demons. They do not know
that a devotee is protected by the Lord in all circumstances (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah
pranasyati).
