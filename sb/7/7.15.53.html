<h2>Translation</h2>
The mind is always agitated by waves of acceptance and rejection. Therefore all the activities of the
senses should be offered into the mind, which should be offered into one's words. Then one's words
should be offered into the aggregate of all alphabets, which should be offered into the concise form
omkara. Omkara should be offered into the point bindu, bindu into the vibration of sound, and that
vibration into the life air. Then the living entity, who is all that remains, should be placed in Brahman, the
Supreme. This is the process of sacrifice.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The mind is always agitated by acceptance and rejection, which are compared to mental waves that are
constantly tossing. The living entity is floating in the waves of material existence because of his
forgetfulness. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung in his Gitavali: miche mayara vase, yaccha
bhese', khaccha habudubu, bhai. "My dear mind, under the influence of maya you are being carried away
by the waves of rejection and acceptance. Simply take shelter of Krsna." Jiva krsna-dasa, ei visvasa, karle
ta' ara duhkha nai: if we simply regard the lotus feet of Krsna as our ultimate shelter, we shall be saved
from all these waves of maya, which are variously exhibited as mental and sensual activities and the
agitation of rejection and acceptance. Krsna instructs in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." Therefore if we simply place ourselves at the lotus feet of Krsna by taking to Krsna
consciousness and keeping always in touch with Him by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, we need not
take much trouble in arranging to return to the spiritual world. By the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
this is very easy.
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
