<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekada--once upon a time; asura-rat--the Emperor of the asuras; putram--his son; ankam--on the lap;
aropya--placing; pandava--O Maharaja Yudhisthira; papraccha--inquired; kathyatam--let it be told; vatsa--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Yudhisthira, once upon a time the King of the demons, Hiranyakasipu, took his son
Prahlada on his lap and very affectionately inquired: My dear son, please let me know what you think is
the best of all the subjects you have studied from your teachers.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu did not ask his young son anything that would be very difficult for him to answer;
instead, he gave the boy a chance to speak plainly about whatever he thought might be best. Prahlada
Maharaja, of course, being a perfect devotee, knew everything and could say what the best part of life is.
In the Vedas it is said, yasmin vijnate samam evam vijnatam bhavati: if one properly understands God, he
can understand any subject matter very nicely. Sometimes we have to challenge big scientists and
philosophers, but by the grace of Krsna we emerge successful. It is impossible, practically speaking, for
ordinary men to challenge scientists or philosophers concerning genuine knowledge, but a devotee can
challenge them because the best of everything is known to a devotee by the grace of Krsna. As confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):
tesam evanukampartham
aham ajnana-jam tamah
nasayamy atma-bhava-stho
jnana-dipena bhasvata
Krsna, who is situated in the core of everyone's heart as the Supersoul, dissipates all the ignorance from
the heart of a devotee. As a special favor, He enlightens the devotee with all knowledge by putting before
him the torch of light. Prahlada Maharaja, therefore, knew the best of knowledge, and when his father
inquired from him, Prahlada gave him that knowledge. Prahlada Maharaja was able to solve the most
difficult parts of problems because of his advanced Krsna consciousness. Therefore he replied as follows.
