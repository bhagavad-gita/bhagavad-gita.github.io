<h2>Text</h2>
bhogena punyam kusalena papam
kalevaram kala-javena hitva
kirtim visuddham sura-loka-gitam
vitaya mam esyasi mukta-bandhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhogena--by feelings of material happiness; punyam--pious activities or their results; kusalena--by
acting piously (devotional service is the best of all pious activities); papam--all kinds of reactions to
impious activities; kalevaram--the material body; kala-javena--by the most powerful time factor; hitva--
giving up; kirtim--reputation; visuddham--transcendental or fully purified; sura-loka-gitam--praised even
in the heavenly planets; vitaya--spreading all through the universe; mam--unto Me; esyasi--you will come
back; mukta-bandhah--being liberated from all bondage.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Prahlada, while you are in this material world you will exhaust all the reactions of pious
activity by feeling happiness, and by acting piously you will neutralize impious activity. Because of the
powerful time factor, you will give up your body, but the glories of your activities will be sung in the
upper planetary systems, and being fully freed from all bondage, you will return home, back to Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says: evam prahladasyamsena sadhana-siddhatvam nityasiddhatvam
ca naradadivaj jneyam. There are two classes of devotees--the sadhana-siddha and the nityasiddha.
Prahlada Maharaja is a mixed siddha; that is, he is perfect partly because of executing devotional
service and partly because of eternal perfection. Thus he is compared to such devotees as Narada.
Formerly, Narada Muni was the son of a maidservant, and therefore in his next birth he attained
perfection (sadhana-siddhi) because of having executed devotional service. Yet he is also a nitya-siddha
because he never forgets the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The word kusalena is very important. One should live in the material world very expertly. The material
world is known as the world of duality because one sometimes has to act impiously and sometimes has to
act piously. Although one does not want to act impiously, the world is so fashioned that there is always
danger (padam padam yad vipadam). Thus even when performing devotional service a devotee has to
create many enemies. Prahlada Maharaja himself had experience of this, for even his father became his
enemy. A devotee should expertly manage to think always of the Supreme Lord so that the reactions of
suffering cannot touch him. This is the expert management of papa-punya--pious and impious activities.
An exalted devotee like Prahlada Maharaja is jivan-mukta; he is liberated even in this very life in the
material body.
