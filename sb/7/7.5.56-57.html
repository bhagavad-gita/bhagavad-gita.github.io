<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Yudhisthira, all the children were very much affectionate and respectful to Prahlada
Maharaja, and because of their tender age they were not so polluted by the instructions and actions of
their teachers, who were attached to condemned duality and bodily comfort. Thus the boys surrounded
Prahlada Maharaja, giving up their playthings, and sat down to hear him. Their hearts and eyes being
fixed upon him, they looked at him with great earnestness. Prahlada Maharaja, although born in a demon
family, was an exalted devotee, and he desired their welfare. Thus he began instructing them about the
futility of materialistic life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words bala adusita-dhiyah indicate that the children, being of a tender age, were not as polluted by
materialistic life as their fathers. Prahlada Maharaja, therefore, taking advantage of the innocence of his
class friends, began teaching them about the importance of spiritual life and the insignificance of
materialistic life. Although the teachers Sanda and Amarka were instructing all the boys in the
materialistic life of religion, economic development and sense gratification, the boys were not much
polluted. Therefore, with great attention they wanted to hear from Prahlada Maharaja about Krsna
consciousness. In our Krsna consciousness movement, the guru-kula plays an extremely important part in
our activities because right from childhood the boys at the guru-kula are instructed about Krsna
consciousness. Thus they become steady within the cores of their hearts, and there is very little possibility
that they will be conquered by the modes of material nature when they are older.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Prahlada Maharaja, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu."
Chapter Six
Prahlada Instructs His Demoniac Schoolmates
This chapter describes Prahlada Maharaja's instructions to his class friends. In speaking to his friends,
who were all sons of demons, Prahlada Maharaja stressed that every living entity, especially in human
society, must be interested in spiritual realization from the very beginning of life. When human beings are
children, they should be taught that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the worshipable Deity for
everyone. One should not be very much interested in material enjoyment; instead, one should be satisfied
with whatever material profits are easily obtainable, and because the duration of one's life is very short,
one should utilize every moment for spiritual advancement. One may wrongly think, "In the beginning of
our lives let us enjoy material facilities, and in old age we may become Krsna conscious." Such
materialistic thoughts are always useless because in old age one cannot be trained in the spiritual way of
life. Therefore, from the very beginning of life, one should engage in devotional service (sravanam
kirtanam visnoh). This is the duty of all living entities. Material education is infected by the three modes
of nature, but spiritual education, for which there is a great need in human society, is transcendental.
Prahlada Maharaja disclosed the secret of how he had received instructions from Narada Muni. By
accepting the lotus feet of Prahlada Maharaja, who is in the parampara succession, one will be able to
understand the mode of spiritual life. In accepting this mode of activity, there is no need for material
qualifications.
After Prahlada Maharaja's class friends had listened to Prahlada Maharaja, they inquired how he had
become so learned and advanced. In this way the chapter ends.
