<h2>Text</h2>
sri-rudra uvaca
kopa-kalo yugantas te
hato 'yam asuro 'lpakah
tat-sutam pahy upasrtam
bhaktam te bhakta-vatsala
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-rudrah uvaca--Lord Siva offered his prayer; kopa-kalah--the right time for Your anger (for the
purpose of annihilating the universe); yuga-antah--the end of the millennium; te--by You; hatah--killed;
ayam--this; asurah--great demon; alpakah--very insignificant; tat-sutam--his son (Prahlada Maharaja);
pahi--just protect; upasrtam--who is surrendered and standing nearby; bhaktam--devotee; te--of Your
Lordship; bhakta-vatsala--O my Lord, who are so affectionate to Your devotee.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva said: The end of the millennium is the time for Your anger. Now that this insignificant demon
Hiranyakasipu has been killed, O my Lord, who are naturally affectionate to Your devotee, kindly protect
his son Prahlada Maharaja, who is standing nearby as Your fully surrendered devotee.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the creator of the material world. There are three processes in
creation--namely creation, maintenance and finally annihilation. During the period of annihilation, at the
end of each millennium, the Lord becomes angry, and the part of anger is played by Lord Siva, who is
therefore called Rudra. When the Lord appeared in great anger to kill Hiranyakasipu, everyone was
extremely afraid of the Lord's attitude, but Lord Siva, knowing very well that the Lord's anger is also His
lila, was not afraid. Lord Siva knew that he would have to play the part of anger for the Lord. Kala means
Lord Siva (Bhairava), and kopa refers to the Lord's anger. These words, combined together as kopa-kala,
refer to the end of each millennium. Actually the Lord is always affectionate toward His devotees, even
though He may appear very angry. Because He is avyayatma--because He never falls down--even when
angry the Lord is affectionate toward His devotees. Therefore Lord Siva reminded the Lord to act like an
affectionate father toward Prahlada Maharaja, who was standing by the Lord's side as an exalted, fully
surrendered devotee.
