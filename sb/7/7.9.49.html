<h2>Text</h2>
naite guna na gunino mahad-adayo ye
sarve manah prabhrtayah sahadeva-martyah
ady-antavanta urugaya vidanti hi tvam
evam vimrsya sudhiyo viramanti sabdat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--neither; ete--all these; gunah--three qualities of material nature; na--nor; guninah--the
predominating deities of the three modes of material nature (namely Lord Brahma, the predominating
deity of passion, and Lord Siva, the predominating deity of ignorance); mahat-adayah--the five elements,
the senses and the sense objects; ye--those which; sarve--all; manah--the mind; prabhrtayah--and so on;
saha-deva-martyah--with the demigods and the mortal human beings; adi-anta-vantah--who all have a
beginning and end; urugaya--O Supreme Lord, who are glorified by all saintly persons; vidanti--
understand; hi--indeed; tvam--Your Lordship; evam--thus; vimrsya--considering; sudhiyah--all wise men;
viramanti--cease; sabdat--from studying or understanding the Vedas.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Neither the three modes of material nature [sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna], nor the
predominating deities controlling these three modes, nor the five gross elements, nor the mind, nor the
demigods nor the human beings can understand Your Lordship, for they are all subjected to birth and
annihilation. Considering this, the spiritually advanced have taken to devotional service. Such wise men
hardly bother with Vedic study. Instead, they engage themselves in practical devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in several places, bhaktya mam abhijanati: only by devotional service can the Supreme Lord be
understood. The intelligent person, the devotee, does not bother much about the practices mentioned in
text 46 (mauna-vrata-sruta-tapo-'dhyayana-sva-dharma). After understanding the Supreme Lord through
devotional service, such devotees are no longer interested in studies of the Vedas. Indeed, this is
confirmed in the Vedas also. The Vedas say, kim artha vayam adhyesyamahe kim artha vayam
vaksyamahe. What is the use of studying so many Vedic literatures? What is the use of explaining them in
different ways? Vayam vaksyamahe. No one needs to study any more Vedic literatures, nor does anyone
need to describe them by philosophical speculation. Bhagavad-gita (2.52) also says:
yada te moha-kalilam
buddhir vyatitarisyati
tada gantasi nirvedam
srotavyasya srutasya ca
When one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing devotional service, one ceases
the practice of studying the Vedic literature. Elsewhere it is said, aradhito yadi haris tapasa tatah kim. If
one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engage in His service, there is no more need
of severe austerities, penances and so on. However, if after performing severe austerities and penances one
does not understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such practices are useless.
