<h2>Translation</h2>
The natural products created by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be utilized to maintain the
bodies and souls of all living entities. The necessities of life are of three types: those produced from the
sky [from rainfall], from the earth [from the mines, the seas or the fields], and from the atmosphere [that
which is obtained suddenly and unexpectedly].
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We living entities in different forms are all children of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as
confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad-yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
"It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this
material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father." The Supreme Lord, Krsna, is the father of all living
entities in different species and forms. One who is intelligent can see that all living entities in the
8,400,000 bodily forms are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are His sons. Everything
within the material and spiritual worlds is the property of the Supreme Lord (isavasyam idam sarvam),
and therefore everything has a relationship with Him. Srila Rupa Gosvami says in this regard:
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
"One who rejects anything without knowledge of its relationship to Krsna is incomplete in his
renunciation." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.256) Although Mayavadi philosophers say that the material
creation is false, actually it is not false; it is factual, but the idea that everything belongs to human society
is false. Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for everything is created by Him. All
living entities, being the Lord's sons, His eternal parts and parcels, have the right to use their father's
property by nature's arrangement. As stated in the Upanisads, tena tyaktena bhunjitha ma grdhah kasya
svid dhanam. Everyone should be satisfied with the things allotted him by the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; no one should encroach upon another's rights or property.
In Bhagavad-gita it is said:
annad bhavanti bhutani
parjanyad anna-sambhavah
yajnad bhavati parjanyo
yajnah karma-samudbhavah
"All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by
performance of yajna [sacrifice], and yajna is born of prescribed duties." (Bg. 3.14) When food grains are
sufficiently produced, both animals and human beings can be nourished without difficulty for their
maintenance. This is nature's arrangement. prakrteh kriyamana-ni gunaih karmani sarvasah. Everyone is
acting under the influence of material nature, and only fools think they can improve upon what God has
created. The householders are specifically responsible for seeing that the laws of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead are maintained, without fighting between men, communities, societies or nations. Human
society should properly utilize the gifts of God, especially the food grains that grow because of rain falling
from the sky. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, yajnad bhavati parjanyah. So that rainfall will be regulated,
humanity should perform yajnas, sacrifices. Yajnas were previously performed with offerings of oblations
of ghee and food grains, but in this age, of course, this is no longer possible, for the production of ghee
and food grains has diminished because of the sinful life of human society. However, people should take
to Krsna consciousness and chant the Hare Krsna mantra, as recommended in the sastras (yajnaih
sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah). If people throughout the world take to the Krsna
consciousness movement and chant the easy sound vibration of the transcendental name and fame of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be no scarcity of rainfall; consequently food grains, fruits and
flowers will be properly produced, and all the necessities of life will be easily obtained. Grhasthas, or
householders, should take the responsibility for organizing such natural production. It is therefore said,
tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovidah. An intelligent person should try to spread Krsna consciousness through
the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, and all the necessities of life will automatically follow.
