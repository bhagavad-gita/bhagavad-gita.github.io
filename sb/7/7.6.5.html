<h2>Text</h2>
tato yateta kusalah
ksemaya bhavam asritah
sariram paurusam yavan
na vipadyeta puskalam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--therefore; yateta--should endeavor; kusalah--an intelligent man interested in the ultimate goal of
life; ksemaya--for the real benefit of life, or for liberation from material bondage; bhavam asritah--who is
in material existence; sariram--the body; paurusam--human; yavat--as long as; na--not; vipadyeta--fails;
puskalam--stout and strong.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, while in material existence [bhavam asritah], a person fully competent to distinguish wrong
from right must endeavor to achieve the highest goal of life as long as the body is stout and strong and is
not embarrassed by dwindling.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Prahlada Maharaja at the beginning of this chapter, kaumara acaret prajnah. The word
prajna refers to one who is experienced and who can distinguish right from wrong. Such a person should
not waste his energy and valuable human lifetime simply working like a cat or dog to develop his
economic condition.
For one word in this verse there are two readings--bhavam asritah and bhayam asritah--but accepting
the meaning of either of them will bring one to the same conclusion. Bhayam asritah indicates that the
materialistic way of life is always fearful because at every step there is danger. Materialistic life is full of
anxieties and fear (bhayam). Similarly, accepting the reading bhavam asritah, the word bhavam refers to
unnecessary trouble and problems. For want of Krsna consciousness, one is put into bhavam, being
perpetually embarrassed by birth, death, old age and disease. Thus one is surely full of anxieties.
Human society should be divided into a social system of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, but
everyone can engage in devotional service. If one wants to live without devotional service, his status as a
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra certainly has no meaning. It is said, sthanad bhrastah patanty adhah:
whether one is in a higher or lower division, one certainly falls down for want of Krsna consciousness. A
sane man, therefore, is always fearful of falling from his position. This is a regulative principle. One
should not fall from his exalted position. The highest goal of life can be achieved as long as one's body is
stout and strong. We should therefore live in such a way that we keep ourselves always healthy and strong
in mind and intelligence so that we can distinguish the goal of life from a life full of problems. A
thoughtful man must act in this way, learning to distinguish right from wrong, and thus attain the goal of
life.
