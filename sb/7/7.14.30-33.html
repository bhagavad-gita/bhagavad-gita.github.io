<h2>Translation</h2>
The sacred lakes like Puskara and places where saintly persons live, like Kuruksetra, Gaya, Prayaga,
Pulahasrama, Naimisaranya, the banks of the Phalgu River, Setubandha, Prabhasa, Dvaraka, Varanasi,
Mathura, Pampa, Bindu-sarovara, Badarikasrama [Narayanasrama], the places where the Nanda River
flows, the places where Lord Ramacandra and mother Sita took shelter, such as Citrakuta, and also the
hilly tracts of land known as Mahendra and Malaya--all of these are to be considered most pious and
sacred. Similarly, places outside India where there are centers of the Krsna consciousness movement and
where Radha-Krsna Deities are worshiped must all be visited and worshiped by those who want to be
spiritually advanced. One who intends to advance in spiritual life may visit all these places and perform
ritualistic ceremonies to get results a thousand times better than the results of the same activities
performed in any other place.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In these verses and in verse twenty-nine, stress is given to one point: harer arcasritas ca ye or harer arca.
In other words, any place where the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by
devotees is most significant. The Krsna consciousness movement is giving the population of the entire
world a chance to take advantage of Krsna consciousness through the ISKCON centers, where one may
perform Deity worship and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and in this way obtain results with
effectiveness increased a thousand times. This constitutes the best welfare activity for human society. This
was Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission as it was predicted by Him in the Caitanya-bhagavata (Antya
4.126):
prthivite ache yata nagaradi-grama
sarvatra pracara haibe mora nama
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted the Hare Krsna movement, with installed Deities, to spread to every
village and town in the world, so that everyone in the world might take advantage of this movement and
become all-auspicious in spiritual life. Without spiritual life, nothing is auspicious. Moghasa moghakarmano
mogha jnana vicetasah (Bg. 9.12). No one can become successful in fruitive activities or
speculative knowledge without being Krsna conscious. As recommended in the sastras, everyone should
be very eagerly interested in taking part in the Krsna consciousness movement and understanding the
value of spiritual life.
