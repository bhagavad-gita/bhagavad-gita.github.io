<h2>Translation</h2>
Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving. Grant me, further, that I not be
killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you
in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no
rival. Give me sole lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories
obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the
practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma obtained his supreme position due to long austerities and penances, mystic yoga,
meditation and so on. Hiranyakasipu wanted a similar position. The ordinary powers achieved by mystic
yoga, austerities and other processes are sometimes vanquished, but the powers obtained by the mercy of
the Lord are never vanquished. Hiranyakasipu, therefore, wanted a benediction that would never be
vanquished.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Hiranyakasipu's Plan to Become Immortal."
Chapter Four
Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes the Universe
This chapter fully describes how Hiranyakasipu obtained power from Lord Brahma and misused it by
harassing all the living entities within this universe.
By severe austerities, Hiranyakasipu satisfied Lord Brahma and obtained the benedictions he desired.
After he received these benedictions, his body, which had been almost entirely consumed, was revived
with full beauty and a luster like gold. Nonetheless, he continued to be envious of Lord Visnu, unable to
forget Lord Visnu's having killed his brother. Hiranyakasipu conquered everyone in the ten directions and
the three worlds and brought all living entities, both demigods and asuras, under his control. Becoming
the master of all places, including the residence of Indra, whom he had driven out, he began enjoying life
in great luxury and thus became mad. All the demigods but Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva came
under his control and began serving him, but despite all his material power he was dissatisfied because he
was always puffed up, proud of transgressing the Vedic regulations. All the brahmanas were dissatisfied
with him, and they cursed him with determination. Eventually, all the living entities within the universe,
represented by the demigods and sages, prayed to the Supreme Lord for relief from Hiranyakasipu's rule.
Lord Visnu informed the demigods that they and the other living entities would be saved from the
fearful conditions created by Hiranyakasipu. Since Hiranyakasipu was the oppressor of all the demigods,
the followers of the Vedas, the cows, the brahmanas and the religious, saintly persons, and since he was
envious of the Supreme Lord, he would naturally be killed very soon. Hiranyakasipu's last exploit would
be to torment his own son Prahlada, who was a maha-bhagavata, an exalted Vaisnava. Then his life would
end. When the demigods were thus reassured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone was
satisfied, knowing that the miseries inflicted upon them by Hiranyakasipu would come to an end.
Finally, Narada Muni describes the characteristics of Prahlada Maharaja, the son of Hiranyakasipu, and
describes how his father envied his own qualified son. In this way the chapter ends.
