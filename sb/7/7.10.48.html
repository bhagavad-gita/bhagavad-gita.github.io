<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni continued: My dear Maharaja Yudhisthira, all of you [the Pandavas] are extremely
fortunate, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, lives in your palace just like a human being.
Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After hearing about the activities of Prahlada Maharaja, a pure devotee should be very anxious to follow
in his footsteps, but such a devotee might be disappointed, thinking that not every devotee can come to
the standard of Prahlada Maharaja. This is the nature of a pure devotee; he always thinks himself to be the
lowest, to be incompetent and unqualified. Thus after hearing the narration of Prahlada Maharaja's
activities, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was on the same standard of devotional service as Prahlada, might
have been thinking of his own humble position. Narada Muni, however, could understand Maharaja
Yudhisthira's mind, and therefore he immediately encouraged him by saying that the Pandavas were not
less fortunate; they were as good as Prahlada Maharaja because although Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared for
Prahlada, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His original form as Krsna was always living with the
Pandavas. Although the Pandavas, because of the influence of Krsna's yogamaya, could not think of their
fortunate position, every saintly person, including the great sage Narada, could understand it, and
therefore they constantly visited Maharaja Yudhisthira.
Any pure devotee who is constantly conscious of Krsna is naturally very fortunate. The word nr-loke,
meaning "within the material world," indicates that before the Pandavas there had been many, many
devotees, such as the descendants of the Yadu dynasty and Vasistha, Marici, Kasyapa, Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva, who were all extremely fortunate. The Pandavas, however, were better than all of them because
Krsna Himself lived with them constantly. Narada Muni therefore specifically mentioned that within this
material world (nr-loke) the Pandavas were the most fortunate.
