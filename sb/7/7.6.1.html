<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-prahradah uvaca--Prahlada Maharaja said; kaumarah--in the tender age of childhood; acaret--should
practice; prajnah--one who is intelligent; dharman--occupational duties; bhagavatan--which are
devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead; iha--in this life; durlabham--very rarely
obtained; manusam--human; janma--birth; tat--that; api--even; adhruvam--impermanent, temporary;
artha-dam--full of meaning.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja said: One who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of body from the
very beginning of life--in other words, from the tender age of childhood--to practice the activities of
devotional service, giving up all other engagements. The human body is most rarely achieved, and
although temporary like other bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional
service. Even a slight amount of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole purpose of Vedic civilization and of reading the Vedas is to attain the perfect stage of
devotional service in the human form of life. According to the Vedic system, therefore, from the very
beginning of life the brahmacarya system is introduced so that from one's very childhood--from the age of
five years--one can practice modifying one's human activities so as to engage perfectly in devotional
service. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.40), svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: "Even
a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear." Modern
civilization, not referring to the verdicts of Vedic literature, is so cruel to the members of human society
that instead of teaching children to become brahmacaris, it teaches mothers to kill their children even in
the womb, on the plea of curbing the increase of population. And if by chance a child is saved, he is
educated only for sense gratification. Gradually, throughout the entire world, human society is losing
interest in the perfection of life. Indeed, men are living like cats and dogs, spoiling the duration of their
human lives by actually preparing to transmigrate again to the degraded species among the 8,400,000
forms of life. The Krsna consciousness movement is anxious to serve human society by teaching people to
perform devotional service, which can save a human being from being degraded again to animal life. As
already stated by Prahlada Maharaja, bhagavata-dharma consists of sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam
pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. In all the schools, colleges and
universities, and at home, all children and youths should be taught to hear about the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. In other words, they should be taught to hear the instructions of Bhagavad-gita, to put them
into practice in their lives, and thus to become strong in devotional service, free from fear of being
degraded to animal life. Following bhagavata-dharma has been made extremely easy in this age of Kali.
The sastra says:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
One need only chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra. Everyone engaged in the practice of chanting the
Hare Krsna maha-mantra will be completely cleansed, from the core of his heart, and be saved from the
cycle of birth and death.
