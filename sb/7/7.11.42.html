esa brahmanya-devasya
krsnasya ca mahatmanah
avatara-katha punya
vadho yatradi-daityayoh
SYNONYMS
esa--all this; brahmanya-devasya--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is worshiped by all
brahmanas; krsnasya--of Krsna, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead; ca--also; maha-atmanah--
the Supersoul; avatara-katha--narrations about His incarnations; punya--pious, purifying; vadhah--killing;
yatra--wherein; adi--in the beginning of the millennium; daityayoh--of the demons (Hiranyaksa and
Hiranyakasipu).
TRANSLATION
In this narration about Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, various expansions or incarnations
of the Lord have been described, and the killing of the two demons Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu has
also been described.
PURPORT
Avataras, or incarnations, are expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead--Krsna, Govinda.
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person--nondual,
infallible, and without beginning. Although He expands into unlimited forms, He is still the original, and
although He is the oldest person, He always appears as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful and allknowing
forms of the Lord cannot be understood by the academic wisdom of the Vedas, but they are
always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees." (Brahma-samhita 5.33) The Brahma-samhita describes the
avataras. Indeed, all the avataras are described in the authentic scriptures. No one can become an avatara,
or incarnation, although this has become fashionable in the age of Kali. The avataras are described in the
authentic scriptures (sastras), and therefore before one risks accepting a pretender as an avatara, one
should refer to the sastras. The sastras say everywhere that Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead
and that He has innumerable avataras, or incarnations. Elsewhere in the Brahma-samhita it is said,
ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan: Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha and many others are consecutive
expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After Krsna comes Balarama, after Balarama is
Sankarsana, then Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Narayana and then the purusa-avataras--Maha-Visnu,
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu. All of them are avataras.
One must hear about the avataras. Narrations about such avataras are called avatara-katha, the
narrations of Krsna's expansions. Hearing and chanting these narrations is completely pious. Srnvatam
sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah. One who hears and chants can become punya, purified of
material contamination.
Whenever there are references to the avataras, religious principles are established, and demons who are
against Krsna are killed. The Krsna consciousness movement is spreading all over the world with two
aims--to establish Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to kill all the pretenders who falsely
present themselves as avataras. The preachers of the Krsna consciousness movement must carry this
conviction very carefully within their hearts and kill the demons who in many tactful ways vilify the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. If we take shelter of Nrsimhadeva and Prahlada Maharaja, it will
be easier to kill the demons who are against Krsna and to thus reestablish Krsna's supremacy. Krsnas tu
bhagavan svayam: Krsna is the Supreme Lord, the original Lord. Prahlada Maharaja is our guru, and
Krsna is our worshipable God. As advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, guru-krsna-prasade paya bhaktilata-
bija. If we can be successful in getting the mercy of Prahlada Maharaja and also that of Nrsimhadeva,
then our Krsna consciousness movement will be extremely successful.
The demon Hiranyakasipu had so many ways to try to become God himself, but although Prahlada
Maharaja was chastised and threatened in many ways, he rigidly refused to accept his powerful demoniac
father as God. Following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, we should reject all the rascals who
pretend to be God. We must accept Krsna and His incarnations, and no one else.

TRANSLATION
This narration describes the characteristics of the great and exalted devotee Prahlada Maharaja, his
staunch devotional service, his perfect knowledge, and his perfect detachment from material
contamination. It also describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the cause of creation,
maintenance and annihilation. Prahlada Maharaja, in his prayers, has described the transcendental
qualities of the Lord and has also described how the various abodes of the demigods and demons,
regardless of how materially opulent, are destroyed by the mere direction of the Lord.
PURPORT
Srimad-Bhagavatam is filled with descriptions of the characteristics of various devotees, with reference
to the service of the Lord. This Vedic literature is called Bhagavatam because it deals with the Supreme
personality of Godhead and His devotee. By studying Srimad-Bhagavatam under the direction of the bona
fide spiritual master, one can perfectly understand the science of Krsna, the nature of the material and
spiritual worlds, and the aim of life. Srimad-Bhagavatam amalam puranam. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the
spotless Vedic literature, as we have discussed in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Therefore, simply
by understanding Srimad-Bhagavatam, one can understand the science of the activities of the devotees, the
activities of the demons, the permanent abode and the temporary abode. Through Srimad-Bhagavatam,
everything is perfectly known.
