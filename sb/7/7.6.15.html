<h2>Text</h2>
vittesu nityabhinivista-ceta
vidvams ca dosam para-vitta-hartuh
pretyeha vathapy ajitendriyas tad
asanta-kamo harate kutumbi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vittesu--in material wealth; nitya-abhinivista-cetah--whose mind is always absorbed; vidvan--having
learned; ca--also; dosam--the fault; para-vitta-hartuh--of one who steals the money of others by cheating
or by transactions on the black market; pretya--after dying; iha--in this material world; va--or; athapi--
still; ajita-indriyah--because of being unable to control the senses; tat--that; asanta-kamah--whose desires
are unsatiated; harate--steals; kutumbi--too fond of his family.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
If a person too attached to the duties of family maintenance is unable to control his senses, the core of
his heart is immersed in how to accumulate money. Although he knows that one who takes the wealth of
others will be punished by the law of the government, and by the laws of Yamaraja after death, he
continues cheating others to acquire money.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Especially in these days, people do not believe in a next life or in the court of Yamaraja and the various
punishments of the sinful. But at least one should know that one who cheats others to acquire money will
be punished by the laws of the government. Nonetheless, people do not care about the laws of this life or
those governing the next. Despite whatever knowledge one has, one cannot stop his sinful activities if he
is unable to control his senses.
