tasmat sarvesu bhutesu
dayam kuruta sauhrdam
bhavam asuram unmucya
yaya tusyaty adhoksajah
SYNONYMS
tasmat--therefore; sarvesu--to all; bhutesu--living entities; dayam--mercy; kuruta--show; sauhrdam--
friendliness; bhavam--the attitude; asuram--of the demons (who separate friends and enemies);
unmucya--giving up; yaya--by which; tusyati--is satisfied; adhoksajah--the Supreme Lord, who is beyond
the perception of the senses.
TRANSLATION
Therefore, my dear young friends born of demons, please act in such a way that the Supreme Lord, who
is beyond the conception of material knowledge, will be satisfied. Give up your demoniac nature and act
without enmity or duality. Show mercy to all living entities by enlightening them in devotional service,
thus becoming their well-wishers.
PURPORT
The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: "One can
understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service." Prahlada Maharaja ultimately
instructed his class friends, the sons of the demons, to accept the process of devotional service by
preaching the science of Krsna consciousness to everyone. Preaching is the best service to the Lord. The
Lord will immediately be extremely satisfied with one who engages in this service of preaching Krsna
consciousness. This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (18.69). Na ca tasman manusyesu
kascin me priya-krttamah: "There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever
be one more dear." If one sincerely tries his best to spread Krsna consciousness by preaching the glories of
the Lord and His supremacy, even if he is imperfectly educated, he becomes the dearmost servant of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is bhakti. As one performs this service for humanity, without
discrimination between friends and enemies, the Lord becomes satisfied, and the mission of one's life is
fulfilled. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore advised everyone to become a guru-devotee and preach
Krsna consciousness (yare dekha, tare kaha 'krsna'-upadesa). That is the easiest way to realize the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. By such preaching, the preacher becomes satisfied, and those to whom
he preaches are also satisfied. This is the process of bringing peace and tranquillity to the entire world.
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
One is expected to understand these three formulas of knowledge concerning the Supreme Lord--that
He is the supreme enjoyer, that He is the proprietor of everything, and that He is the best well-wisher and
friend of everyone. A preacher should personally understand these truths and preach them to everyone.
Then there will be peace and tranquillity all over the world.
The word sauhrdam ("friendliness") is very significant in this verse. People are generally ignorant of
Krsna consciousness, and therefore to become their best well-wisher one should teach them about Krsna
consciousness without discrimination. Since the Supreme Lord, Visnu, is situated in the core of everyone's
heart, every body is a temple of Visnu. One should not misuse this understanding as an excuse for such
words as daridra-narayana. If Narayana lives in the house of a daridra, a poor man, this does not mean
that Narayana becomes poor. He lives everywhere--in the houses of the poor and those of the rich--but in
all circumstances He remains Narayana; to think that He becomes either poor or rich is a material
calculation. He is always sad-aisvarya-purna, full in six opulences, in all circumstances.
