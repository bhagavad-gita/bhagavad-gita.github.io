<h2>Text</h2>
dehendriyasu-hinanam
vaikuntha-pura-vasinam
deha-sambandha-sambaddham
etad akhyatum arhasi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
deha--of a material body; indriya--material senses; asu--life breath; hinanam--of those devoid;
vaikuntha-pura--of Vaikuntha; vasinam--of the residents; deha-sambandha--in a material body;
sambaddham--bondage; etat--this; akhyatum arhasi--please describe.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The bodies of the inhabitants of Vaikuntha are completely spiritual, having nothing to do with the
material body, senses or life air. Therefore, kindly explain how associates of the Personality of Godhead
were cursed to descend in material bodies like ordinary persons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This very significant question would be difficult for an ordinary person to answer, but Narada Muni,
being an authority, could answer it. Therefore Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired from him, saying, etad
akhyatum arhasi: "only you can explain the reason." From authoritative sources it can be discerned that
associates of Lord Visnu who descend from Vaikuntha do not actually fall. They come with the purpose of
fulfilling the desire of the Lord, and their descent to this material world is comparable to that of the Lord.
The Lord comes to this material world through the agency of His internal potency, and similarly, when a
devotee or associate of the Lord descends to this material world, he does so through the action of the
spiritual energy. Any pastime conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is an arrangement by
yogamaya, not mahamaya. Therefore it is to be understood that when Jaya and Vijaya descended to this
material world, they came because there was something to be done for the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Otherwise it is a fact that no one falls from Vaikuntha.
Of course, a living entity who desires sayujya-mukti remains in Krsna's Brahman effulgence, which is
dependent on Krsna's body (brahmano hi pratisthaham). Such an impersonalist who takes shelter of the
Brahman effulgence must surely fall down. This is stated in the sastra (Bhag. 10.2.32):
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
"O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure.
Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are
sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet." The
impersonalists cannot reach the Vaikuntha planets to become associates of the Lord, and therefore,
according to their desires, Krsna gives them sayujya-mukti. However, since sayujya-mukti is partial
mukti, they must fall again to this material world. When it is said that the individual soul falls from
Brahmaloka, this applies to the impersonalist.
From authoritative sources it is learned that Jaya and Vijaya were sent to this material world to fulfill
the Lord's desire to fight. The Lord also sometimes wants to fight, but who can fight with the Lord but a
very confidential devotee of the Lord? Jaya and Vijaya descended to this world to fulfill the Lord's desire.
Therefore in each of their three births--first as Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu, second as Ravana and
Kumbhakarna, and third as Sisupala and Dantavakra--the Lord personally killed them. In other words,
these associates of the Lord, Jaya and Vijaya, descended to the material world to serve the Lord by
fulfilling His desire to fight. Otherwise, as Maharaja Yudhisthira says, asraddheya ivabhati: the statement
that a servant of the Lord could fall from Vaikuntha seems unbelievable. How Jaya and Vijaya came to this
material world is explained by Narada Muni as follows.
