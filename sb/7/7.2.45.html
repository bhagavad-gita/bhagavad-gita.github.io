<h2>Text</h2>
na srota nanuvaktayam
mukhyo 'py atra mahan asuh
yas tv ihendriyavan atma
sa canyah prana-dehayoh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; srota--the listener; na--not; anuvakta--the speaker; ayam--this; mukhyah--chief; api--although;
atra--in this body; mahan--the great; asuh--life air; yah--he who; tu--but; iha--in this body; indriya-van--
possessing all the sense organs; atma--the soul; sah--he; ca--and; anyah--different; prana-dehayoh--from
the life air and the material body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the body the most important substance is the life air, but that also is neither the listener nor the
speaker. Beyond even the life air, the soul also can do nothing, for the Supersoul is actually the director,
in cooperation with the individual soul. The Supersoul conducting the activities of the body is different
from the body and living force.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead distinctly says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come
remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness." Although the atma, or soul, is present in every material
body (dehino 'smin yatha dehe), he is not actually the chief person acting through the senses, mind and
so on. The soul can merely act in cooperation with the Supersoul because it is the Supersoul who gives
him directions to act or not to act (mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca). One cannot act without His
sanction, for the Supersoul is upadrasta and anumanta, the witness and sanctioner. One who studies
carefully, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, can understand the real knowledge that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the conductor of all the activities of the individual soul, and
the controller of their results as well. Although the individual soul possesses the indriyas, or senses, he is
not actually the proprietor, for the proprietor is the Supersoul. Consequently the Supersoul is called
Hrsikesa, and the individual soul is advised by the direction of the Supersoul to surrender to Him and
thus be happy (sama-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). Thus he can become immortal and
be transferred to the spiritual kingdom, where he will achieve the highest success of an eternal, blissful
life of knowledge. In conclusion, the individual soul is different from the body, senses, living force and
the airs within the body, and above him is the Supersoul, who gives the individual soul all facilities. The
individual soul who renders everything to the Supersoul lives very happily within the body.
