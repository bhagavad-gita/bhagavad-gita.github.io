<h2>Text</h2>
tam manyamano nija-virya-sankitam
yad dhasta-mukto nrharim mahasurah
punas tam asajjata khadga-carmani
pragrhya vegena gata-sramo mrdhe
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--Him (Lord Nrsimhadeva); manyamanah--thinking; nija-virya-sankitam--afraid of his prowess; yat--
because; hasta-muktah--freed from the clutches of the Lord; nr-harim--Lord Nrsimhadeva; maha-asurah--
the great demon; punah--again; tam--Him; asajjata--attacked; khadga-carmani--his sword and shield;
pragrhya--taking up; vegena--with great force; gata-sramah--his fatigue having gone; mrdhe--in the battle.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Hiranyakasipu was freed from the hands of Nrsimhadeva, he falsely thought that the Lord was
afraid of his prowess. Therefore, after taking a little rest from the fight, he took up his sword and shield
and again attacked the Lord with great force.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a sinful man enjoys material facilities, foolish people sometimes think, "How is it that this sinful
man is enjoying whereas a pious man is suffering?" By the will of the Supreme, a sinful man is sometimes
given the chance to enjoy the material world as if he were not under the clutches of material nature, just
so that he may be fooled. A sinful man who acts against the laws of nature must be punished, but
sometimes he is given a chance to play, exactly like Hiranyakasipu when he was released from the hands
of Nrsimhadeva. Hiranyakasipu was destined to be ultimately killed by Nrsimhadeva, but just to see the
fun, the Lord gave him a chance to slip from His hands.
