<h2>Synonyms</h2>
grhasthasya--for a person situated in householder life; kriya-tyagah--to give up the duty of a
householder; vrata-tyagah--to give up vows and austerity; vatoh--for a brahmacari; api--also; tapasvinah--
for a vanaprastha, one who has adopted a life of austerities; grama-seva--to live in a village and serve the
people therein; bhiksoh--for a sannyasi who lived by begging alms; indriya-lolata--addicted to sense
enjoyment; asrama--of the spiritual orders of life; apasadah--the most abominable; hi--indeed; ete--all
these; khalu--indeed; asrama-vidambanah--imitating and therefore cheating the different spiritual orders;
deva-maya-vimudhan--who are bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Lord; tan--them;
upekseta--one should reject and not accept as genuine; anukampaya--or by compassion (teach them real
life).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It is abominable for a person living in the grhastha-asrama to give up the regulative principles, for a
brahmacari not to follow the brahmacari vows while living under the care of the guru, for a vanaprastha
to live in the village and engage in so-called social activities, or for a sannyasi to be addicted to sense
gratification. One who acts in this way is to be considered the lowest renegade. Such a pretender is
bewildered by the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should either reject
him from any position, or taking compassion upon him, teach him, if possible, to resume his original
position.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have repeatedly stressed that human culture does not begin unless one takes to the principles of
varnasrama-dharma. Although grhastha life is a concession for the enjoyment of sex, one cannot enjoy sex
without following the rules and regulations of householder life. Furthermore, as already instructed, a
brahmacari must live under the care of the guru: brahmacari guru-kule vasan danto guror hitam. If a
brahmacari does not live under the care of the guru, if a vanaprastha engages in ordinary activities, or if a
sannyasi is greedy and eats meat, eggs and all kinds of nonsense for the satisfaction of his tongue, he is a
cheater and should immediately be rejected as unimportant. Such persons should be shown compassion,
and if one has sufficient strength one should teach them to stop them from following the wrong path in
life. Otherwise one should reject them and pay them no attention.
