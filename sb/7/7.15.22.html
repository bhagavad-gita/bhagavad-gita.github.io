<h2>Translation</h2>
By making plans with determination, one should give up lusty desires for sense gratification. Similarly,
by giving up envy one should conquer anger, by discussing the disadvantages of accumulating wealth one
should give up greed, and by discussing the truth one should give up fear.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has suggested how one can conquer lusty desires for sense
gratification. One cannot give up thinking of women, for thinking in this way is natural; even while
walking on the street, one will see so many women. However, if one is determined not to live with a
woman, even while seeing a woman he will not become lusty. If one is determined not to have sex, he can
automatically conquer lusty desires. The example given in this regard is that even if one is hungry, if on a
particular day he is determined to observe fasting, he can naturally conquer the disturbances of hunger
and thirst. If one is determined not to be envious of anyone, he can naturally conquer anger. Similarly,
one can give up the desire to accumulate wealth simply by considering how difficult it is to protect the
money in one's possession. If one keeps a large amount of cash with him, he is always anxious about
keeping it properly. Thus if one discusses the disadvantages of accumulating wealth, he can naturally give
up business without difficulty.
