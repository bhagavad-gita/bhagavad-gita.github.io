<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any
country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually
addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the
hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are
very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of
demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of Narayana is liberation from
the bondage of material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja has maintained the philosophical point of view that one should give up the dark well
of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
(hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta). In this verse also, he stresses the
same point. In the history of human society, no one, at any time or any place, has been liberated because
of too much affection and attachment for his family. Even in those who are apparently very educated, the
same family attachment is there. They cannot give up the association of their families, even in old age or
invalidity, for they are attached to sense enjoyment. As we have several times discussed, yan maithunadigrhamedhi-
sukham hi tuccham: so-called householders are simply attracted by sexual enjoyment. Thus
they keep themselves shackled in family life, and furthermore they want their children to be shackled in
the same way. Playing the parts of playboys in the hands of women, they glide down to the darkest
regions of material existence. Adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram punah punas carvita-carvananam. Because
they are unable to control their senses, they continue a life of chewing the chewed and therefore descend
to the darkest material regions. One should give up the association of such demons and adhere to the
association of devotees. Thus one will be able to be liberated from material bondage.
