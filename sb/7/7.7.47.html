<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
karmany arabhate dehi
dehenatmanuvartina
karmabhis tanute deham
ubhayam tv avivekatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
karmani--material fruitive activities; arabhate--begins; dehi--a living entity who has accepted a particular
type of body; dehena--with that body; atma-anuvartina--which is received according to his desire and past
activities; karmabhih--by such material activities; tanute--he expands; deham--another body; ubhayam--
both of them; tu--indeed; avivekatah--due to ignorance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity, who has received his present body because of his past fruitive activity, may end the
results of his actions in this life, but this does not mean that he is liberated from bondage to material
bodies. The living entity receives one type of body, and by performing actions with that body he creates
another. Thus he transmigrates from one body to another, through repeated birth and death, because of
his gross ignorance.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entity's evolution through different types of bodies is conducted automatically by the laws of
nature in bodies other than those of human beings. In other words, by the laws of nature (prakrteh
kriyamanani) the living entity evolves from lower grades of life to the human form. Because of his
developed consciousness, however, the human being must understand the constitutional position of the
living entity and understand why he must accept a material body. This chance is given to him by nature,
but if he nonetheless acts like an animal, what is the benefit of his human life? In this life one must select
the goal of life and act accordingly. Having received instructions from the spiritual master and the sastra,
one must be sufficiently intelligent. In the human form of life, one should not remain foolish and
ignorant, but must inquire about his constitutional position. This is called athato brahma-jijnasa. The
human psychology gives rise to many questions, which various philosophers have considered and
answered with various types of philosophy based upon mental concoction. This is not the way of
liberation. The Vedic instructions say, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: to solve the problems of
life, one must accept a spiritual master. Tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam: if one is
actually serious in inquiring about the solution to material existence, one must approach a bona fide guru.
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render
service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."
(Bg. 4.34) One must approach a bona fide spiritual master by surrendering himself (pranipatena) and
rendering service. An intelligent person must inquire from the spiritual master about the goal of life. A
bona fide spiritual master can answer all such questions because he has seen the real truth. Even in
ordinary activities, we first consider gain and loss, and then we act. Similarly, an intelligent person must
consider the entire process of material existence and then act intelligently, following the directions of the
bona fide spiritual master.
