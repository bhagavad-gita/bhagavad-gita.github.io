<h2>Translation</h2>
The inhabitants of Kimpurusa-loka said: We are insignificant living entities, and You are the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller. Therefore how can we offer suitable prayers unto You?
When this demon was condemned by devotees because they were disgusted with him, he was then killed
by You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The cause of the Supreme Lord's appearance upon this earth is stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.7-8) by the
Lord Himself:
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
paritranaya sadhunam
vinasaya ca duskrtam
dharma-samsthapanarthaya
sambhavami yuge yuge
"Whenever and wherever there is a decrease in religious principles and a predominant rise in irreligion,
at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish
the principles of religion, I advent Myself, millennium after millennium." The Lord appears in order to
execute two kinds of activities--to kill the demons and to protect the devotees. When the devotees are too
disturbed by the demons, the Lord certainly appears in different incarnations to give the devotees
protection. The devotees following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja should not be disturbed by the
demoniac activities of the nondevotees. Rather, they should stick to their principles as sincere servants of
the Lord and rest assured that the demoniac activities directed against them will not be able to stop their
devotional service.
