sri-narada uvaca
evam pralobhyamano 'pi
varair loka-pralobhanaih
ekantitvad bhagavati
naicchat tan asurottamah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--the great saint Narada said; evam--thus; pralobhyamanah--being allured or induced;
api--although; varaih--by benedictions; loka--of the world; pralobhanaih--by different kinds of
allurements; ekantitvat--because of being solely surrendered; bhagavati--unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; na aicchat--did not want; tan--those benedictions; asura-uttamah--Prahlada Maharaja, the best
of the family of asuras.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni said: Prahlada Maharaja was the best person in the family of asuras, who always aspire for
material happiness. Nonetheless, although allured by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who offered
him all benedictions for material happiness, because of his unalloyed Krsna consciousness he did not
want to take any material benefit for sense gratification.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Pure devotees like Prahlada Maharaja and Dhruva Maharaja do not aspire for any material benefit at any
stage of devotional service. When the Lord was present before Dhruva Maharaja, Dhruva did not want to
take any material benefit from the Lord: svamin krtartho 'smi varam na yace. As a pure devotee, he could
not ask the Lord for any material benefit. In this regard, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed us:
na dhanam na janam na sundarim
kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye
mama janmani janmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi
"O my Lord, Jagadisa, I do not pray for benedictions by which to achieve material wealth, popularity or
beauty. My only desire is to serve You. Kindly engage me in the service of the servant of Your servant."
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Prahlada Pacifies Lord Nrsimhadeva with Prayers."
Chapter Ten
Prahlada, the Best Among Exalted Devotees
This chapter describes how the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nrsimhadeva disappeared, after
pleasing Prahlada Maharaja. It also describes a benediction given by Lord Siva.
Lord Nrsimhadeva wanted to bestow benedictions upon Prahlada Maharaja, one after another, but
Prahlada Maharaja, thinking them impediments on the path of spiritual progress, did not accept any of
them. Instead, he fully surrendered at the Lord's lotus feet. He said: "If anyone engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord prays for personal sense gratification, he cannot be called a pure devotee or even a
devotee. He may be called only a merchant engaged in the business of give and take. Similarly, a master
who wants to please his servant after taking service from him is also not a real master." Prahlada
Maharaja, therefore, did not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, he said that
if the Lord wanted to give him a benediction, he wanted the Lord to assure him that he would never be
induced to take any benedictions for the sake of material desires. Exchanges of devotional service for lusty
desires are always very prominent. As soon as lusty desires awaken, one's senses, mind, life, soul, religious
principles, patience, intelligence, shyness, beauty, strength, memory and truthfulness are all vanquished.
One can render unalloyed devotional service only when there are no material desires in one's mind.
The Supreme personality of Godhead was greatly pleased with Prahlada Maharaja for his unalloyed
devotion, yet the Lord provided him one material benediction--that he would be perfectly happy in this
world and live his next life in Vaikuntha. The Lord gave him the benediction that he would be the king of
this material world until the end of the manvantara millennium and that although in this material world,
he would have the facility to hear the glories of the Lord and depend fully on the Lord, performing service
to Him in uncontaminated bhakti-yoga. The Lord advised Prahlada to perform sacrifices through bhaktiyoga,
for this is the duty of a king.
Prahlada Maharaja accepted whatever the Lord had offered him, and he prayed for the Lord to deliver
his father. In response to this prayer, the Lord assured him that in the family of such a pure devotee as he,
not only the devotee's father but his forefathers for twenty-one generations are liberated. The Lord also
asked Prahlada to perform the ritualistic ceremonies appropriate after his father's death.
Then Lord Brahma, who was also present, offered many prayers to the Lord, expressing his obligation to
the Lord for having offered benedictions to Prahlada Maharaja. The Lord advised Lord Brahma not to offer
benedictions to asuras as he had to Hiranyakasipu, for such benedictions indulge them. Then Lord
Nrsimhadeva disappeared. On that day, Prahlada Maharaja was installed on the throne of the world by
Lord Brahma and Sukracarya.
Thus Narada Muni described the character of Prahlada Maharaja for Yudhisthira Maharaja, and he
further described the killing of Ravana by Lord Ramacandra and the killing of Sisupala and Dantavakra in
Dvapara-yuga. Sisupala, of course, had merged into the existence of the Lord and thus achieved sayujyamukti.
Narada Muni praised Yudhisthira Maharaja because the Supreme Lord, Krsna, was the greatest
well-wisher and friend of the Pandavas and almost always stayed in their house. Thus the fortune of the
Pandavas was greater than that of Prahlada Maharaja.
Later, Narada Muni described how the demon Maya Danava constructed Tripura for the demons, who
became very powerful and defeated the demigods. Because of this defeat, Lord Rudra, Siva, dismantled
Tripura; thus he became famous as Tripurari. For this, Rudra is very much appreciated and worshiped by
the demigods. This narration occurs at the end of the chapter.
