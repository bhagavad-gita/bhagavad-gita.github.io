<h2>Translation</h2>
An expert geologist can understand where there is gold and by various processes can extract it from the
gold ore. Similarly, a spiritually advanced person can understand how the spiritual particle exists within
the body, and thus by cultivating spiritual knowledge he can attain perfection in spiritual life. However, as
one who is not expert cannot understand where there is gold, a foolish person who has not cultivated
spiritual knowledge cannot understand how the spirit exists within the body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is a very good example concerning spiritual understanding. Foolish rascals, including so-called
jnanis, philosophers and scientists, cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body because
they are lacking in spiritual knowledge. The Vedas enjoin, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: to
understand spiritual knowledge, one must approach a bona fide spiritual master. Unless one has been
trained in geology, one cannot detect gold in stone. Similarly, unless one has been trained by a spiritual
master, he cannot understand what is spirit and what is matter. Here it is said, yogais tad-abhijnah. This
indicates that one who has connected himself with spiritual knowledge can understand that there is a
spiritual soul within the body. However, one who is in an animalistic conception of life and has no
spiritual culture cannot understand. As an expert mineralogist or geologist can understand where there is
gold and can then invest his money to dig there and chemically separate the gold from the ore, an expert
spiritualist can understand where the soul is within matter. One who has not been trained cannot
distinguish between gold and stone. Similarly, fools and rascals who have not learned from an expert
spiritual master what is soul and what is matter cannot understand the existence of the soul within the
body. To understand such knowledge, one must be trained in the mystic yoga system, or, finally, in the
bhakti-yoga system. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati. Unless one takes shelter
of the bhakti-yoga process, one cannot understand the existence of the soul within the body. Therefore
Bhagavad-gita begins by teaching:
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
(Bg. 2.13) Thus the first instruction is that one should understand that the soul is within the body and is
transmigrating from one body to another. This is the beginning of spiritual knowledge. Any person who is
not expert in understanding this science or is unwilling to understand it remains in the bodily conception
of life, or the animalistic conception of life, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (yasyatma-buddhih
kunape tri-dhatuke. .. sa eva go-kharah). Every member of human society should clearly understand the
instructions of Bhagavad-gita, for only in this way can one be spiritually elevated and automatically give
up the false, illusory knowledge by which one thinks, "I am this body, and everything belonging to this
body is mine [aham mameti]." This doggish conception should be rejected immediately. One should be
prepared to understand the spirit soul and the supreme spirit, God, who are eternally related. Thus one
may return home, back to Godhead, having solved all the problems of life.
