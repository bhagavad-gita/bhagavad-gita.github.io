<h2>Text</h2>
sri-narada uvaca
srutva putra-giro daityah
para-paksa-samahitah
jahasa buddhir balanam
bhidyate para-buddhibhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--Narada Muni said; srutva--hearing; putra-girah--the instructive words of his son;
daityah--Hiranyakasipu; para-paksa--on the side of the enemy; samahitah--full of faith; jahasa--laughed;
buddhih--the intelligence; balanam--of small boys; bhidyate--is polluted; para-buddhibhih--by
instructions from the enemy's camp.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni continued: When Prahlada Maharaja spoke about the path of self-realization in devotional
service, thus being faithful to the camp of his father's enemies, Hiranyakasipu, the King of the demons,
heard Prahlada's words and he laughingly said, "Thus is the intelligence of children spoiled by the words
of the enemy."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu, being a demon, would always consider Lord Visnu and His devotees to be his enemies.
Therefore the word para-paksa ("on the side of the enemy") is used here. Hiranyakasipu never agreed
with the words of Visnu, or Krsna. Rather, he was angered by the intelligence of a Vaisnava. Lord Visnu,
Lord Krsna, says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja--"Give up all other duties and
surrender unto Me"--but demons like Hiranyakasipu never agree to do this. Therefore Krsna says:
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayaparhrta-jnana
asuram bhavam asritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." (Bg. 7.15) The
asura-bhava, the atheistic nature, is directly represented by Hiranyakasipu. Such persons, being mudha
and naradhama--fools and rascals, the lowest of men--would never accept Visnu as the Supreme and
surrender to Him. Hiranyakasipu naturally became increasingly angry that his son Prahlada was being
influenced by the camp of the enemies. He therefore asked that saintly persons like Narada not be allowed
within the residential quarters of his son, for otherwise Prahlada would be further spoiled by Vaisnava
instructions.
