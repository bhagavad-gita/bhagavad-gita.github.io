<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/7/7.1.8.html">7.1.8</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
jaya-kale tu sattvasya
devarsin rajaso 'suran
tamaso yaksa-raksamsi
tat-kalanuguno 'bhajat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jaya-kale--in the time of prominence; tu--indeed; sattvasya--of goodness; deva--the demigods; rsin--and
the sages; rajasah--of passion; asuran--the demons; tamasah--of ignorance; yaksa-raksamsi--the Yaksas and
Raksasas; tat-kala-anugunah--according to the particular time; abhajat--fostered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the quality of goodness is prominent, the sages and demigods flourish with the help of that
quality, with which they are infused and surcharged by the Supreme Lord. Similarly, when the mode of
passion is prominent the demons flourish, and when ignorance is prominent the Yaksas and Raksasas
flourish. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is present in everyone's heart, fostering the reactions of
sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not partial to anyone. The conditioned soul is under the
influence of the various modes of material nature, and behind material nature is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead; but one's victory and loss under the influence of sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna are
reactions of these modes, not of the Supreme Lord's partiality. Srila Jiva Gosvami, in the Bhagavatasandarbha,
has clearly said:
sattvadayo na santise
yatra ca prakrta gunah
sa suddhah sarva-suddhebhyah
puman adhyah prasidatu
hladini sandhini samvit
tvayy eka sarva-samsthitau
hlada-tapa-kari misra
tvayi no guna-varjite
According to this statement of the Bhagavata-sandarbha, the Supreme Lord, being always transcendental
to the material qualities, is never affected by the influence of these qualities. This same characteristic is
also present in the living being, but because he is conditioned by material nature, even the pleasure
potency of the Lord is manifested in the conditioned soul as troublesome. In the material world the
pleasure enjoyed by the conditioned soul is followed by many painful conditions. For instance, we have
seen that in the two great wars, which were conducted by the rajo-guna and tamo-guna, both parties were
actually ruined. The German people declared war against the English to ruin them, but the result was that
both parties were ruined. Although the Allies were apparently victorious, at least on paper, actually
neither of them were victorious. Therefore it should be concluded that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is not partial to anyone. Everyone works under the influence of various modes of material
nature, and when the various modes are prominent, the demigods or demons appear victorious under the
influence of these modes.
Everyone enjoys the fruits of his qualitative activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.11-
13):
sarva-dvaresu dehe 'smin
prakasa upajayate
jnanam yada tada vidyad
vivrddham sattvam ity uta
lobhah pravrttir arambhah
karmanam asamah sprha
rajasy etani jayante
vivrddhe bharatarsabha
aprakaso 'pravrttis ca
pramado moha eva ca
tamasy etani jayante
vivrddhe kuru-nandana
"The manifestations of the modes of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are
illumined by knowledge.
"O chief of the Bharatas, when there is an increase in the mode of passion, the symptoms of great
attachment, uncontrollable desire, hankering, and intense endeavor develop.
"O son of Kuru, when there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, madness, illusion, inertia and
darkness are manifested."
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone's heart, simply gives the results of the
increase in the various qualities, but He is impartial. He supervises victory and loss, but He does not take
part in them.
The various modes of material nature do not work all at once. The interactions of these modes are
exactly like seasonal changes. Sometimes there is an increment of rajo-guna, sometimes of tamo-guna and
sometimes sattva-guna. Generally the demigods are surcharged with sattva-guna, and therefore when the
demons and the demigods fight, the demigods are victorious because of the prominence of their sattvaguna
qualities. However, this is not the partiality of the Supreme Lord.
