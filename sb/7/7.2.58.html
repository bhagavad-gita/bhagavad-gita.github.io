bala evam pravadati
sarve vismita-cetasah
jnatayo menire sarvam
anityam ayathotthitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-hiranyakasipuh uvaca--Sri Hiranyakasipu said; bale--while Yamaraja in the form of a boy; evam--
thus; pravadati--was speaking very philosophically; sarve--all; vismita--struck with wonder; cetasah--their
hearts; jnatayah--the relatives; menire--they thought; sarvam--everything material; anityam--temporary;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Hiranyakasipu said: While Yamaraja, in the form of a small boy, was instructing all the relatives
surrounding the dead body of Suyajna, everyone was struck with wonder by his philosophical words.
They could understand that everything material is temporary, not continuing to exist.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.18). Antavanta ime deha nityasyoktah saririnah: the body is
perishable, but the soul within the body is imperishable. Therefore the duty of those advanced in
knowledge in human society is to study the constitutional position of the imperishable soul and not waste
the valuable time of human life in merely maintaining the body and not considering life's real
responsibility. Every human being should try to understand how the spirit soul can be happy and where
he can attain an eternal, blissful life of knowledge. Human beings are meant to study these subject
matters, not to be absorbed in caring for the temporary body, which is sure to change. No one knows
whether he will receive a human body again; there is no guarantee, for according to one's work one may
get any body, from that of a demigod to that of a dog. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya comments:
aham mamabhimanaditva-
yathottham anityakam
mahadadi yathottham ca
nitya capi yathotthita
asvatantraiva prakrtih
sva-tantro nitya eva ca
yathartha-bhutas ca para
eka eva janardanah
Only Janardana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ever existing, but His creation, the material
world, is temporary. Therefore everyone who is captivated by the material energy and absorbed in
thinking "I am this body, and everything belonging to this body is mine" is in illusion. One should think
only of being eternally a part of Janardana, and one's endeavor in this material world, especially in this
human form of life, should be to attain the association of Janardana by going back home, back to
Godhead.
