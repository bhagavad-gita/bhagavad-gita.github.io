<h2>Text</h2>
nasac-chastresu sajjeta
nopajiveta jivikam
vada-vadams tyajet tarkan
paksam kamca na samsrayet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; asat-sastresu--literature like newspapers, novels, dramas and fiction; sajjeta--one should be
attached or should indulge in reading; na--nor; upajiveta--one should try to live; jivikam--upon some
professional literary career; vada-vadan--unnecessary arguments on different aspects of philosophy;
tyajet--one should give up; tarkan--arguments and counterarguments; paksam--faction; kamca--any; na--
not; samsrayet--should take shelter of.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Literature that is a useless waste of time--in other words, literature without spiritual benefit--should be
rejected. One should not become a professional teacher as a means of earning one's livelihood, nor should
one indulge in arguments and counter-arguments. Nor should one take shelter of any cause or faction.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A person desiring to advance in spiritual understanding should be extremely careful to avoid reading
ordinary literature. The world is full of ordinary literature that creates unnecessary agitation in the mind.
Such literature, including newspapers, dramas, novels and magazines, is factually not meant for
advancement in spiritual knowledge. Indeed, it has been described as a place of enjoyment for crows (tad
vayasam tirtham). Anyone advancing in spiritual knowledge must reject such literature. Furthermore, one
should not concern oneself with the conclusions of various logicians or philosophers. Of course, those
who preach sometimes need to argue with the contentions of opponents, but as much as possible one
should avoid an argumentative attitude. In this connection, Srila Madhvacarya says:
aprayojana-paksam na samsrayet
naprayojana-paksi syan
na vrtha sisya-bandha-krt
na codasinah sastrani
na viruddhani cabhyaset
na vyakhyayopajiveta
na nisiddhan samacaret
evam-bhuto yatir yati
tad-eka-sarano harim
"There is no need to take shelter of unnecessary literature or concern oneself with many so-called
philosophers and thinkers who are useless for spiritual advancement. Nor should one accept a disciple for
the sake of fashion or popularity. One should be callous to these so-called sastras, neither opposing nor
favoring them, and one should not earn one's livelihood by taking money for explaining sastra. A sannyasi
must always be neutral and seek the means to advance in spiritual life, taking full shelter under the lotus
feet of the Lord."
