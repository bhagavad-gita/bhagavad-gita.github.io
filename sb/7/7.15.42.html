<h2>Text</h2>
aksam dasa-pranam adharma-dharmau
cakre 'bhimanam rathinam ca jivam
dhanur hi tasya pranavam pathanti
saram tu jivam param eva laksyam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aksam--the spokes (on the chariot wheel); dasa--ten; pranam--the ten kinds of air flowing within the
body; adharma--irreligion; dharmau--religion (two sides of the wheel, up and down); cakre--in the wheel;
abhimanam--false identification; rathinam--the charioteer or master of the body; ca--also; jivam--the living
entity; dhanuh--the bow; hi--indeed; tasya--his; pranavam--the Vedic mantra omkara; pathanti--it is said;
saram--an arrow; tu--but; jivam--the living entity; param--the Supreme Lord; eva--indeed; laksyam--the
target.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The ten kinds of air acting within the body are compared to the spokes of the chariot's wheels, and the
top and bottom of the wheel itself are called religion and irreligion. The living entity in the bodily concept
of life is the owner of the chariot. The Vedic mantra pranava is the bow, the pure living entity himself is
the arrow, and the target is the Supreme Being.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Ten kinds of life air always flow within the material body. They are called prana, apana, samana, vyana,
udana, naga, kurma, krkala, devadatta and dhananjaya. They are compared here to the spokes of the
chariot's wheels. The life air is the energy for all of a living being's activities, which are sometimes
religious and sometimes irreligious. Thus religion and irreligion are said to be the upper and lower
portions of the chariot's wheels. When the living entity decides to go back home, back to Godhead, his
target is Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the conditioned state of life, one does not
understand that the goal of life is the Supreme Lord. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum durasaya ye
bahir-artha-maninah. The living entity tries to be happy within this material world, not understanding the
target of his life. When he is purified, however, he gives up his bodily conception of life and his false
identity as belonging to a certain community, a certain nation, a certain society, a certain family and so on
(sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam). Then he takes the arrow of his purified life, and with
the help of the bow--the transcendental chanting of pranava, or the Hare Krsna mantra--he throws himself
toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has commented that because the words "bow" and "arrow" are
used in this verse, one might argue that the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity have
become enemies. However, although the Supreme Personality of Godhead may become the so-called
enemy of the living being, this is His chivalrous pleasure. For example, the Lord fought with Bhisma, and
when Bhisma pierced the Lord's body on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, this was a kind of humor or
relationship, of which there are twelve. When the conditioned soul tries to reach the Lord by hurling an
arrow at Him, the Lord takes pleasure, and the living entity gains the profit of going back home, back to
Godhead. Another example given in this regard is that Arjuna, as a result of piercing the adhara-mina, or
the fish within the cakra, achieved the valuable gain of Draupadi. Similarly, if with the arrow of chanting
the holy name of the Lord one pierces Lord Visnu's lotus feet, by dint of performing this heroic activity of
devotional service one receives the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the conditioned stage, one's conceptions of life are sometimes polluted by passion and ignorance,
which are exhibited by attachment, hostility, greed, lamentation, illusion, fear, madness, false prestige,
insults, fault-finding, deception, envy, intolerance, passion, bewilderment, hunger and sleep. All of these
are enemies. Sometimes one's conceptions are also polluted by goodness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The actual aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, but there are many hindrances created by
the three modes of material nature--sometimes by a combination of rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the modes
of passion and ignorance, and sometimes by the mode of goodness. In the material world, even if one is a
philanthropist, a nationalist and a good man according to materialistic estimations, these conceptions of
life form a hindrance to spiritual advancement. How much more of a hindrance, then, are hostility, greed,
illusion, lamentation and too much attachment to material enjoyment? To progress toward the target of
Visnu, which is our real self-interest, one must become very powerful in conquering these various
hindrances or enemies. In other words, one should not be attached to being a good man or a bad man in
this material world.
In this material world, so-called goodness and badness are the same because they consist of the three
modes of material nature. One must transcend this material nature. Even the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies
consist of the three modes of material nature. Therefore Krsna advised Arjuna:
traigunya-visaya veda
nistraigunyo bhavarjuna
nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho
niryoga-ksema atmavan
"The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes,
O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and
safety, and be established in the self." (Bg. 2.45) Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, urdhvam
gacchanti sattva-sthah: if one becomes a very good person--in other words, if one is in the mode of
goodness--he may be elevated to the higher planetary systems. Similarly, if one is infected by rajo-guna
and tamo-guna, he may remain in this world or go down to the animal kingdom. But all of these
situations are hindrances on the path of spiritual salvation. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says:
brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva
guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija
If one is fortunate enough to transcend all this so-called goodness and badness and come to the platform
of devotional service by the mercy of Krsna and the guru, his life becomes successful. In this regard, one
must be very bold so that he can conquer these enemies of Krsna consciousness. Not caring for the good
and bad of this material world, one must boldly propagate Krsna consciousness.
