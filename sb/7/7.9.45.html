<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sex life is compared to the rubbing of two hands to relieve an itch. Grhamedhis, so-called grhasthas who
have no spiritual knowledge, think that this itching is the greatest platform of happiness, although
actually it is a source of distress. The krpanas, the fools who are just the opposite of brahmanas, are not
satisfied by repeated sensuous enjoyment. Those who are dhira, however, who are sober and who tolerate
this itching, are not subjected to the sufferings of fools and rascals.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialists think that sexual indulgence is the greatest happiness in this material world, and therefore
they make elaborate plans to satisfy their senses, especially the genitals. This is generally found
everywhere, and specifically found in the Western world, where there are regular arrangements to satisfy
sex life in different ways. Actually, however, this has not made anyone happy. Even the hippies, who have
given up all the materialistic comforts of their fathers and grandfathers, cannot give up the sensational
happiness of sex life. Such persons are described here as krpanas, misers. The human form of life is a great
asset, for in this life one can fulfill the goal of existence. Unfortunately, however, because of a lack of
education and culture, people are victimized by the false happiness of sex life. Prahlada Maharaja
therefore advises one not to be misled by this civilization of sense gratification, and especially not by sex
life. Rather, one should be sober, avoid sense gratification and be Krsna conscious. The lusty person, who
is compared to a foolish miser, never gets happiness by sense gratification. The influence of material
nature is very difficult to surpass, but as stated by Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (7.14), mam eva ye
prapadyante, mayam etam taranti te: if one voluntarily submits to the lotus feet of Krsna, he can be saved
very easily.
In reference to the low-grade happiness of sex life, Yamunacarya says in this connection:
yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde
nava-nava-rasa-dhamanudyata rantum asit
tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane
bhavati mukha-vikarah sustu nisthivanam ca
"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in
Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste." Yamunacarya
had formerly been a great king who enjoyed sexual happiness in various ways, but since he later engaged
himself in the service of the Lord, he enjoyed spiritual bliss and hated to think of sex life. If sexual
thoughts came to him, he would spit with disgust.
