<h2>Text</h2>
aham tv akamas tvad-bhaktas
tvam ca svamy anapasrayah
nanyathehavayor artho
raja-sevakayor iva
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aham--as far as I am concerned; tu--indeed; akamah--without material desire; tvat-bhaktah--fully
attached to You without motivation; tvam ca--Your Lordship also; svami--the real master; anapasrayah--
without motivation (You do not become the master with motivation); na--not; anyatha--without being in
such a relationship as master and servant; iha--here; avayoh--our; arthah--any motivation (the Lord is the
pure master, and Prahlada Maharaja is the pure devotee with no materialistic motivation); raja--of a king;
sevakayoh--and the servitor; iva--like (just as a king exacts taxes for the benefit of the servant or the
citizens pay taxes for the benefit of the king).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, I am Your unmotivated servant, and You are my eternal master. There is no need of our
being anything other than master and servant. You are naturally my master, and I am naturally Your
servant. We have no other relationship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': every living being is eternally a
servant of the Supreme Lord, Krsna. Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram: "I am the proprietor of all planets, and I am the supreme enjoyer." This is the
natural position of the Lord, and the natural position of the living being is to surrender unto Him (sarvadharman
parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). If this relationship continues, then real happiness exists
eternally between the master and servant. Unfortunately, when this eternal relationship is disturbed, the
living entity wants to become separately happy and thinks that the master is his order supplier. In this
way there cannot be happiness. Nor should the master cater to the desires of the servant. If he does, he is
not the real master. The real master commands, "You must do this," and the real servant immediately
obeys the order. Unless this relationship between the Supreme Lord and the subordinate living entity is
established, there can be no real happiness. The living entity is asraya, always subordinate, and the
Supreme personality of Godhead is visaya, the supreme objective, the goal of life. Unfortunate persons
trapped in this material world do not know this. Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: illusioned by the
material energy, everyone in this material world is unaware that the only aim of life is to approach Lord
Visnu.
aradhananam sarvesam
visnor aradhanam param
tasmat parataram devi
tadiyanam samarcanam
In the Padma Purana Lord Siva explains to his wife, Parvati, the goddess Durga, that the highest goal of
life is to satisfy Lord Visnu, who can be satisfied only when His servant is satisfied. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu therefore teaches, gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah. One must become a
servant of the servant. Prahlada Maharaja also prayed to Lord Nrsimhadeva that he might be engaged as
the servant of the Lord's servant. This is the prescribed method of devotional service. As soon as a devotee
wants the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his order supplier, the Lord immediately refuses to
become the master of such a motivated devotee. In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says, ye yatha mam
prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. "As one surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly."
Materialistic persons are generally inclined to material profits. As long as one continues in such an
adulterated position, he does not receive the benefit of returning home, back to Godhead.
