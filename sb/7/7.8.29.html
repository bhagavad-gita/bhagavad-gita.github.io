tatropaya-sahasranam
ayam bhagavatoditah
yad isvare bhagavati
yatha yair anjasa ratih
SYNONYMS
tatra--in that connection (getting out of the entanglement of material conditioning); upaya--of
processes; sahasranam--of many thousands; ayam--this; bhagavata uditah--given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; yat--which; isvare--to the Lord; bhagavati--the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
yatha--as much as; yaih--by which; anjasa--quickly; ratih--attachment with love and affection.
TRANSLATION
Of the different processes recommended for disentanglement from material life, the one personally
explained and accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be considered all-perfect. That
process is the performance of duties by which love for the Supreme Lord develops.
PURPORT
Among the linking processes that elevate one from bondage to material contamination, the one
recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be accepted as the best. That process is
clearly explained in Bhagavad-gita, where the Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam
vraja: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This process is the best because the
Lord assures, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah: "I shall deliver you from all sinful
reaction. Do not fear." There is no need to be worried, for the Lord Himself assures that He will care for
His devotee and save him from the reactions of sinful activities. Material bondage is a result of sinful
activity. Therefore, since the Lord assures that He will dissipate the results of fruitive material activities,
there is no need to be worried. This process of understanding one's position as a spirit soul and then
engaging oneself in devotional service is therefore the best. The entire Vedic program is based on this
principle, and one can understand it as recommended in the Vedas:
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports
of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23) One must accept the pure
devotee, the representative of God, as one's guru and then offer him all the respects one would offer the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the secret of success. For one who adopts this method, the
perfect process is revealed. In this verse, the words yair anjasa ratih indicate that by offering service and
surrendering to the spiritual master, one is elevated to devotional service, and by performing devotional
service one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this
attachment to the Lord, one can understand the Lord. In other words, one can understand what the Lord's
position is, what our position is and what our relationship is. All this can be understood very easily by the
simple method of bhakti-yoga. As soon as one is situated on the platform of bhakti-yoga, the root cause of
one's suffering and material bondage is destroyed. This is clearly explained in the next verse, which gives
the secret of success.

TRANSLATION
One must accept the bona fide spiritual master and render service unto him with great devotion and
faith. Whatever one has in one's possession should be offered to the spiritual master, and in the
association of saintly persons and devotees one should worship the Lord, hear the glories of the Lord with
faith, glorify the transcendental qualities and activities of the Lord, always meditate on the Lord's lotus
feet, and worship the Deity of the Lord strictly according to the injunctions of the sastra and guru.
PURPORT
In the previous verse it has been said that the process which immediately increases one's love and
affection for the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the best of the many thousands of ways to become
free from the entanglement of material existence. It is also said, dharmasya tattvam nihitam guhayam:
actually the truth of religious principles is extremely confidential. Nonetheless, it can be understood very
easily if one actually adopts the principles of religion. As it is said, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam:
the process of religion is enunciated by the Supreme Lord because He is the supreme authority. This is
also indicated in the previous verse by the word bhagavatoditah. The injunctions or directions of the Lord
are infallible, and their benefits are fully assured. According to His directions, which are explained in this
verse, the perfect form of religion is bhakti-yoga.
To practice bhakti-yoga, one must first accept a bona fide spiritual master. Srila Rupa Gosvami, in his
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.74-75), advises:
guru-padasrayas tasmat
krsna-diksadi-siksanam
visrambhena guroh seva
sadhu-vartmanuvartanam
sad-dharma-prccha bhogadityagah
krsnasya hetave
One's first duty is to accept a bona fide spiritual master. The student or disciple should be very
inquisitive; he should be eager to know the complete truth about eternal religion (sanatana-dharma). The
words guru-susrusaya mean that one should personally serve the spiritual master by giving him bodily
comforts, helping him in bathing, dressing, sleeping, eating and so on. This is called guru-susrusanam. A
disciple should serve the spiritual master as a menial servant, and whatever he has in his possession
should be dedicated to the spiritual master. pranair arthair dhiya vaca. Everyone has his life, his wealth,
his intelligence and his words, and all of them should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead
through the via medium of the spiritual master. Everything should be offered to the spiritual master as a
matter of duty, but the offering should be made to the spiritual master with heart and soul, not artificially
to gain material prestige. This offering is called arpana. Moreover, one should live among devotees, saintly
persons, to learn the etiquette and proper behavior of devotional service. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura remarks in this connection that whatever is offered to the spiritual master should be offered with
love and affection, not for material adoration. Similarly, it is recommended that one associate with
devotees, but there must be some discrimination. Actually, a sadhu, a saintly person, must be saintly in
his behavior (sadhavah sad-acarah). Unless one adheres to the standard behavior, one's position as a
sadhu, a saintly person, is not complete. Therefore a Vaisnava, a sadhu, must completely adhere to the
standard of behavior. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that a Vaisnava, a person initiated into the
Vaisnava cult, should be offered the respect befitting a Vaisnava, which means that he should be offered
service and prayers. However, one should not associate with him if he is not a fit person with whom to
associate.
