<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, original spiritual master of the entire world, what is the
difficulty for You, who manage the affairs of the universe, in delivering the fallen souls engaged in Your
devotional service? You are the friend of all suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary
to show mercy to the foolish. Therefore I think that You will show Your causeless mercy to persons like
us, who engage in Your service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the words priya janan anusevatam nah indicate that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is very favorable to devotees who act according to the instructions of His own pure devotee. In
other words, one must become the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord. If one wants to
become the servant of the Lord directly, this is not as fruitful as engaging in the service of the Lord's
servant. This is the direction of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who shows us the way to become gopi-bhartuh
pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah. One should not be proud of becoming directly the servant of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rather, one must seek a pure devotee, a servant of the Lord, and engage
oneself in the service of such a servant. The more one becomes the servant of the servant, the more one
becomes perfect in devotional service. This is also the injunction of Bhagavad-gita: evam paramparapraptam
imam rajarsayo viduh. One can understand the science of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
simply by the parampara system. In this regard, Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, tandera carana sevi
bhakta-sane vasa: "Let me serve the lotus feet of the devotees of the Lord, and let me live with devotees."
Janame janame haya, ei abhilasa. Following Narottama dasa Thakura, one should aspire to be a servant of
the Lord's servant, life after life. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura also sings, tumi ta' thakura, tomara kukura,
baliya janaha more: "O my Lord, O Vaisnava, please consider me your dog." One must become the dog of
a Vaisnava, a pure devotee, for a pure devotee can deliver Krsna without difficulty. Krsna se tomara, krsna
dite para. Krsna is the property of His pure devotee, and if we take shelter of a pure devotee, he can
deliver Krsna very easily. Prahlada wants to engage in the service of a devotee, and therefore he prays to
Krsna, "My dear Lord, kindly give me the shelter of Your very dear devotee so that I may engage in his
service and You may then be pleased." Mad-bhakta-pujabhyadhika (Bhag. 11.19.21). The Lord says,
"Engaging in the service of My devotee is better than trying to engage in My devotional service."
Another significant point in this verse is that by devotional service Prahlada Maharaja does not want to
benefit alone. Rather, he prays to the Lord that all of us fallen souls in this material world may, by the
grace of the Lord, engage in the service of His servant and thus be delivered. The grace of the Lord is not
at all difficult for the Lord to bestow, and thus Prahlada Maharaja wants to save the whole world by
spreading Krsna consciousness.
