fully conversant with religious principles; priya--pleasing; satya--truthful; vak--in speaking; apramatta--
attentive in service to her husband; sucih--always clean and pure; snigdha--affectionate; patim--the

TRANSLATION
A chaste woman should not be greedy, but satisfied in all circumstances. She must be very expert in
handling household affairs and should be fully conversant with religious principles. She should speak
pleasingly and truthfully and should be very careful and always clean and pure. Thus a chaste woman
should engage with affection in the service of a husband who is not fallen.
PURPORT
According to the injunction of Yajnavalkya, an authority on religious principles, asuddheh sampratiksyo
hi mahapataka-dusitah. One is considered contaminated by the reactions of great sinful activities when
one has not been purified according to the methods of the dasa-vidha-samskara. In Bhagavad-gita,
however, the Lord says, na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah: "Those miscreants who do
not surrender unto Me are the lowest of mankind." The word naradhama means "nondevotee." Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said, yei bhaje sei bada, abhakta--hina, chara. Anyone who is a devotee is
sinless. One who is not a devotee, however, is the most fallen and condemned. It is recommended,
therefore, that a chaste wife not associate with a fallen husband. A fallen husband is one who is addicted
to the four principles of sinful activity--namely illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication.
Specifically, if one is not a soul surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is understood to
be contaminated. Thus a chaste woman is advised not to agree to serve such a husband. It is not that a
chaste woman should be like a slave while her husband is naradhama, the lowest of men. Although the
duties of a woman are different from those of a man, a chaste woman is not meant to serve a fallen
husband. If her husband is fallen, it is recommended that she give up his association. Giving up the
association of her husband does not mean, however, that a woman should marry again and thus indulge
in prostitution. If a chaste woman unfortunately marries a husband who is fallen, she should live
separately from him. Similarly, a husband can separate himself from a woman who is not chaste according
to the description of the sastra. The conclusion is that a husband should be a pure Vaisnava and that a
woman should be a chaste wife with all the symptoms described in this regard. Then both of them will be
happy and make spiritual progress in Krsna consciousness.
