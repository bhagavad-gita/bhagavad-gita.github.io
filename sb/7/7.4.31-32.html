<h2>Translation</h2>
[The qualities of Maharaja Prahlada, the son of Hiranyakasipu, are described herewith.] He was
completely cultured as a qualified brahmana, having very good character and being determined to
understand the Absolute Truth. He had full control of his senses and mind. Like the Supersoul, he was
kind to every living entity and was the best friend of everyone. To respectable persons he acted exactly
like a menial servant, to the poor he was like a father, to his equals he was attached like a sympathetic
brother, and he considered his teachers, spiritual masters and older Godbrothers to be as good as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. He was completely free from unnatural pride that might have arisen
from his good education, riches, beauty, aristocracy and so on.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These are some of the qualifications of a Vaisnava. A Vaisnava is automatically a brahmana because a
Vaisnava has all the good qualities of a brahmana.
samo damas tapah saucam
ksantir arjavam eva ca
jnanam vijnanam astikyam
brahma-karma svabhava-jam
"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness--
these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work." (Bg. 18.42) These qualities are manifest in the
body of a Vaisnava. Therefore a perfect Vaisnava is also a perfect brahmana, as indicated here by the
words brahmanyah sila-sampannah. A Vaisnava is always determined to understand the Absolute Truth,
and to understand the Absolute Truth one needs to have full control over his senses and mind. Prahlada
Maharaja possessed all these qualities. A Vaisnava is always a well-wisher to everyone. The six Gosvamis,
for example, are described in this way: dhiradhira jana-priyau. They were popular with both the gentle
and the ruffians. A Vaisnava must be equal to everyone, regardless of one's position. Atmavat: a Vaisnava
should be like Paramatma. Isvarah sama-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati. Paramatma does not hate
anyone; indeed, He is in the heart of a brahmana, but he is also even in the heart of a pig. As the moon
never refuses to distribute its pleasing rays even to the home of a candala, a Vaisnava never refuses to act
for everyone's welfare. Therefore a Vaisnava is always obedient to the spiritual master (arya). The word
arya refers to one who is advanced in knowledge. One who is deficient in knowledge cannot be called
arya. At the present, however, the word arya is used to refer to those who are godless. This is the
unfortunate situation of Kali-yuga.
The word guru refers to the spiritual master who initiates his disciple into advancement in the science
of Krsna, or Krsna consciousness, as stated by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura (sri-bhagavanmantropadesake
gurav ity arthah).
