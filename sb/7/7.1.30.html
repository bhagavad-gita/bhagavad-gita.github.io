kamad dvesad bhayat snehad
yatha bhaktyesvare manah
avesya tad-agham hitva
bahavas tad-gatim gatah
<p></p>

kamat--from lust; dvesat--from hatred; bhayat--from fear; snehat--from affection; yatha--as well as;
bhaktya--by devotion; isvare--in the Supreme; manah--the mind; avesya--absorbing; tat--of that; agham--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Many, many persons have attained liberation simply by thinking of Krsna with great attention and
giving up sinful activities. This great attention may be due to lusty desires, inimical feelings, fear, affection
or devotional service. I shall now explain how one receives Krsna's mercy simply by concentrating one's
mind upon Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.33.39):
vikriditam vraja-vadhubhir idam ca visnoh
sraddhanvito 'nusrnuyad atha varnayed yah
bhaktim param bhagavati pratilabhya kamam
hrd-rogam asv apahinoty acirena dhirah
If a bona fide listener hears of Krsna's pastimes with the gopis, which seem to be lusty affairs, the lusty
desires in his heart, which constitute the heart disease of the conditioned soul, will be vanquished, and he
will become a most exalted devotee of the Lord. If one who hears of the gopis' lusty behavior with Krsna
becomes free from lusty desires, certainly the gopis who approached Krsna became free from all such
desires. Similarly, Sisupala and others who were very much envious of Krsna and who constantly thought
of Krsna became free from envy. Nanda Maharaja and mother Yasoda were fully absorbed in Krsna
consciousness because of affection. When the mind is somehow or other fully absorbed in Krsna, the
material part is very soon vanquished, and the spiritual part--attraction to Krsna--becomes manifest. This
indirectly confirms that if one thinks of Krsna enviously, simply because of thinking of Krsna he becomes
free from all sinful reactions and thus becomes a pure devotee. Examples of this are given in the following
verse.
