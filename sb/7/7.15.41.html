<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Transcendentalists who are advanced in knowledge compare the body, which is made by the order of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to a chariot. The senses are like the horses; the mind, the master of
the senses, is like the reins; the objects of the senses are the destinations; intelligence is the chariot driver;
and consciousness, which spreads throughout the body, is the cause of bondage in this material world.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
For a bewildered person in the materialistic way of life, the body, the mind and the senses, which are
engaged in sense gratification, are the cause of bondage to repeated birth, death, old age and disease. But
for one who is advanced in spiritual knowledge, the same body, senses and mind are the cause of
liberation. This is confirmed in the Katha Upanisad (1.3.3-4,9) as follows:
atmanam rathinam viddhi
sariram ratham eva ca
buddhim tu sarathim viddhi
manah pragraham eva ca
indriyani hayan ahur
visayams tesu gocaran
so 'dhvanah param apnoti
tad visnoh paramam padam
The soul is the occupant of the chariot of the body, of which the driver is the intelligence. The mind is
the determination to reach the destination, the senses are the horses, and the sense objects are also
included in that activity. Thus one can reach the destination, Visnu, who is paramam padam, the supreme
goal of life. In conditioned life the consciousness in the body is the cause of bondage, but the same
consciousness, when transformed into Krsna consciousness, becomes the cause for one's returning home,
back to Godhead.
The human body, therefore, may be used in two ways--for going to the darkest regions of ignorance or
for going forward, back home, back to Godhead. To go back to Godhead, the path is mahat-seva, to accept
the self-realized spiritual master. Mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh. For liberation, one should accept
the direction of authorized devotees who can actually endow one with perfect knowledge. On the other
hand, tamo-dvaram yositam sangi-sangam: if one wants to go to the darkest regions of material existence,
one may continue to associate with persons who are attached to women (yositam sangi-sangam). The
word yosit means "woman." Persons who are too materialistic are attached to women.
It is said, therefore, atmanam rathinam viddhi sariram ratham eva ca. The body is just like a chariot or
car in which one may go anywhere. One may drive well, or else one may drive whimsically, in which case
it is quite possible that he may have an accident and fall into a ditch. In other words, if one takes
directions from the experienced spiritual master one can go back home, back to Godhead; otherwise, one
may return to the cycle of birth and death. Therefore Krsna personally advises:
asraddadhanah purusa
dharmasyasya parantapa
aprapya mam nivartante
mrtyu-samsara-vartmani
"Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but
return to birth and death in this material world." (Bg. 9.3) The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
personally gives instructions on how one can return home, back to Godhead, but if one does not care to
listen to His instructions, the result will be that one will never go back to Godhead, but will continue life
in this miserable condition of repeated birth and death in material existence (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).
The advice of experienced transcendentalists, therefore, is that the body be fully engaged for achieving
the ultimate goal of life (svartha-gatim). The real interest or goal of life is to return home, back to
Godhead. To enable one to fulfill this purpose, there are so many Vedic literatures, including Vedantasutra,
the Upanisads, Bhagavad-gita, Mahabharata and the Ramayana. One should take lessons from these
Vedic literatures and learn how to practice nivrtti-marga. Then one's life will be perfect. The body is
important as long as it has consciousness. Without consciousness, the body is merely a lump of matter.
Therefore, to return home, back to Godhead, one must change his consciousness from material
consciousness to Krsna consciousness. One's consciousness is the cause of material bondage, but if this
consciousness is purified by bhakti-yoga, one can then understand the falsity of his upadhi, his
designations as Indian, American, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and so on. Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tatparatvena
nirmalam. One must forget these designations and use this consciousness only for the service of
Krsna. Therefore if one takes advantage of the Krsna consciousness movement, his life is certainly
successful.
