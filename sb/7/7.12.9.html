<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
nanv agnih pramada nama
ghrta-kumbha-samah puman
sutam api raho jahyad
anyada yavad-artha-krt
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nanu--certainly; agnih--the fire; pramada--the woman (one who bewilders the mind of man); nama--the
very name; ghrta-kumbha--a pot of butter; samah--like; puman--a man; sutam api--even one's daughter;
rahah--in a secluded place; jahyat--one must not associate with; anyada--with other women also; yavat--as
much as; artha-krt--required.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Woman is compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot. Therefore a man should avoid
associating even with his own daughter in a secluded place. Similarly, he should also avoid association
with other women. One should associate with women only for important business and not otherwise.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
If a butter pot and fire are kept together, the butter within the pot will certainly melt. Woman is
compared to fire, and man is compared to a butter pot. However advanced one may be in restraining the
senses, it is almost impossible for a man to keep himself controlled in the presence of a woman, even if
she is his own daughter, mother or sister. Indeed, his mind is agitated even if one is in the renounced
order of life. Therefore, Vedic civilization carefully restricts mingling between men and women. If one
cannot understand the basic principle of restraining association between man and woman, he is to be
considered an animal. That is the purport of this verse.
