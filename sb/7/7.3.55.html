katham tv ajata-paksams tan
matr-hinan bibharmy aham
manda-bhagyah pratiksante
nide me mataram prajah
SYNONYMS
katham--how; tu--but; ajata-paksan--who have not grown wings to fly; tan--them; matr-hinan--bereft of
their mother; bibharmi--shall maintain; aham--I; manda-bhagyah--very unfortunate; pratiksante--they
await; nide--in the nest; me--my; mataram--their mother; prajah--baby birds.
TRANSLATION
The unfortunate baby birds, bereft of their mother, are waiting in the nest for her to feed them. They are
still very small and have not yet grown their wings. How shall I be able to maintain them?
PURPORT
The bird is lamenting for the mother of his children because the mother naturally maintains and cares
for the children. Yamaraja, however, in the guise of a small boy, has already explained that although his
mother left him uncared for and wandering in the forest, the tigers and other ferocious animals had not
eaten him. The real fact is that if the Supreme Personality of Godhead protects one, even though one be
motherless and fatherless, one can be maintained by the good will of the Lord. Otherwise, if the Supreme
Lord does not give one protection, one must suffer in spite of the presence of his father and mother.
Another example is that sometimes a patient dies in spite of a good physician and good medicine. Thus
without the protection of the Lord one cannot live, with or without parents.
Another point in this verse is that fathers and mothers have protective feelings for their children even in
bird and beast society, not to speak of human society. Kali-yuga, however, is so degraded that a father and
mother even kill their children in the womb on the plea of their scientific knowledge that within the
womb the child has no life. Prestigious medical practitioners give this opinion, and therefore the father
and mother of this day kill their children within the womb. How degraded human society has become!
Their scientific knowledge is so advanced that they think that within the egg and the embryo there is no
life. Now these so-called scientists are receiving Nobel Prizes for advancing the theory of chemical
evolution. But if chemical combinations are the source of life, why don't the scientists manufacture
something like an egg through chemistry and put it in an incubator so that a chicken will come out? What
is their answer? With their scientific knowledge they are unable to create even an egg. Such scientists are
described in Bhagavad-gita as mayayapahrta jnanah, fools whose real knowledge has been taken away.
They are not men of knowledge, but they pose as scientists and philosophers, although their so-called
theoretical knowledge cannot produce practical results.
