<h2>Text</h2>
naivatmanah prabhur ayam nija-labha-purno
manam janad avidusah karuno vrnite
yad yaj jano bhagavate vidadhita manam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--nor; eva--certainly; atmanah--for His personal benefit; prabhuh--Lord; ayam--this; nija-labhapurnah--
is always satisfied in Himself (He does not need to be satisfied by the service of others); manam--
respect; janat--from a person; avidusah--who does not know that the aim of life is to please the Supreme
Lord; karunah--(the Supreme Personality of Godhead), who is so kind to this foolish, ignorant person;
vrnite--accepts; yat yat--whatever; janah--a person; bhagavate--unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
vidadhita--may offer; manam--worship; tat--that; ca--indeed; atmane--for his own benefit; pratimukhasya--
of the reflection of the face in the mirror; yatha--just as; mukha-srih--the decoration of the
face.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always fully satisfied in Himself. Therefore
when something is offered to Him, the offering, by the Lord's mercy, is for the benefit of the devotee, for
the Lord does not need service from anyone. To give an example, if one's face is decorated, the reflection
of one's face in a mirror is also seen to be decorated.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In bhakti-yoga it is recommended that a devotee follow nine principles; sravanam kirtanam visnoh
smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam. vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. This service of
glorifying the Lord by hearing, chanting and so on is not, of course, meant for the benefit of the Lord; this
devotional service is recommended for the benefit of the devotee. The Lord is always glorious, whether
the devotee glorifies Him or not, but if the devotee engages in glorifying the Lord, the devotee himself
automatically becomes glorious. Ceto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam. By glorifying
the Lord constantly, the living entity becomes purified in the core of his heart, and thus he can
understand that he does not belong to the material world but is a spirit soul whose actual activity is to
advance in Krsna consciousness so that he may become free from the material clutches. Thus the blazing
fire of material existence is immediately extinguished (bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam). A foolish
person is amazed that Krsna orders, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Abandon all
varieties of religious activities and just surrender unto Me." Some foolish scholars even say that this is too
much to demand. But this demand is not for the benefit of the Supreme personality of Godhead; rather, it
is for the benefit of human society. If human beings individually and collectively surrender everything to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead in full Krsna consciousness, all of human society will benefit. One
who does not dedicate everything to the Supreme Lord is described in this verse as avidusa, a rascal. In
Bhagavad-gita (7.15), the Lord Himself speaks in the same way:
na mam duskrtino mudhah
prapadyante naradhamah
mayayapahrta-jnana
asuram bhavamasritah
"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by
illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me." Because of
ignorance and misfortune, the atheists and the naradhamas, the lowest of men, do not surrender unto the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore although the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is full in Himself, He
appears in different yugas to demand the surrender of the conditioned souls so that they will benefit by
becoming free from the material clutches. In conclusion, the more we engage in Krsna consciousness and
render service unto the Lord, the more we benefit. Krsna does not need service from any of us.
