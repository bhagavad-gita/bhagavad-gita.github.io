bhutanam iha samvasah
prapayam iva suvrate
daivenaikatra nitanam
unnitanam sva-karmabhih
SYNONYMS
bhutanam--of all living entities; iha--in this material world; samvasah--the living together; prapayam--in
a place for drinking cold water; iva--like; su-vrate--O my gentle mother; daivena--by the superior
arrangement; ekatra--in one place; nitanam--of those brought; unnitanam--of those led apart; svakarmabhih--
by their own reactions.
TRANSLATION
My dear mother, in a restaurant or place for drinking cold water, many travelers are brought together,
and after drinking water they continue to their respective destinations. Similarly, living entities join
together in a family, and later, as a result of their own actions, they are led apart to their destinations.
PURPORT
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
"The bewildered soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer
of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27) All living entities act exactly
according to the directions of prakrti, material nature, because in the material world we are fully under a
higher control. All the living entities in this material world have come here only because they wanted to
be equal to Krsna in enjoyment and have thus been sent here to be conditioned by material nature in
different degrees. In the material world a so-called family is a combination of several persons in one home
to fulfill the terms of their imprisonment. As criminal prisoners scatter as soon as their terms are over and
they are released, all of us who have temporarily assembled as family members will continue to our
respective destinations. Another example given is that family members are like straws carried together by
the waves of a river. Sometimes such straws mix together in whirlpools, and later, dispersed again by the
same waves, they float alone in the water.
Although Hiranyakasipu was a demon, he had Vedic knowledge and understanding. Thus the advice
given to his family members--his sister-in-law, mother and nephews--was quite sound. The demons are
considered highly elevated in knowledge, but because they do not use their good intelligence for the
service of the Lord, they are called demons. The demigods, however, act very intelligently to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13) as follows:
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
"O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by
discharging his prescribed duties [dharma] according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the
Lord Hari." To become a demigod or to become godly, whatever one's occupation, one must satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
