<h2>Text</h2>
tri-vargam natikrcchrena
bhajeta grha-medhy api
yatha-desam yatha-kalam
yavad-daivopapaditam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tri-vargam--three principles, namely religiosity, economic development and sense gratification; na--not;
ati-krcchrena--by very severe endeavor; bhajeta--should execute; grha-medhi--a person interested only in
family life; api--although; yatha-desam--according to the place; yatha-kalam--according to the time;
yavat--as much as; daiva--by the grace of the Lord; upapaditam--obtained.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Even if one is a householder rather than a brahmacari, a sannyasi or a vanaprastha, one should not
endeavor very hard for religiosity, economic development or satisfaction of the senses. Even in
householder life, one should be satisfied to maintain body and soul together with whatever is available
with minimum endeavor, according to place and time, by the grace of the Lord. One should not engage
oneself in ugra-karma.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In human life there are four principles to be fulfilled--dharma, artha, kama and moksa (religion,
economic development, sense gratification, and liberation). First one should be religious, observing
various rules and regulations, and then one must earn some money for maintenance of his family and the
satisfaction of his senses. The most important ceremony for sense gratification is marriage because sexual
intercourse is one of the principal necessities of the material body. Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi
tuccham. Although sexual intercourse is not a very exalted requisite in life, both animals and men require
some sense gratification because of material propensities. One should be satisfied with married life and
not expend energy for extra sense gratification or sex life.
As for economic development, the responsibility for this should be entrusted mainly to the vaisyas and
grhasthas. Human society should be divided into varnas and asramas--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra,
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. Economic development is necessary for grhasthas.
Brahmana grhasthas should be satisfied with a life of adhyayana, adhyapana, yajana and yajana--being
learned scholars, teaching others to be scholars, learning how to worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Visnu, and also teaching others how to worship Lord Visnu, or even the demigods. A brahmana
should do this without remuneration, but he is allowed to accept charity from a person whom he teaches
how to be a human being. As for the ksatriyas, they are supposed to be the kings of the land, and the land
should be distributed to the vaisyas for agricultural activities, cow protection and trade. Sudras must
work; sometimes they should engage in occupational duties as cloth manufacturers, weavers, blacksmiths,
goldsmiths, brass-smiths, and so on, or else they should engage in hard labor to produce food grains.
These are the different occupational duties by which men should earn their livelihood, and in this way
human society should be simple. At the present moment, however, everyone is engaged in technological
advancement, which is described in Bhagavad-gita as ugra-karma--extremely severe endeavor. This ugrakarma
is the cause of agitation within the human mind. Men are engaging in many sinful activities and
becoming degraded by opening slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories, as well as nightclubs
and other establishments for sense enjoyment. In this way they are spoiling their lives. In all of these
activities, of course, householders are involved, and therefore it is advised here, with the use of the word
api, that even though one is a householder, one should not engage himself in severe hardships. One's
means of livelihood should be extremely simple. As for those who are not grhasthas--the brahmacaris,
vanaprasthas and sannyasis--they don't have to do anything but strive for advancement in spiritual life.
This means that three fourths of the entire population should stop sense gratification and simply be
engaged in the advancement of Krsna consciousness. Only one fourth of the population should be
grhastha, and that should be according to laws of restricted sense gratification. The grhasthas,
vanaprasthas, brahmacaris and sannyasis should endeavor together with their total energy to become
Krsna conscious. This type of civilization is called daiva-varnasrama. One of the objectives of the Krsna
consciousness movement is to establish this daiva-varnasrama, but not to encourage so-called varnasrama
without scientifically organized endeavor by human society.
