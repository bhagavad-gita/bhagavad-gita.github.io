<h2>Translation</h2>
How can a person who is most affectionate to his family, the core of his heart being always filled with
their pictures, give up their association? Specifically, a wife is always very kind and sympathetic and
always pleases her husband in a solitary place. Who could give up the association of such a dear and
affectionate wife? Small children talk in broken language, very pleasing to hear, and their affectionate
father always thinks of their sweet words. Mow could he give up their association? One's elderly parents
and one's sons and daughters are also very dear. A daughter is especially dear to her father, and while
living at her husband's house she is always in his mind. Who could give up that association? Aside from
this, in household affairs there are many decorated items of household furniture, and there are also
animals and servants. Who could give up such comforts? The attached householder is like a silkworm,
which weaves a cocoon in which it becomes imprisoned, unable to get out. Simply for the satisfaction of
two important senses--the genitals and the tongue--one is bound by material conditions. How can one
escape?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In household affairs the first attraction is the beautiful and pleasing wife, who increases household
attraction more and more. One enjoys his wife with two prominent sense organs, namely the tongue and
the genitals. The wife speaks very sweetly. This is certainly an attraction. Then she prepares very palatable
foods to satisfy the tongue, and when the tongue is satisfied one gains strength in the other sense organs,
especially the genitals. Thus the wife gives pleasure in sexual intercourse. Household life means sex life
(yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham). This is encouraged by the tongue. Then there are
children. A baby gives pleasure by speaking sweet words in broken language, and when the sons and
daughters are grown up one becomes involved in their education and marriage. Then there are one's own
father and mother to be taken care of, and one also becomes concerned with the social atmosphere and
with pleasing his brothers and sisters. A man becomes increasingly entangled in household affairs, so
much so that leaving them becomes almost impossible. Thus the household becomes grham andhakupam,
a dark well into which the man has fallen. For such a man to get out is extremely difficult unless
he is helped by a strong person, the spiritual master, who helps the fallen person with the strong rope of
spiritual instructions. A fallen person should take advantage of this rope, and then the spiritual master, or
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, will take him out of the dark well.
