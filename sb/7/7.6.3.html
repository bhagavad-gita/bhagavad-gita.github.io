<h2>Synonyms</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja continued: My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with
reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to
one's past fruitive activities. Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain
distress.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world, in any form of life, there is some so-called happiness and so-called distress. No
one invites distress in order to suffer, but still it comes. Similarly, even if we do not endeavor to obtain the
advantages of material happiness, we shall obtain them automatically. This happiness and distress are
obtainable in any form of life, without endeavor. Thus there is no need to waste time and energy fighting
against distress or working very hard for happiness. Our only business in the human form of life should
be to revive our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become qualified to
return home, back to Godhead. Material happiness and distress come as soon as we accept a material
body, regardless of what form. We cannot avoid such happiness and distress under any circumstances.
The best use of human life, therefore, lies in reviving our relationship with the Supreme Lord, Visnu.
