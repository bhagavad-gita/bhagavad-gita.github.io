<h2>Text</h2>
sa tvam hi nitya-vijitatma-gunah sva-dhamna
kalo vasi-krta-visrjya-visarga-saktih
cakre visrstam ajayesvara sodasare
nispidyamanam upakarsa vibho prapannam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--that one (the supreme independent person who, through His external energy, has created the
material mind, which is the cause of all suffering in this material world); tvam--You (are); hi--indeed;
nitya--eternally; vijita-atma--conquered; gunah--whose property of the intelligence; sva-dhamna--by Your
personal spiritual energy; kalah--the time element (which creates and annihilates); vasi-krta--brought
under Your control; visrjya--by which all effects; visarga--and causes; saktih--the energy; cakre--in the
wheel of time (the repetition of birth and death); visrstam--being thrown; ajaya--by Your external energy,
the mode of ignorance; isvara--O supreme controller; sodasa-are--with sixteen spokes (the five material
elements, the ten senses, and the leader of the senses, namely the mind); nispidyamanam--being crushed
(under that wheel); upakarsa--kindly take me (to the shelter of Your lotus feet); vibho--O supreme great;
prapannam--who am fully surrendered unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, O supreme great, You have created this material world of sixteen constituents, but You
are transcendental to their material qualities. In other words, these material qualities are under Your full
control, and You are never conquered by them. Therefore the time element is Your representation. My
Lord, O Supreme, no one can conquer You. As for me, however, I am being crushed by the wheel of time,
and therefore I surrender fully unto You. Now kindly take me under the protection of Your lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The wheel of material miseries is also a creation of the Supreme personality of Godhead, but He is not
under the control of the material energy. Rather, He is the controller of the material energy, whereas we,
the living entities, are under its control. When we give up our constitutional position (jivera 'svarupa'
haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa'), the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material energy and her
influence over the conditioned soul. Therefore He is the Supreme, and only He can deliver the
conditioned soul from the onslaught of material nature (mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te).
Maya, the external energy, continuously imposes upon the conditioned souls the suffering of the threefold
miseries of this material world. Therefore, in the previous verse, Prahlada Maharaja prayed to the Lord,
"But for Your Lordship, no one can save me." Prahlada Maharaja has also explained that a child's
protectors, his parents, cannot save the child from the onslaught of birth and death, nor can medicine and
a physician save one from death, nor can a boat or similar means of protection save a person drowning in
the water, for everything is controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore suffering
humanity must surrender to Krsna, as Krsna Himself demands in the last instruction of Bhagavad-gita
(18.66):
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.
Do not fear." All of human society must take advantage of this offer and thus be saved by Krsna from the
danger of being crushed by the wheel of time, the wheel of past, present and future.
The word nispidyamanam ("being crushed") is very significant. Every living entity in the material
condition is actually being crushed again and again, and to be saved from this position one must take
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then one will be happy. The word prapannam is also very
significant, for unless one fully surrenders to the Supreme Lord one cannot be saved from being crushed.
A criminal is put in prison and punished by the government, but the same government, if it likes, can
release the criminal from imprisoned life. Similarly, we must know conclusively that our material
condition of suffering has been allotted to us by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and if we want to
be saved from this suffering, we must appeal to the same controller. Thus one can be saved from this
material condition.
