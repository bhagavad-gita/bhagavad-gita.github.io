<h2>Text</h2>
susilo mita-bhug daksah
sraddadhano jitendriyah
yavad-artham vyavaharet
strisu stri-nirjitesu ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
su-silah--very polite and well behaved; mita-bhuk--eating only exactly what he needs, neither more nor
less; daksah--expert or without laziness, always busy; sraddadhanah--possessing full faith in the
instructions of the sastra and the spiritual master; jita-indriyah--having full control over the senses; yavatartham--
as much as necessary; vyavaharet--should behave externally; strisu--unto women; stri-nirjitesu--
men who are henpecked, controlled by women; ca--also.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A brahmacari should be quite well behaved and gentle and should not eat or collect more than
necessary. He must always be active and expert, fully believing in the instructions of the spiritual master
and the sastra. Fully controlling his senses, he should associate only as much as necessary with women or
those controlled by women.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A brahmacari should be very careful not to mix with women or with men addicted to women. Although
when he goes out to beg alms it is necessary to talk with women and with men very much attached to
women, this association should be very short, and he should talk with them only about begging alms, and
not more. A brahmacari should be very careful in associating with men who are attached to women.
