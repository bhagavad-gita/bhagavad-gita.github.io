<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja said: Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities,
paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Visnu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering
the Lord respectful worship with sixteen types of paraphernalia, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming
His servant, considering the Lord one's best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him (in other
words, serving Him with the body, mind and words)--these nine processes are accepted as pure
devotional service. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Krsna through these nine methods
should be understood to be the most learned person, for he has acquired complete knowledge.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Prahlada Maharaja was asked by his father to say something from whatever he had learned, he
considered that what he had learned from his spiritual master was the best of all teachings whereas what
he had learned about diplomacy from his material teachers, Sanda and Amarka, was useless. Bhaktih
paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag. 11.2.42). This is the symptom of pure devotional service. A pure
devotee is interested only in devotional service, not in material affairs. To execute devotional service, one
should always engage in hearing and chanting about Krsna, or Lord Visnu. The process of temple worship
is called arcana. How to perform arcana will be explained herein. One should have complete faith in the
words of Krsna, who says that He is the great well-wishing friend of everyone (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam).
A devotee considers Krsna the only friend. This is called sakhyam. Pumsarpita visnau. The word pumsa
means "by all living entities." There are no distinctions permitting only a man or only a brahmana to offer
devotional service to the Lord. Everyone can do so. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.32), striyo vaisyas
tatha sudras te 'pi yanti param gatim: although women, vaisyas and sudras are considered less intelligent,
they also can become devotees and return home, back to Godhead.
After performing sacrifices, sometimes a person engaged in fruitive activity customarily offers the results
to Visnu. But here it is said, bhagavaty addha: one must directly offer everything to Visnu. This is called
sannyasa (not merely nyasa). A tridandi-sannyasi carries three dandas, signifying kaya-mano-vakya--body,
mind and words. All of these should be offered to Visnu, and then one can begin devotional service.
Fruitive workers first perform some pious activities and then formally or officially offer the results to
Visnu. The real devotee, however, first offers his surrender to Krsna with his body, mind and words and
then uses his body, mind and words for the service of Krsna as Krsna desires.
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura gives the following explanation in his Tathya. The word sravana
refers to giving aural reception to the holy name and descriptions of the Lord's form, qualities, entourage
and pastimes as explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and similar authorized scriptures. After
aurally receiving such messages, one should memorize these vibrations and repeat them (kirtanam).
Smaranam means trying to understand more and more about the Supreme Lord, and pada-sevanam means
engaging oneself in serving the lotus feet of the Lord according to the time and circumstances. Arcanam
means worshiping Lord Visnu as one does in the temple, and vandanam means offering respectful
obeisances. Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru. Vandanam means namaskuru--
offering obeisances or offering prayers. Thinking oneself to be nitya-krsna-dasa, everlastingly a servant of
Krsna, is called dasyam, and sakhyam means being a well-wisher of Krsna. Krsna wants everyone to
surrender unto Him because everyone is constitutionally His servant. Therefore, as a sincere friend of
Krsna, one should preach this philosophy, requesting everyone to surrender unto Krsna. Atma-nivedanam
means offering Krsna everything, including one's body, mind, intelligence and whatever one may possess.
One's sincere endeavor to perform these nine processes of devotional service is technically called bhakti.
The word addha means "directly" One should not be like the karmis, who perform pious activities and
then formally offer the results to Krsna. That is karma-kanda. One should not aspire for the results of his
pious activities, but should dedicate oneself fully and then act piously. In other words, one should act for
the satisfaction of Lord Visnu, not for the satisfaction of his own senses. That is the meaning of the word
addha, "directly."
anyabhilasita-sunyam
jnana-karmady-anavrtam
anukulyena krsnanusilanam
bhaktir uttama
"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without
desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called
pure devotional service." One should simply satisfy Krsna, without being influenced by fruitive
knowledge or fruitive activity.
The Gopala-tapani Upanisad says that the word bhakti means engagement in the devotional service of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not of anyone else. This Upanisad describes that bhakti is the
offering of devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To perform devotional service,
one should be relieved of the bodily conception of life and aspirations to be happy through elevation to
the higher planetary systems. In other words, work performed simply for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Lord, without any desire for material benefits, is called bhakti. Bhakti is also called niskarma, or freedom
from the results of fruitive activity. Bhakti and niskarma are on the same platform, although devotional
service and fruitive activity appear almost the same.
The nine different processes enunciated by Prahlada Maharaja, who learned them from Narada Muni,
may not all be required for the execution of devotional service; if a devotee performs only one of these
nine without deviation, he can attain the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sometimes it is
found that when one performs one of the processes, other processes are mixed with it. That is not
improper for a devotee. When a devotee executes any one of the nine processes (nava-laksana), this is
sufficient; the other eight processes are included. Now let us discuss these nine different processes.
(1) Sravanam. Hearing of the holy name of the Lord (sravanam) is the beginning of devotional service.
Although any one of the nine processes is sufficient, in chronological order the hearing of the holy name
of the Lord is the beginning. Indeed, it is essential. As enunciated by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, cetodarpana-
marjanam: by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one is cleansed of the material conception of
life, which is due to the dirty modes of material nature. When the dirt is cleansed from the core of one's
heart, one can realize the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead--isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cidananda-
vigrahah. Thus by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one comes to the platform of understanding
the personal form of the Lord. After realizing the Lord's form, one can realize the transcendental qualities
of the Lord, and when one can understand His transcendental qualities one can understand the Lord's
associates. In this way a devotee advances further and further toward complete understanding of the Lord
as he awakens in realization of the Lord's holy name, transcendental form and qualities, His
paraphernalia, and everything pertaining to Him. Therefore the chronological process is sravanam
kirtanam visnoh. This same process of chronological understanding holds true in chanting and
remembering. When the chanting of the holy name, form, qualities and paraphernalia is heard from the
mouth of a pure devotee, his hearing and chanting are very pleasing. Srila Sanatana Gosvami has
forbidden us to hear the chanting of an artificial devotee or nondevotee.
Hearing from the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam is considered the most important process of hearing.
Srimad-Bhagavatam is full of transcendental chanting of the holy name, and therefore the chanting and
hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam are transcendentally full of mellows. The transcendental holy name of the
Lord may be heard and chanted accordingly to the attraction of the devotee. One may chant the holy
name of Lord Krsna, or one may chant the holy name of Lord Rama or Nrsimhadeva (ramadi-murtisu
kala-niyamena tisthan). The Lord has innumerable forms and names, and devotees may meditate upon a
particular form and chant the holy name according to his attraction. The best course is to hear of the holy
name, form and so on from a pure devotee of the same standard as oneself. In other words, one who is
attached to Krsna should chant and hear from other pure devotees who are also attached to Lord Krsna.
The same principle applies for devotees attracted by Lord Rama, Lord Nrsimha and other forms of the
Lord. Because Krsna is the ultimate form of the Lord (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam), it is best to hear about
Lord Krsna's name, form and pastimes from a realized devotee who is particularly attracted by the form of
Lord Krsna. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, great devotees like Sukadeva Gosvami have specifically described
Lord Krsna's holy name, form and qualities. Unless one hears about the holy name, form and qualities of
the Lord, one cannot clearly understand the other processes of devotional service. Therefore Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu recommends that one chant the holy name of Krsna. param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam. If
one is fortunate enough to hear from the mouth of realized devotees, he is very easily successful on the
path of devotional service. Therefore hearing of the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord is essential.
In Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.11) there is this verse:
tad-vag-visargo janatagha-viplavo
yasmin prati-slokam abaddhavaty api
namany anantasya yaso-'nkitani yat
srnvanti gayanti grnanti sadhavah
"Verses describing the name, form and qualities of Anantadeva, the unlimited Supreme Lord, are able to
vanquish all the sinful reactions of the entire world. Therefore even if such verses are improperly
composed, devotees hear them, describe them and accept them as bona fide and authorized." In this
connection, Sridhara Svami has remarked that a pure devotee takes advantage of another pure devotee by
trying to hear from him about the holy name, form and qualities of the Lord. If there is no such
opportunity, he alone chants and hears the Lord's holy name.
(2) Kirtanam. The hearing of the holy name has been described above. Now let us try to understand the
chanting of the holy name, which is the second item in the consecutive order. It is recommended that
such chanting be performed very loudly. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, Narada Muni says that without shame he
began traveling all over the world, chanting the holy name of the Lord. Similarly, Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu has advised:
trnad api sunicena
taror api sahisnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sada harih
A devotee can very peacefully chant the holy name of the Lord by behaving more humbly than the grass,
being tolerant like a tree and offering respects to everyone, without expecting honor from anyone else.
Such qualifications make it easier to chant the holy name of the Lord. The process of transcendental
chanting can be easily performed by anyone. Even if one is physically unfit, classified lower than others,
devoid of material qualifications or not at all elevated in terms of pious activities, the chanting of the holy
name is beneficial. An aristocratic birth, an advanced education, beautiful bodily features, wealth and
similar results of pious activities are all unnecessary for advancement in spiritual life, for one can very
easily advance simply by chanting the holy name. It is understood from the authoritative source of Vedic
literature that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, people are generally short-living, extremely bad in their
habits, and inclined to accept methods of devotional service that are not bona fide. Moreover, they are
always disturbed by material conditions, and they are mostly unfortunate. Under the circumstances, the
performance of other processes, such as yajna, dana, tapah and kriya--sacrifices, charity and so on--are not
at all possible. Therefore it is recommended:
harer nama harer nama
harer namaiva kevalam
kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha
"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting of the holy name of the
Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way." Simply by chanting the holy
name of the Lord, one advances perfectly in spiritual life. This is the best process for success in life. In
other ages, the chanting of the holy name is equally powerful, but especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is
most powerful. Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet: simply by chanting the holy name of
Krsna, one is liberated and returns home, back to Godhead. Therefore, even if one is able to perform other
processes of devotional service, one must adopt the chanting of the holy name as the principal method of
advancing in spiritual life. Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are very sharp in
their intelligence should adopt this process of chanting the holy names of the Lord. One should not,
however, manufacture different types of chanting. One should adhere seriously to the chanting of the holy
name as recommended in the scriptures: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
While chanting the holy name of the Lord, one should be careful to avoid ten offenses. From Sanatkumara
it is understood that even if a person is a severe offender in many ways, he is freed from offensive
life if he takes shelter of the Lord's holy name. Indeed, even if a human being is no better than a twolegged
animal, he will be liberated if he takes shelter of the holy name of the Lord. One should therefore
be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord's holy name. The offenses are described
as follows: (a) to blaspheme a devotee, especially a devotee engaged in broadcasting the glories of the holy
name, (b) to consider the name of Lord Siva or any other demigod to be equally as powerful as the holy
name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (no one is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
nor is anyone superior to Him), (c) to disobey the instructions of the spiritual master, (d) to blaspheme
the Vedic literatures and literatures compiled in pursuance of the Vedic literatures, (e) to comment that
the glories of the holy name of the Lord are exaggerated, (f) to interpret the holy name in a deviant way,
(g) to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, (h) to compare the chanting of
the holy name to pious activities, (i) to instruct the glories of the holy name to a person who has no
understanding of the chanting of the holy name, (j) not to awaken in transcendental attachment for the
chanting of the holy name, even after hearing all these scriptural injunctions.
There is no way to atone for any of these offenses. It is therefore recommended that an offender at the
feet of the holy name continue to chant the holy name twenty-four hours a day. Constant chanting of the
holy name will make one free of offenses, and then he will gradually be elevated to the transcendental
platform on which he can chant the pure holy name and thus become a lover of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
It is recommended that even if one commits offenses, one should continue chanting the holy name. In
other words, the chanting of the holy name makes one offenseless. In the book Nama-kaumudi it is
recommended that if one is an offender at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava, he should submit to that Vaisnava
and be excused; similarly, if one is an offender in chanting the holy name, he should submit to the holy
name and thus be freed from his offenses. In this connection there is the following statement, spoken by
Daksa to Lord Siva: "I did not know the glories of your personality, and therefore I committed an offense
at your lotus feet in the open assembly. You are so kind, however, that you did not accept my offense.
Instead, when I was falling down because of accusing you, you saved me by your merciful glance. You are
most great. Kindly excuse me and be satisfied with your own exalted qualities."
One should be very humble and meek to offer one's desires and chant prayers composed in glorification
of the holy name, such as ayi mukta-kulair upasya manam and nivrtta-tarsair upagiyamanad. One should
chant such prayers to become free from offenses at the lotus feet of the holy name.
(3) Smaranam. After one regularly performs the processes of hearing and chanting and after the core of
one's heart is cleansed, smaranam, remembering, is recommended. In Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.11)
Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Pariksit:
etan nirvidyamananam
icchatam akuto-bhayam
yoginam nrpa nirnitam
harer namanukirtanam
"O King, for great yogis who have completely renounced all material connections, for those who desire
all material enjoyment and for those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge, constant
chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended." According to different relationships with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are varieties of namanukirtanam, chanting of the holy name, and
thus according to different relationships and mellows there are five kinds of remembering. These are as
follows: (a) conducting research into the worship of a particular form of the Lord, (b) concentrating the
mind on one subject and withdrawing the mind's activities of thinking, feeling and willing from all other
subjects, (c) concentrating upon a particular form of the Lord (this is called meditation), (d)
concentrating one's mind continuously on the form of the Lord (this is called dhruvanusmrti, or perfect
meditation), and (e) awakening a likening for concentration upon a particular form (this is called
samadhi, or trance). Mental concentration upon particular pastimes of the Lord in particular
circumstances is also called remembrance. Therefore samadhi, trance, can be possible in five different
ways in terms of one's relationship. Specifically, the trance of devotees on the stage of neutrality is called
mental concentration.
(4) pada-sevanam. According to one's taste and strength, hearing, chanting and remembrance may be
followed by pada-sevanam. One obtains the perfection of remembering when one constantly thinks of the
lotus feet of the Lord. Being intensely attached to thinking of the Lord's lotus feet is called pada-sevanam.
When one is particularly adherent to the process of pada-sevanam, this process gradually includes other
processes, such as seeing the form of the Lord, touching the form of the Lord, circumambulating the form
or temple of the Lord, visiting such places as Jagannatha Puri, Dvaraka and Mathura to see the Lord's
form, and bathing in the Ganges or Yamuna. Bathing in the Ganges and serving a pure Vaisnava are also
known as tadiya-upasanam. This is also pada-sevanam. The word tadiya means "in relationship with the
Lord." Service to the Vaisnava, Tulasi, Ganges and Yamuna are included in pada-sevanam. All these
processes of pada-sevanam help one advance in spiritual life very quickly.
(5) Arcanam. After pada-sevanam comes the process of arcanam, worship of the Deity. If one is
interested in the process of arcanam, one must positively take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and
learn the process from him. There are many books for arcana, especially Narada-pancaratra. In this age,
the pancaratra system is particularly recommended for arcana, Deity worship. There are two systems of
arcana--the bhagavata system and pancaratriki system. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam there is no
recommendation of pancaratriki worship because in this Kali-yuga, even without Deity worship,
everything can be perfectly performed simply through hearing, chanting, remembering and worship of the
lotus feet of the Lord. Rupa Gosvami states:
sri-visnoh sravane pariksid abhavad vaiyasakih kirtane
prahladah smarane tad-anghri-bhajane laksmih prthuh pujane
akruras tv abhivandane kapi-patir dasye 'tha sakhye 'rjunah
sarvasvatma-nivedane balir abhut krsnaptir esam param
"Pariksit Maharaja attained salvation simply by hearing, and Sukadeva Gosvami attained salvation
simply by chanting. Prahlada Maharaja attained salvation by remembering the Lord. The goddess of
fortune, Laksmidevi, attained perfection by worshiping the Lord's lotus feet. Prthu Maharaja attained
salvation by worshiping the Deity of the Lord. Akrura attained salvation by offering prayers, Hanuman by
rendering service, Arjuna by establishing friendship with the Lord, and Bali Maharaja by offering
everything to the service of the Lord." All these great devotees served the Lord according to a particular
process, but every one of them attained salvation and became eligible to return home, back to Godhead.
This is explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam.
It is therefore recommended that initiated devotees follow the principles of Narada-pancaratra by
worshiping the Deity in the temple. Especially for householder devotees who are opulent in material
possessions, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. An opulent householder devotee who
does not engage his hard-earned money in the service of the Lord is called a miser. One should not engage
paid brahmanas to worship the Deity. If one does not personally worship the Deity but engages paid
servants instead, he is considered lazy, and his worship of the Deity is called artificial. An opulent
householder can collect luxurious paraphernalia for Deity worship, and consequently for householder
devotees the worship of the Deity is compulsory. In our Krsna consciousness movement there are
brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis, but the Deity worship in the temple should be
performed especially by the householders. The brahmacaris can go with the sannyasis to preach, and the
vanaprasthas should prepare themselves for the next status of renounced life, sannyasa. Grhastha
devotees, however, are generally engaged in material activities, and therefore if they do not take to Deity
worship, their falling down is positively assured. Deity worship means following the rules and regulations
precisely. That will keep one steady in devotional service. Generally householders have children, and then
the wives of the householders should be engaged in caring for the children, just as women acting as
teachers care for the children in a nursery school.
Grhastha devotees must adopt the arcana-vidhi, or Deity worship according to the suitable
arrangements and directions given by the spiritual master. Regarding those unable to take to the Deity
worship in the temple, there is the following statement in the Agni Purana. Any householder devotee
circumstantially unable to worship the Deity must at least see the Deity worship, and in this way he may
achieve success also. The special purpose of Deity worship is to keep oneself always pure and clean.
Grhastha devotees should be actual examples of cleanliness.
Deity worship should be continued along with hearing and chanting. Therefore every mantra is
preceded by the word namah. In all the mantras there are specific potencies, of which the grhastha
devotees must take advantage. There are many mantras preceded by the word namah, but if one chants
the holy name of the Lord, he receives the result of chanting namah many times. By chanting the holy
name of the Lord, one can reach the platform of love of Godhead. One might ask, then what is the
necessity of being initiated? The answer is that even though the chanting of the holy name is sufficient to
enable one to progress in spiritual life to the standard of love of Godhead, one is nonetheless susceptible
to contamination because of possessing a material body. Consequently, special stress is given to the
arcana-vidhi. One should therefore regularly take advantage of both the bhagavata process and
pancaratriki process.
Deity worship has two divisions, namely pure and mixed with fruitive activities. For one who is steady,
Deity worship is compulsory. Observing the various types of festivals, such as Sri Janmastami, Ramanavami
and Nrsimha-caturdasi, is also included in the process of Deity worship. In other words, it is
compulsory for householder devotees to observe these festivals.
Now let us discuss the offenses in Deity worship. The following are offenses: (a) to enter the temple
with shoes or being carried on a palanquin, (b) not to observe the prescribed festivals, (c) to avoid
offering obeisances in front of the Deity, (d) to offer prayers in an unclean state, not having washed one's
hands after eating, (e) to offer obeisances with one hand, (f) to circumambulate directly in front of the
Deity, (g) to spread one's legs before the Deity, (h) to sit before the Deity while holding one's ankles with
one's hands, (i) to lie down before the Deity, (j) to eat before the Deity, (k) to speak lies before the Deity,
(l) to address someone loudly before the Deity, (m) to talk nonsense before the Deity, (n) to cry before
the Deity, (o) to argue before the Deity, (p) to chastise someone before the Deity, (q) to show someone
favor before the Deity, (r) to use harsh words before the Deity, (s) to wear a woolen blanket before the
Deity, (t) to blaspheme someone before the Deity, (u) to worship someone else before the Deity, (v) to
use vulgar language before the Deity, (w) to pass air before the Deity, (x) to avoid very opulent worship of
the Deity, even though one is able to perform it, (y) to eat something not offered to the Deity, (z) to avoid
offering fresh fruits to the Deity according to the season, (aa) to offer food to the Deity which has already
been used or from which has first been given to others (in other words, food should not be distributed to
anyone else until it has been offered to the Deity), (bb) to sit with one's back toward the Deity, (cc) to
offer obeisances to someone else in front of the Deity, (dd) not to chant proper prayers when offering
obeisances to the spiritual master, (ee) to praise oneself before the Deity, and (ff) to blaspheme the
demigods. In the worship of the Deity, these thirty-two offenses should be avoided.
In the Varaha Purana the following offenses are mentioned: (a) to eat in the house of a rich man, (b) to
enter the Deity's room in the dark, (c) to worship the Deity without following the regulative principles,
(d) to enter the temple without vibrating any sound, (e) to collect food that has been seen by a dog, (f) to
break silence while offering worship to the Deity, (g) to go to the toilet during the time of worshiping the
Deity, (h) to offer incense without offering flowers, (i) to worship the Deity with forbidden flowers, (j) to
begin worship without having washed one's teeth, (k) to begin worship after sex, (l) to touch a lamp, dead
body or a woman during her menstrual period, or to put on red or bluish clothing, unwashed clothing,
the clothing of others or soiled clothing. Other offenses are to worship the Deity after seeing a dead body,
to pass air before the Deity, to show anger before the Deity, and to worship the Deity just after returning
from a crematorium. After eating, one should not worship the Deity until one has digested his food, nor
should one touch the Deity or engage in any Deity worship after eating safflower oil or hing. These are
also offenses.
In other places, the following offenses are listed: (a) to be against the scriptural injunctions of the Vedic
literature or to disrespect within one's heart the Srimad-Bhagavatam while externally falsely accepting its
principles, (b) to introduce differing sastras, (c) to chew pan and betel before the Deity, (d) to keep
flowers for worship on the leaf of a castor oil plant, (e) to worship the Deity in the afternoon, (f) to sit on
the altar or to sit on the floor to worship the Deity (without a seat), (g) to touch the Deity with the left
hand while bathing the Deity, (h) to worship the Deity with a stale or used flower, (i) to spit while
worshiping the Deity, (j) to advertise one's glory while worshiping the Deity, (k) to apply tilaka to one's
forehead in a curved way, (l) to enter the temple without having washed one's feet, (m) to offer the Deity
food cooked by an uninitiated person, (n) to worship the Deity and offer bhoga to the Deity within the
vision of an uninitiated person or non-Vaisnava, (o) to offer worship to the Deity without worshiping
Vaikuntha deities like Ganesa, (p) to worship the Deity while perspiring, (q) to refuse flowers offered to
the Deity, (r) to take a vow or oath in the holy name of the Lord.
If one commits any of the above offenses, one must read at least one chapter of Bhagavad-gita. This is
confirmed in the Skanda-Purana, Avanti-khanda. Similarly, there is another injunction, stating that one
who reads the thousand names of Visnu can be released from all offenses. In the same Skanda-Purana,
Reva-khanda, it is said that one who recites prayers to tulasi or sows a tulasi seed is also freed from all
offenses. Similarly, one who worships the salagrama-sila can also be relieved of offenses. In the Brahmanda
Purana it is said that one who worships Lord Visnu, whose four hands bear a conchshell, disc, lotus
flower and club, can be relieved from the above offenses. In the Adi-varaha Purana it is said that a
worshiper who has committed offenses may fast for one day at the holy place known as Saukarava and
then bathe in the Ganges.
In the process of worshiping the Deity it is sometimes enjoined that one worship the Deity within the
mind. In the padma purana, Uttara-khanda, it is said, "All persons can generally worship within the
mind." The Gautamiya Tantra states, "For a sannyasi who has no home, worship of the Deity within the
mind is recommended." In the Narada-pancaratra it is stated by Lord Narayana that worship of the Deity
within the mind is called manasa-puja, One can become free from the four miseries by this method.
Sometimes worship from the mind can be independently executed. According to the instruction of
Avirhotra Muni, one of the nava-yogendras, as mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam, one may worship the
Deity by chanting all the mantras. Eight kinds of Deities are mentioned in the sastra, and the mental Deity
is one of them. In this regard, the following description is given in the Brahma-vaivarta Purana.
In the city of Pratisthana-pura, long ago, there resided a brahmana who was poverty-stricken but
innocent and not dissatisfied. One day he heard a discourse in an assembly of brahmanas concerning how
to worship the Deity in the temple. In that meeting, he also heard that the Deity may be worshiped within
the mind. After this incident, the brahmana, having bathed in the Godavari River, began mentally
worshiping the Deity. He would wash the temple within his mind, and then in his imagination he would
bring water from all the sacred rivers in golden and silver waterpots. He collected all kinds of valuable
paraphernalia for worship, and he worshiped the Deity very gorgeously, beginning from bathing the Deity
and ending with offering arati. Thus he felt great happiness. After many years had passed in this way, one
day within his mind he cooked nice sweet rice with ghee to worship the Deity. He placed the sweet rice
on a golden dish and offered it to Lord Krsna, but he felt that the sweet rice was very hot, and therefore he
touched it with his finger. He immediately felt that his finger had been burned by the hot sweet rice, and
thus he began to lament. While the brahmana was in pain, Lord Visnu in Vaikuntha began smiling, and
the goddess of fortune inquired from the Lord why He was smiling. Lord Visnu then ordered His
associates to bring the brahmana to Vaikuntha. Thus the brahmana attained the liberation of samipya, the
facility of living near the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
(6) Vandanam. Although prayers are a part of Deity worship, they may be considered separately like the
other items, such as hearing and chanting, and therefore separate statements are given herewith. The Lord
has unlimited transcendental qualities and opulences, and one who feels influenced by the Lord's qualities
in various activities offers prayers to the Lord. In this way he becomes successful. In this connection, the
following are some of the offenses to be avoided: (a) to offer obeisances on one hand, (b) to offer
obeisances with one's body covered, (c) to show one's back to the Deity, (d) to offer obeisances on the left
side of the Deity, (e) to offer obeisances very near the Deity.
(7) Dasyam. There is the following statement in regard to assisting the Lord as a servant. After many,
many thousands of births, when one comes to understand that he is an eternal servant of Krsna, one can
deliver others from this universe. If one simply continues to think that he is an eternal servant of Krsna,
even without performing any other process of devotional service, he can attain full success, for simply by
this feeling one can perform all nine processes of devotional service.
(8) Sakhyam. In regard to worshiping the Lord as a friend, the Agastya-samhita states that a devotee
engaged in performing devotional service by sravanam and kirtanam sometimes wants to see the Lord
personally, and for this purpose he resides in the temple. Elsewhere there is this statement: "O my Lord,
Supreme Personality and eternal friend, although You are full of bliss and knowledge, You have become
the friend of the residents of Vrndavana. How fortunate are these devotees!" In this statement the word
"friend" is specifically used to indicate intense love. Friendship, therefore, is better than servitude. In the
stage above dasya-rasa, the devotee accepts the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a friend. This is not at
all astonishing, for when a devotee is pure in heart the opulence of his worship of the Deity diminishes as
spontaneous love for the Personality of Godhead is manifested. In this regard, Sridhara Svami mentions
Sridama Vipra, who expressed to himself his feelings of obligation, thinking, "Life after life, may I be
connected with Krsna in this friendly attitude."
(9) Atma-nivedanam. The word Atma-nivedanam refers to the stage at which one who has no motive
other than to serve the Lord surrenders everything to the Lord and performs his activities only to please
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Such a devotee is like a cow that is cared for by its master. When
cared for by its master, a cow is not in anxiety over its maintenance. Such a cow is always devoted to its
master, and it never acts independently, but only for the master's benefit. Some devotees, therefore,
consider dedication of the body to the Lord to be atma-nivedanam, and as stated in the book known as
Bhakti-viveka, sometimes dedication of the soul to the Lord is called atma-nivedanam. The best examples
of atma-nivedanam are found in Bali Maharaja and Ambarisa Maharaja. Atma-nivedanam is also
sometimes found in the behavior of Rukminidevi at Dvaraka.
