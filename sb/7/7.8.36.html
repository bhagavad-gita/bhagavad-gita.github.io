tada puman mukta-samasta-bandhanas
tad-bhava-bhavanukrtasayakrtih
nirdagdha-bijanusayo mahiyasa
bhakti-prayogena samety adhoksajam
SYNONYMS
tada--at that time; puman--the living entity; mukta--liberated; samasta-bandhanah--from all material
obstacles on the path of devotional service; tat-bhava--of the situation of the Supreme Lord's activities;
bhava--by thinking; anukrta--made similar; asaya-akrtih--whose mind and body; nirdagdha--completely
burned up; bija--the seed or original cause of material existence; anusayah--desire; mahiyasa--very
powerful; bhakti--of devotional service; prayogena--by the application; sameti--achieves; adhoksajam--the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of the material mind and knowledge.
TRANSLATION
The devotee is then freed from all material contamination because he constantly thinks of the Lord's
pastimes and because his mind and body have been converted to spiritual qualities. Because of his intense
devotional service, his ignorance, material consciousness and all kinds of material desires are completely
burnt to ashes. This is the stage at which one can achieve the shelter of the Lord's lotus feet.
PURPORT
When a devotee is completely purified, he becomes anyabhilasita-sunya. In other words, all of his
material desires become zero, being burnt to ashes, and he exists either as the Lord's servant, friend,
father, mother or conjugal lover. Because one thinks constantly in this way, one's present material body
and mind are fully spiritualized, and the needs of one's material body completely vanish from one's
existence. An iron rod put into a fire becomes warmer and warmer, and when it is red hot it is no longer
an iron rod but fire. Similarly, when a devotee constantly engages in devotional service and thinks of the
Lord in his original Krsna consciousness, he no longer has any material activities, for his body is
spiritualized. Advancement in Krsna consciousness is very powerful, and therefore even during this life
such a devotee has achieved the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. This transcendental ecstatic existence
of a devotee was completely exhibited by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya
writes as follows:
tad-bhava-bhavah tad yatha svarupam bhaktih
kecid bhakta vinrtyanti gayanti ca yathepsitam
kecit tusnim japanty eva kecit sobhaya-karinah
The ecstatic condition of devotional service was completely exhibited by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who
sometimes danced, sometimes cried, sometimes sang, sometimes remained silent, and sometimes chanted
the holy name of the Lord. That is perfect spiritual existence.
