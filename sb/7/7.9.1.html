<h2>Text</h2>

evam suradayah sarve
brahma-rudra-purah sarah
nopaitum asakan manyusamrambham
sudurasadam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-narada uvaca--the great saintly sage Narada Muni said; evam--thus; sura-adayah--the groups of
demigods; sarve--all; brahma-rudra-purah sarah--represented by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva; na--not;
upaitum--to go before the Lord; asakan--able; manyu-samrambham--in a completely angry mood; sudurasadam--
very difficult to approach (Lord Nrsimhadeva).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great saint Narada Muni continued: The demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and other
great demigods, dared not come forward before the Lord, who at that time was extremely angry.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung in his prema-bhakti-candrika, 'krodha' bhakta-dvesi jane: anger
should be used to punish a demon who is envious of devotees. Kama, krodha, lobha, moha, mada and
matsarya--lust, anger, greed, illusion, pride and envy--all have their proper use for the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and His devotee. A devotee of the Lord cannot tolerate blasphemy of the Lord or
His other devotees, and the Lord also cannot tolerate blasphemy of a devotee. Thus Lord Nrsimhadeva
was so very angry that the great demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva and even the goddess of
fortune, who is the Lord's constant companion, could not pacify Him, even after offering prayers of
glorification and praise. No one was able to pacify the Lord in His anger, but because the Lord was willing
to exhibit His affection for Prahlada Maharaja, all the demigods and the others present before the Lord
pushed Prahlada Maharaja forward to pacify Him.
