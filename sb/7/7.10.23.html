pitryam ca sthanam atistha
yathoktam brahmavadibhih
mayy avesya manas tata
kuru karmani mat-parah
<p></p>

pitryam--paternal; ca--also; sthanam--place, throne; atistha--sit upon; yatha-uktam--as described;
brahmavadibhih--by the followers of Vedic civilization; mayi--unto Me; avesya--being fully absorbed;

<h2>Translation</h2>
After performing the ritualistic ceremonies, take charge of your father's kingdom. Sit upon the throne
and do not be disturbed by materialistic activities. Please keep your mind fixed upon Me. Without
transgressing the injunctions of the Vedas, as a matter of formality you may perform your particular
duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one becomes a devotee, he no longer has any duty to the Vedic regulative principles. One has
many duties to perform, but if one becomes fully devoted to the Lord, he no longer has any such
obligations. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.41):
devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam
na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan
sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam
gato mukundam parihrtya kartam
One who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord is no longer a debtor to his forefathers, the
great sages, human society, the common man or any living entity.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead nonetheless advised Prahlada Maharaja to follow the regulative
principles, for since he was going to be the king, others would follow his example. Thus Lord
Nrsimhadeva advised Prahlada Maharaja to engage in his political duties so that people would become the
Lord's devotees.
yad yad acarati sresthas
tad tad evetaro janah
sa yat pramanam kurute
lokas tad anuvartate
"Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow. And whatever standards he sets by
exemplary acts, all the world pursues." (Bg. 3.21) One should not be attached to any materialistic
activities, but a devotee may perform such activities as an example to show the common man that one
should not deviate from the Vedic injunctions.
