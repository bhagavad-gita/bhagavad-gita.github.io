<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira further inquired: How was it possible for a father to be so violent toward an
exalted son who was obedient, well-behaved and respectful to his father? O brahmana, O master, I have
never heard of such a contradiction as an affectionate father's punishing his noble son with the intention
of killing him. Kindly dissipate our doubts in this regard.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the history of human society, an affectionate father is rarely found to chastise a noble and devoted
son. Therefore Maharaja Yudhisthira wanted Narada Muni to dissipate his doubt.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "Hiranyakasipu Terrorizes the Universe."
Chapter Five
Prahlada Maharaja, the Saintly Son of Hiranyakasipu
Prahlada Maharaja did not carry out the orders of his teachers, for he was always engaged in worshiping
Lord Visnu. As described in this chapter, Hiranyakasipu tried to kill Prahlada Maharaja, even by having a
snake bite him and by putting him under the feet of elephants, yet he was unsuccessful.
Hiranyakasipu's spiritual master, Sukracarya, had two sons named Sanda and Amarka, to whom
Prahlada Maharaja was entrusted for education. Although the teachers tried to educate the boy Prahlada
in politics, economics and other material activities, he did not care for their instructions. Instead, he
continued to be a pure devotee. Prahlada Maharaja never liked the idea of discriminating between one's
friends and enemies. Because he was spiritually inclined, he was equal toward everyone.
Once upon a time, Hiranyakasipu inquired from his son what the best thing was that he had learned
from his teachers. Prahlada Maharaja replied that a man engrossed in the material consciousness of
duality, thinking, "This is mine, and that belongs to my enemy," should give up his householder life and
go to the forest to worship the Supreme Lord.
When Hiranyakasipu heard from his son about devotional service, he decided that this small boy had
been polluted by some friend in school. Thus he advised the teachers to take care of the boy so that he
would not become a Krsna conscious devotee. However, when the teachers inquired from Prahlada
Maharaja why he was going against their teachings, Prahlada Maharaja taught the teachers that the
mentality of ownership is false and that he was therefore trying to become an unalloyed devotee of Lord
Visnu. The teachers, being very angry at this answer, chastised and threatened the boy with many fearful
conditions. They taught him to the best of their ability and then brought him before his father.
Hiranyakasipu affectionately took his son Prahlada on his lap and then inquired from him what the best
thing was that he had learned from his teachers. As usual, Prahlada Maharaja began praising the nine
processes of devotional service, such as sravanam and kirtanam. Thus the King of the demons,
Hiranyakasipu, being extremely angry, chastised the teachers, Sanda and Amarka, for having wrongly
trained Prahlada Maharaja. The so-called teachers informed the King that Prahlada Maharaja was
automatically a devotee and did not listen to their instructions. When they proved themselves innocent,
Hiranyakasipu inquired from Prahlada where he had learned visnu-bhakti. Prahlada Maharaja replied that
those who are attached to family life do not develop Krsna consciousness, either personally or collectively.
Instead, they suffer repeated birth and death in this material world and continue simply chewing the
chewed. Prahlada explained that the duty of every man is to take shelter of a pure devotee and thus
become eligible to understand Krsna consciousness.
Enraged at this answer, Hiranyakasipu threw Prahlada Maharaja from his lap. Since Prahlada was so
treacherous that he had become a devotee of Visnu, who had killed his uncle Hiranyaksa, Hiranyakasipu
asked his assistants to kill him. The assistants of Hiranyakasipu struck Prahlada with sharp weapons,
threw him under the feet of elephants, subjected him to hellish conditions, threw him from the peak of a
mountain and tried to kill him in thousands of other ways, but they were unsuccessful. Hiranyakasipu
therefore became increasingly afraid of his son Prahlada Maharaja and arrested him. The sons of
Hiranyakasipu's spiritual master, Sukracarya, began teaching Prahlada in their own way, but Prahlada
Maharaja did not accept their instructions. While the teachers were absent from the classroom, Prahlada
Maharaja began to preach Krsna consciousness in the school, and by his instructions all his class friends,
the sons of the demons, became devotees like him.
