While I am engaged in the business of killing Lord Visnu, go down to the planet earth, which is
flourishing due to brahminical culture and a ksatriya government. These people engage in austerity,
sacrifice, Vedic study, regulative vows, and charity. Destroy all the people thus engaged!
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu's main purpose was to disturb the demigods. He planned first to kill Lord Visnu so that
with Lord Visnu's death the demigods would automatically weaken and die. Another of his plans was to
disturb the residents of the planet earth. The peace and prosperity of the residents of earth, and all the
other planets, were maintained by the brahmanas and ksatriyas. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13),
catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: "According to the three modes of material nature
and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me." On all the
planets there are different types of residents, but the Lord recommends, referring especially to the planet
earth, which is inhabited by human beings, that society be divided into four varnas--brahmana, ksatriya,
vaisya and sudra. Before the advent of Lord Krsna on this earth, it is understood that the earth was
managed by the brahmanas and ksatriyas. The duty of the brahmanas is to cultivate samah (peacefulness),
damah (self-control), titiksa (tolerance), satyam (truthfulness), saucam (cleanliness) and arjavam
(simplicity), and then to advise the ksatriya kings how to rule the country or planet. Following the
instructions of the brahmanas, the ksatriyas should engage the populace in austerity, sacrifices, Vedic
study and adherence to the rules and regulations established by Vedic principles. They should also
arrange for charity to be given to the brahmanas, sannyasis and temples. This is the godly arrangement of
brahminical culture.
People are inclined to offer yajna because unless sacrifices are offered there will be insufficient rain
(yajnad bhavati parjanyah), which will hamper agricultural activities (parjanyad anna-sambhavah). By
introducing brahminical culture, therefore, a ksatriya government should engage people in performing
yajna, studying the Vedas and giving charity. Thus the people will receive their necessities for life very
easily, and there will be no disturbances in society. In this regard, Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita
(3.12):
istan bhogan hi vo deva
dasyante yajna-bhavitah
tair dattan apradayaibhyo
yo bhunkte stena eva sah
"In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajna
[sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the
demigods in return, is certainly a thief."
The demigods are authorized supplying agents who act on behalf of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Visnu. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yajnas. In the Vedas,
there are different kinds of yajnas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead
is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons
concerned, different types of yajnas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also
on the same basis--namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are
recommended to worship the goddess Kali, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess
the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those in the mode of goodness, the transcendental
worship of Visnu is recommended. Ultimately, all yajnas are meant for gradual promotion to the
transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yajnas, known as panca-mahayajna, are necessary.
One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that human society requires are supplied by
the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Consider, for example, all the eatables
of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk and sugar for persons in the mode
of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, such as meats, none of which can be manufactured
by men. Then again, take for example, heat, light, water and air, which are also necessities of life--none of
them can be manufactured by human society. Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse
sunlight, moonlight, rainfall or breeze, without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependent on
supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like
metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese and so many essentials--all of which are supplied by the agents of the
Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the
purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material
struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yajnas. If we forget the purpose of
human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more
and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become
thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be
happy, for they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are
simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajnas. Lord
Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajna, namely the sankirtana-yajna, which can
be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Krsna consciousness.
Hiranyakasipu planned to kill the inhabitants of earth so that yajna would stop and the demigods, being
disturbed, would die automatically when Lord Visnu, the yajnesvara, was killed. These were the demoniac
plans of Hiranyakasipu, who was expert in such activities.
