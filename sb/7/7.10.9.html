<h2>Text</h2>
vimuncati yada kaman
manavo manasi sthitan
tarhy eva pundarikaksa
bhagavattvaya kalpate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vimuncati--gives up; yada--whenever; kaman--all material desires; manavah--human society; manasi--
within the mind; sthitan--situated; tarhi--at that time only; eva--indeed; pundarika-aksa--O lotus-eyed
Lord; bhagavattvaya--to be equally as opulent as the Lord; kalpate--becomes eligible.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, when a human being is able to give up all the material desires in his mind, he becomes
eligible to possess wealth and opulence like Yours.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Atheistic men sometimes criticize a devotee by saying, "If you do not want to take any benediction from
the Lord and if the servant of the Lord is as opulent as the Lord Himself, why do you ask for the
benediction of being engaged as the Lord's servant?" Sridhara Svami comments, bhagavattvaya bhagavatsaman
aisvaryaya. Bhagavattva, becoming as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not mean
becoming one with Him or equal to Him, although in the spiritual world the servant is equally as opulent
as the master. The servant of the Lord is engaged in the service of the Lord as a servant, friend, father,
mother or conjugal lover, all of whom are equally as opulent as the Lord. This is acintya-bhedabhedatattva.
The master and servant are different yet equal in opulence. This is the meaning of simultaneous
difference from the Supreme Lord and oneness with Him.
