<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You are always transcendentally situated on the other side of the river of death, but
because of the reactions of our own activities, we are suffering on this side. Indeed, we have fallen into
this river and are repeatedly suffering the pains of birth and death and eating horrible things. Now kindly
look upon us--not only upon me but also upon all others who are suffering--and by Your causeless mercy
and compassion, deliver us and maintain us.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja, a pure Vaisnava, prays to the Lord not only for himself but for all other suffering
living entities. There are two classes of Vaisnavas--the bhajananandis and gosthy-anandis. The
bhajananandis worship the Lord only for their own personal benefit, but the gosthy-anandis try to elevate
all others to Krsna consciousness so that they may be saved. Fools who cannot perceive repeated birth and
death and the other miseries of materialistic life cannot be sure of what will happen to them in their next
birth. Indeed, these foolish, materially contaminated rascals have manufactured an irresponsible way of
life that does not consider the next life. They do not know that according to one's own activities, one
receives a body selected from 8,400,000 species. These rascals have been described in Bhagavad-gita as
duskrtino mudhah. Nondevotees, those who are not Krsna conscious, must engage in sinful activities, and
therefore they are mudhas--fools and rascals. They are such fools that they do not know what will happen
to them in their next life. Although they see varieties of living creatures eating abominable things--pigs
eating stool, crocodiles eating all kinds of flesh, and so on--they do not realize that they themselves,
because of their practice of eating all kinds of nonsense in this life, will be destined to eat the most
abominable things in their next life. A Vaisnava is always afraid of such an abominable life, and to free
himself from such horrible conditions, he engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord
is compassionate to them, and therefore He appears for their benefit.
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." (Bg. 4.7) The Lord is always ready to help
the fallen souls, but because they are fools and rascals, they do not take to Krsna consciousness and abide
by the instructions of Krsna. Therefore although Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is personally the Supreme
Lord, Krsna, He comes as a devotee to preach the Krsna consciousness movement. Yare dekha, tare kaha
'krsna'-upadesa. One must therefore become a sincere servant of Krsna. Amara ajnaya guru hana tara' ei
desa (Cc. Madhya 7.128). One should become a guru and spread Krsna consciousness all over the world,
simply by preaching the teachings of Bhagavad-gita.
