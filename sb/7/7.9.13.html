<h2>Text</h2>
sarve hy ami vidhi-karas tava sattva-dhamno
brahmadayo vayam ivesa na codvijantah
ksemaya bhutaya utatma-sukhaya casya
vikriditam bhagavato ruciravataraih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarve--all; hi--certainly; ami--these; vidhi-karah--executors of orders; tava--Your; sattva-dhamnah--being
always situated in the transcendental world; brahma-adayah--the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma;
vayam--we; iva--like; isa--O my Lord; na--not; ca--and; udvijantah--who are afraid (of Your fearful
appearance); ksemaya--for the protection; bhutaye--for the increase; uta--it is said; atma-sukhaya--for
personal satisfaction by such pastimes; ca--also; asya--of this (material world); vikriditam--manifested;
bhagavatah--of Your Lordship; rucira--very pleasing; avataraih--by Your incarnations.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, are sincere servants of Your Lordship, who are
situated in a transcendental position. Therefore they are not like us [Prahlada and his father, the demon
Hiranyakasipu]. Your appearance in this fearsome form is Your pastime for Your own pleasure. Such an
incarnation is always meant for the protection and improvement of the universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja wanted to assert that his father and the other members of his family were all
unfortunate because they were demoniac, whereas the devotees of the Lord are always fortunate because
they are always ready to follow the orders of the Lord. When the Supreme Lord appears in this material
world in His various incarnations, He performs two functions--saving the devotee and vanquishing the
demon (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam). Lord Nrsimhadeva, for example, appeared for the
protection of His devotee. Such pastimes as those of Nrsimhadeva are certainly not meant to create a
fearful situation for the devotees, but nonetheless the devotees, being very simple and faithful, were afraid
of the fierce incarnation of the Lord. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja, in the following prayer, requests the
Lord to give up His anger.
