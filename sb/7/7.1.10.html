<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead creates different types of bodies, offering a particular body
to each living entity according to his character and fruitive actions, the Lord revives all the qualities of
material nature--sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna. Then, as the Supersoul, He enters each body and
influences the qualities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, using sattva-guna for maintenance,
rajo-guna for creation and tamo-guna for annihilation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although material nature is conducted by the three qualities--sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna--
nature is not independent. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.10):
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and
unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again." The different
changes in the material world take place as actions and reactions of the three gunas, but above the three
gunas is their director, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the various types of bodies given to the
living entities by material nature (yantrarudhani mayaya), either sattva-guna, rajo-guna or tamo-guna is
prominent. The body is produced by material nature according to the direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Therefore it is said here, yada sisrksuh pura atmanah parah, indicating that the
body is certainly created by the Lord. Karmana daiva-netrena: according to the karma of the living entity,
a body is prepared under the Supreme Lord's supervision. Whether the body is of sattva-guna, rajo-guna
or tamo-guna, everything is done by the direction of the Supreme Lord through the agency of the external
energy (prthak sva-mayaya). In this way, in different types of bodies, the Lord (isvara) gives directions as
Paramatma, and again, to destroy the body, He employs the tamo-guna. This is the way the living entities
receive different types of bodies.
