vidvan apittham danujah kutumbam
pusnan sva-lokaya na kalpate vai
yah sviya-parakya-vibhinna-bhavas
tamah prapadyeta yatha vimudhah
SYNONYMS
vidvan--knowing (the inconvenience of material existence, especially in household life); api--although;
ittham--thus; danu-jah--O sons of demons; kutumbam--the family members or extended family members
(like one's community, society, nation or union of nations); pusnan--providing with all the necessities of
life; sva-lokaya--in understanding himself; na--not; kalpate--capable; vai--indeed; yah--he who; sviya--my
own; parakya--belonging to others; vibhinna--separate; bhavah--having a conception of life; tamah--
nothing but darkness; prapadyeta--enters; yatha--just as; vimudhah--a person without education, or one
who is like an animal.
TRANSLATION
O my friends, sons of demons! In this material world, even those who are apparently advanced in
education have the propensity to consider, "This is mine, and that is for others." Thus they are always
engaged in providing the necessities of life to their families in a limited conception of family life, just like
uneducated cats and dogs. They are unable to take to spiritual knowledge; instead, they are bewildered
and overcome by ignorance.
PURPORT
In human society there are attempts to educate the human being, but for animal society there is no such
system, nor are animals able to be educated. Therefore animals and unintelligent men are called vimudha,
or ignorant, bewildered, whereas an educated person is called vidvan. The real vidvan is one who tries to
understand his own position within this material world. For example, when Sanatana Gosvami submitted
to the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, his first question was 'ke ami', 'kene amaya jare tapa-traya'.
In other words, he wanted to know his constitutional position and why he was suffering from the
threefold miseries of material existence. This is the process of education. If one does not ask, "Who am I?
What is the goal of my life?" but instead follows the same animal propensities as cats and dogs, what is
the use of his education? As discussed in the previous verse, a living being is entrapped by his fruitive
activities, exactly like a silkworm trapped in its own cocoon. Foolish persons are generally encaged by
their fruitive actions (karma) because of a strong desire to enjoy this material world. Such attracted
persons become involved in society, community and nation and waste their time, not having profited
from having obtained human forms. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, great leaders, politicians,
philosophers and scientists are all engaged in foolish activities, thinking, "This is mine, and this is yours."
The scientists invent nuclear weapons and collaborate with the big leaders to protect the interests of their
own nation or society. In this verse, however, it is clearly stated that despite their so-called advanced
knowledge, they actually have the same mentality as cats and dogs. As cats, dogs and other animals, not
knowing their true interest in life, become increasingly involved in ignorance, the so-called educated
person who does not know his own self-interest or the true goal of life becomes increasingly involved in
materialism. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja advises everyone to follow the principles of varnasramadharma.
Specifically, at a certain point one must give up family life and take to the renounced order of life
to cultivate spiritual knowledge and thus become liberated. This is further discussed in the following
verses.

O my friends, sons of the demons; daityesu--among the demons; sangam--association; visaya-atma-kesu--
who are too addicted to sense enjoyment; upeta--one should approach; narayanam--Lord Narayana, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; adi-devam--the origin of all the demigods; sah--He; mukta-sangaih--by
the association of liberated persons; isitah--desired; apavargah--the path of liberation.
TRANSLATION
My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any
country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually
addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the
hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are
very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of
demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of Narayana is liberation from
the bondage of material existence.
PURPORT
Prahlada Maharaja has maintained the philosophical point of view that one should give up the dark well
of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
(hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta). In this verse also, he stresses the
same point. In the history of human society, no one, at any time or any place, has been liberated because
of too much affection and attachment for his family. Even in those who are apparently very educated, the
same family attachment is there. They cannot give up the association of their families, even in old age or
invalidity, for they are attached to sense enjoyment. As we have several times discussed, yan maithunadigrhamedhi-
sukham hi tuccham: so-called householders are simply attracted by sexual enjoyment. Thus
they keep themselves shackled in family life, and furthermore they want their children to be shackled in
the same way. Playing the parts of playboys in the hands of women, they glide down to the darkest
regions of material existence. Adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram punah punas carvita-carvananam. Because
they are unable to control their senses, they continue a life of chewing the chewed and therefore descend
to the darkest material regions. One should give up the association of such demons and adhere to the
association of devotees. Thus one will be able to be liberated from material bondage.
