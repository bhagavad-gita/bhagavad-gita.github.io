<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tat tu kalasya dirghatvat
stritvan matus tirodadhe
rsinanugrhitam mam
nadhunapy ajahat smrtih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--that (instruction on religion and knowledge); tu--indeed; kalasya--of time; dirghatvat--because of
the longness; stritvat--because of being a woman; matuh--of my mother; tirodadhe--disappeared; rsina--by
the sage; anugrhitam--being blessed; mam--me; na--not; adhuna--today; api--even; ajahat--left; smrtih--the
memory (of Narada Muni's instructions).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of the long duration of time that has passed and because of her being a woman and therefore
less intelligent, my mother has forgotten all those instructions; but the great sage Narada blessed me, and
therefore I could not forget them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (9.32) the Lord says:
mam hi partha vyapasritya
ye 'pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sudras
te 'pi yanti param gatim
"O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me--though they be lowborn, women, vaisyas [merchants] or
sudras [workers]--can approach the supreme destination." The word papa-yoni refers to those who are
less than sudras, but even though a woman may not be papa-yoni, because of being less intelligent she
sometimes forgets devotional instructions. For those who are strong enough, however, there is no
question of forgetting. Women are generally attached to material enjoyment, and because of this tendency
they sometimes forget devotional instructions. But if even a woman practices devotional service strictly,
according to the rules and regulations, the statement by the Lord Himself that she can return to Godhead
(te 'pi yanti param gatim) is not at all astonishing. One must take shelter of the Lord and rigidly follow
the rules and regulations. Then, regardless of what one is, one will return home, back to Godhead.
Prahlada Maharaja's mother was more concerned with protecting the child in the womb and was very
anxious to see her husband return. Therefore she could not consider very seriously the sublime
instructions of Narada Muni.
