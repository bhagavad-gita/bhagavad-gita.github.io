<h2>Text</h2>
bhrtya-laksana-jijnasur
bhaktam kamesv acodayat
bhavan samsara-bijesu
hrdaya-granthisu prabho
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhrtya-laksana-jijnasuh--desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee; bhaktam--the devotee;
kamesu--in the material world, where lusty desires predominate; acodayat--has sent; bhavan--Your
Lordship; samsara-bijesu--the root cause of being present in this material world; hrdaya-granthisu--which
(desire for material enjoyment) is in the cores of the hearts of all conditioned souls; prabho--O my
worshipable Lord.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my worshipable Lord, because the seed of lusty desires, which is the root cause of material existence,
is within the core of everyone's heart, You have sent me to this material world to exhibit the symptoms of
a pure devotee.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu has given considerable discussion about nitya-siddha and sadhana-siddha
devotees. Nitya-siddha devotees come from Vaikuntha to this material world to teach, by their personal
example, how to become a devotee. The living entities in this material world can take lessons from such
nitya-siddha devotees and thus become inclined to return home, back to Godhead. A nitya-siddha devotee
comes from Vaikuntha upon the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and shows by his example
how to become a pure devotee (anyabhilasita-sunyam). In spite of coming to this material world, the
nitya-siddha devotee is never attracted by the allurements of material enjoyment. A perfect example is
Prahlada Maharaja, who was a nitya-siddha, a maha-bhagavata devotee. Although Prahlada was born in
the family of Hiranyakasipu, an atheist, he was never attached to any kind of materialistic enjoyment.
Desiring to exhibit the symptoms of a pure devotee, the Lord tried to induce Prahlada Maharaja to take
material benedictions, but Prahlada Maharaja did not accept them. On the contrary, by his personal
example he showed the symptoms of a pure devotee. In other words, the Lord Himself has no desire to
send His pure devotee to this material world, nor does a devotee have any material purpose in coming.
When the Lord Himself appears as an incarnation within this material world, He is not allured by the
material atmosphere, and He has nothing to do with material activity, yet by His example He teaches the
common man how to become a devotee. Similarly, a devotee who comes here in accordance with the
order of the Supreme Lord shows by his personal behavior how to become a pure devotee. A pure
devotee, therefore, is a practical example for all living entities, including Lord Brahma.
