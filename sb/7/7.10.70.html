<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam vidhani--in this way; asya--of Krsna; hareh--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sva-mayaya--
by His transcendental potencies; vidambamanasya--acting like an ordinary human being; nr-lokam--
within human society; atmanah--of Him; viryani--transcendental activities; gitani--narrations; rsibhih--by
great saintly persons; jagat-guroh--of the supreme master; lokam--all the planetary systems; punanani--
purifying; aparam--what else; vadami kim--can I say.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, Sri Krsna, appeared as a human being, yet He performed many uncommon and wonderful
pastimes by His own potency. How can I say more about His activities than what has already been said by
great saintly persons? Everyone can be purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the
right source.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhagavad-gita and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Krsna, appears in human society as an ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the wellbeing
of the entire world. One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord Krsna to be
an ordinary human being. Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that
Krsna is everything (vasudevah samam iti). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if one studies the
entire Bhagavad-gita as it is, Krsna is very easy to understand. The Krsna consciousness movement is just
trying to make Krsna known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (krsnas tu
bhagavan svayam). If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Prahlada, the Best Among Exalted Devotees."
Chapter Eleven
The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes
This chapter describes the general principles by following which a human being, and specifically one
who is interested in advancing in spiritual life, can become perfect.
By hearing about the characteristics of Prahlada Maharaja, Maharaja Yudhisthira became extremely
pleased. Now he inquired from Narada Muni about the actual religion of a human being and about special
characteristics of varnasrama-dharma, which marks the highest status of human civilization. When
Maharaja Yudhisthira asked Narada Muni about these matters, Narada Muni stopped giving his own
statements and quoted statements by Lord Narayana, for He is the supreme authority for giving religious
codes (dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam). Every human being is expected to acquire thirty qualities,
such as truthfulness, mercy and austerity. The process of following the principles of religion is known as
sanatana-dharma, the eternal religious system.
The varnasrama system delineates the divisions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. It also sets
forth the system of samskaras. The garbhadhana samskara, the ceremony for begetting a child, must be
observed by the higher section of people, namely the dvijas. One who follows the garbhadhana samskara
system is actually twice-born, but those who do not, who deviate from the principles of varnasramadharma,
are called dvija-bandhus. The principal occupations for a brahmana are worshiping the Deity,
teaching others how to worship the Deity, studying the Vedic literatures, teaching the Vedic literatures,
accepting charity from others and again giving charity to others. A brahmana should make his livelihood
from these six occupational duties. The duty of a ksatriya is to give protection to the citizens and levy
taxes upon them, but he is forbidden to tax the brahmanas. The members of the Krsna consciousness
movement should therefore be exempt from government taxation. Ksatriyas may tax everyone but the
brahmanas. Vaisyas should cultivate the land, produce food grains and protect the cows, whereas the
sudras, who by quality never become brahmanas, ksatriyas or vaisyas, should serve the three higher
classes and be satisfied. Other means of livelihood are also prescribed for the brahmanas, and these are
four--salina, yayavara, sila, and unchana. Each of these occupational duties is successively better.
One who is in a lower grade of social life cannot accept the profession of a higher class unless necessary.
In times of emergency, all the classes but the ksatriyas may accept professional duties of others. The
means of livelihood known as rta (silonchana), amrta (ayacita), mrta (yacna), pramrta (karsana), and
satyanrta (vanijya) may be accepted by everyone but the ksatriyas. For a brahmana or a ksatriya, engaging
in the service of the vaisyas or sudras is considered the profession of dogs.
Narada Muni also described that the symptom of a brahmana is controlled senses, the symptoms of a
ksatriya are power and fame, the symptom of a vaisya is service to the brahmanas and ksatriyas, and the
symptom of a sudra is service to the three higher classes. The qualification for a woman is to be a very
faithful and chaste wife. In this way, Narada Muni described the characteristics of higher and lower grades
of people and recommended that one follow the principles of his caste or his hereditary occupation. One
cannot suddenly give up a profession to which he is accustomed, and therefore it is recommended that
one gradually be awakened. The symptoms of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras are very
important, and therefore one should be designated only by these symptoms, and not by birth. Designation
by birth is strictly forbidden by Narada Muni and all great personalities.
