<h2>Translation</h2>
O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire,
please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After being created from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, Lord Brahma, the original created living
being within the universe, created many other different types of living entities to reside in this universe.
Therefore, from the beginning of creation, the living entities were born of a superior living entity.
Ultimately, Krsna is the supreme living being, the father of all others. Aham bija-pradah pita: He is the
seed-giving father of all living entities.
Thus far, Hiranyakasipu has adored Lord Brahma as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and has
expected to become immortal by the benediction of Lord Brahma. Now, however, having come to
understand that even Lord Brahma is not immortal because at the end of the millennium Lord Brahma
will also die, Hiranyakasipu is very carefully asking him for benedictions that will be almost as good as
immortality. His first proposal is that he not be killed by any of the different forms of living entities
created by Lord Brahma within this material world.
