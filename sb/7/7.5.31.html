<h2>Text</h2>
na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum
durasaya ye bahir-artha-maninah
andha yathandhair upaniyamanas
te 'pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; te--they; viduh--know; sva-artha-gatim--the ultimate goal of life, or their own real interest; hi--
indeed; visnum--Lord Visnu and His abode; durasayah--being ambitious to enjoy this material world; ye--
who; bahih--external sense objects; artha-maninah--considering as valuable; andhah--persons who are
blind; yatha--just as; andhaih--by other blind men; upaniyamanah--being led; te--they; api--although; isatantryam--
to the ropes (laws) of material nature; uru--having very strong; damni--cords; baddhah--bound.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who are strongly entrapped by the consciousness of enjoying material life, and who have
therefore accepted as their leader or guru a similar blind man attached to external sense objects, cannot
understand that the goal of life is to return home, back to Godhead, and engage in the service of Lord
Visnu. As blind men guided by another blind man miss the right path and fall into a ditch, materially
attached men led by another materially attached man are bound by the ropes of fruitive labor, which are
made of very strong cords, and they continue again and again in materialistic life, suffering the threefold
miseries.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since there must always be a difference of opinion between demons and devotees, Hiranyakasipu, when
criticized by his son Prahlada Maharaja, should not have been surprised that Prahlada Maharaja differed
from his way of life. Nonetheless, Hiranyakasipu was extremely angry and wanted to rebuke his son for
deriding his teacher or spiritual master, who had been born in the brahmana family of the great acarya
Sukracarya. The word sukra means "semen," and acarya refers to a teacher or guru. Hereditary gurus, or
spiritual masters, have been accepted everywhere since time immemorial, but Prahlada Maharaja declined
to accept such a seminal guru or take instruction from him. An actual guru is srotriya, one who has heard
or received perfect knowledge through parampara, the disciplic succession. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja
did not recognize a seminal spiritual master. Such spiritual masters are not at all interested in Visnu.
Indeed, they are hopeful of material success (bahir-artha-maninah). The word bahih means "external,"
artha means "interest," and manina means "taking very seriously." Generally speaking, practically
everyone is unaware of the spiritual world. The knowledge of the materialists is restricted within the fourbillion-
mile limit of this material world, which is in the dark portion of the creation; they do not know
that beyond the material world is the spiritual world. Unless one is a devotee of the Lord, one cannot
understand the existence of the spiritual world. Gurus, teachers, who are simply interested in this
material world are described in this verse as andha, blind. Such blind men may lead many other blind
followers without true knowledge of material conditions, but they are not accepted by devotees like
Prahlada Maharaja. Such blind teachers, being interested in the external, material world, are always bound
by the strong ropes of material nature.
