<h2>Text</h2>
etavan eva loke 'smin
pumsah svarthah parah smrtah
ekanta-bhaktir govinde
yat sarvatra tad-iksanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etavan--this much; eva--certainly; loke asmin--in this material world; pumsah--of the living entity; svaarthah--
the real self-interest; parah--transcendental; smrtah--regarded; ekanta-bhaktih--unalloyed
devotional service; govinde--to Govinda; yat--which; sarvatra--everywhere; tat-iksanam--seeing the
relationship with Govinda, Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this material world, to render service to the lotus feet of Govinda, the cause of all causes, and to see
Him everywhere, is the only goal of life. This much alone is the ultimate goal of human life, as explained
by all the revealed scriptures.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words sarvatra tad-iksanam describe the highest perfection of devotional service, in
which one sees everything with reference to Govinda's activities. The highly elevated devotee never sees
anything unrelated to Govinda.
sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara murti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphurti
"The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he
does not exactly see their forms. Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the
Supreme Lord." (Cc. Madhya 8.274) Even in this material world, a devotee does not see materially
manifested things; instead he sees Govinda in everything. When he sees a tree or a human being, a
devotee sees them in relation to Govinda. Govindam adi-purusam: Govinda is the original source of
everything.
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.
He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." (Brahma-samhita
5.1) The test of a perfect devotee is that he sees Govinda everywhere in this universe, even in every atomic
particle (anda-ntara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham). This is the perfect vision of a devotee. It is
therefore said:
narayanam ayam dhirah
pasyanti paramarthinah
jagad dhananmayam lubdhah
kamukah kaminimayam
A devotee sees everyone and everything in relationship with Narayana (narayanam ayam). Everything is
an expansion of Narayana's energy. Just as those who are greedy see everything as a source of moneymaking
and those who are lusty see everything as being conducive to sex, the most perfect devotee,
Prahlada Maharaja, saw Narayana even within a stone column. This does not mean, however, that we
must accept the words daridra-narayana, which have been manufactured by some unscrupulous person.
One who actually envisions Narayana everywhere makes no distinction between the poor and the rich. To
single out the daridra-narayanas, or poor Narayana, and reject the dhani-narayana, or rich Narayana, is
not the vision of a devotee. Rather, that is the imperfect vision of materialistic persons.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "What Prahlada Learned in the Womb."
Chapter Eight
Lord Nrsimhadeva Slays the King of the Demons
As described in this chapter, Hiranyakasipu was ready to kill his own son Prahlada Maharaja, but the
Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared in front of the demon as Sri Nrkesari, half lion and half man,
and killed him.
Following the instructions of Prahlada Maharaja, all the sons of the demons became attached to Lord
Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When this attachment became pronounced, their teachers,
Sanda and Amarka, were very much afraid that the boys would become more and more devoted to the
Lord. In a helpless condition, they approached Hiranyakasipu and described in detail the effect of
Prahlada's preaching. After hearing of this, Hiranyakasipu decided to kill his son Prahlada. Hiranyakasipu
was so angry that Prahlada Maharaja fell down at his feet and said many things just to pacify him, but he
was unsuccessful in satisfying his demoniac father. Hiranyakasipu, as a typical demon, began to advertise
himself as being greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Prahlada Maharaja challenged him,
saying that Hiranyakasipu was not God, and began to glorify the Supreme personality of Godhead,
declaring that the Lord is all-pervading, that everything is under Him, and that no one is equal to or
greater than Him. Thus he requested his father to be submissive to the omnipotent Supreme Lord.
The more Prahlada Maharaja glorified the Supreme personality of Godhead, the more angry and agitated
the demon became. Hiranyakasipu asked his Vaisnava son whether his God existed within the columns of
the palace, and Prahlada Maharaja immediately accepted that since the Lord is present everywhere, He
was also present within the columns. When Hiranyakasipu heard this philosophy from his young son, he
derided the boy's statement as just the talk of a child and forcefully struck the pillar with his fist.
As soon as Hiranyakasipu struck the column, there issued forth a tumultuous sound. At first
Hiranyakasipu, the King of the demons, could not see anything but the pillar, but to substantiate
Prahlada's statements, the Lord came out of the pillar in His wonderful incarnation as Narasimha, half
lion and half man. Hiranyakasipu could immediately understand that the extraordinarily wonderful form
of the Lord was surely meant for his death, and thus he prepared to fight with the form of half lion and
half man. The Lord performed His pastimes by fighting with the demon for some time, and in the evening,
on the border between day and night, the Lord captured the demon, threw him on His lap, and killed him
by piercing his abdomen with His nails. The Lord not only killed Hiranyakasipu, the King of the demons,
but also killed many of his followers. When there was no one else to fight, the Lord, roaring with anger,
sat down on Hiranyakasipu's throne.
The entire universe was thus relieved of the rule of Hiranyakasipu, and everyone was jubilant in
transcendental bliss. Then all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, approached the Lord. These
included the great saintly persons, the Pitas, the Siddhas, the Vidyadharas, the Nagas, the Manus, the
prajapatis, the Gandharvas, the Caranas, the Yaksas, the Kimpurusas, the Vaitalikas, the Kinnaras and also
many other varieties of beings in human form. All of them stood not far from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and began offering their prayers unto the Lord, whose spiritual effulgence was brilliant as He sat
on the throne.
