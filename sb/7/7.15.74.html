<h2>Text</h2>
dharmas te grha-medhiyo
varnitah papa-nasanah
grhastho yena padavim
anjasa nyasinam iyat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharmah--that religious process; te--to you; grha-medhiyah--although attached to household life;
varnitah--explained (by me); papa-nasanah--the destruction of sinful reactions; grhasthah--a person in
household life; yena--by which; padavim--the position; anjasa--very easily; nyasinam--of those in the
renounced order of life; iyat--can obtain.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The process of chanting the holy name of the Lord is so powerful that by this chanting even
householders [grhasthas] can very easily gain the ultimate result achieved by persons in the renounced
order. Maharaja Yudhisthira, I have now explained to you that process of religion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is a confirmation of the Krsna consciousness movement. Anyone who takes part in this movement,
regardless of what he is, can gain the topmost result achieved by a perfect sannyasi, namely brahma jnana
(spiritual knowledge). Even more important, he can advance in devotional service. Maharaja Yudhisthira
thought that because he was a grhastha there was no hope of his being liberated, and therefore he asked
Narada Muni how he could get out of material entanglement. But Narada Muni, citing a practical example
from his own life, established that by associating with devotees and chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, any
man in any condition of life can achieve the highest perfection without a doubt.
