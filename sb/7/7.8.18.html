janmadyah sad ime bhava
drsta dehasya natmanah
phalanam iva vrksasya
kalenesvara-murtina
SYNONYMS
janma-adyah--beginning with birth; sat--the six (birth, existence, growth, transformation, dwindling
and at last death); ime--all these; bhavah--different conditions of the body; drstah--seen; dehasya--of the
body; na--not; atmanah--of the soul; phalanam--of the fruits; iva--like; vrksasya--of a tree; kalena--in due
course of time; isvara-murtina--whose form is the ability to transform or control the bodily activities.
TRANSLATION
Just as the fruits and flowers of a tree in due course of time undergo six changes--birth, existence,
growth, transformation, dwindling and then death--the material body, which is obtained by the spirit soul
under different circumstances, undergoes similar changes. However, there are no such changes for the
spirit soul.
PURPORT
This is a very important verse in understanding the difference between the spiritual soul and the
material body. The soul is eternal, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.20):
na jayate mriyate va kadacin
nayam bhutva bhavita va na bhuyah
ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano
na hanyate hanyamane sarire
"For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is
unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain." The spirit
soul is eternal, being freed from waste and change, which take place because of the material body. The
example of a tree and its fruits and flowers is very simple and clear. A tree stands for many, many years,
but with the seasonal changes its fruits and flowers undergo six transformations. The foolish theory of
modern chemists that life can be produced by chemical interactions cannot be accepted as truth. The birth
of a human being's material body takes place due to a mixture of the ovum and semen, but the history of
birth is that although the ovum and semen mix together after sex, there is not always pregnancy. Unless
the soul enters the mixture, there is no possibility of pregnancy, but when the soul takes shelter of the
mixture the body takes birth, exists, grows, transforms and dwindles, and ultimately it is vanquished. The
fruits and flowers of a tree seasonally come and go, but the tree continues to stand. Similarly, the
transmigrating soul accepts various bodies, which undergo six transformations, but the soul remains
permanently the same (ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano na hanyate hanyamane sarire). The soul is eternal
and ever existing, but the bodies accepted by the soul are changing.
There are two kinds of soul--the Supreme Soul (the Personality of Godhead) and the individual soul
(the living entity). As various bodily changes take place in the individual soul, different millenniums of
creation take place in the Supreme Soul. In this regard, Madhvacarya says:
sad vikarah sarirasya
na visnos tad-gatasya
ca tad-adhinam sariram ca
jnatva tan mamatam tyajet
Since the body is the external feature of the soul, the soul is not dependent on the body; rather, the
body is dependent on the soul. One who understands this truth should not be very much anxious about
the maintenance of his body. There is no possibility of maintaining the body permanently or eternally.
Antavanta ime deha nityasyoktah saririnah. This is the statement of Bhagavad-gita (2.18). The material
body is antavat (perishable), but the soul within the body is eternal (nityasyoktah saririnah). Lord Visnu
and the individual souls, who are part and parcel of Him, are both eternal. Nityo nityanam cetanas
cetananam. Lord Visnu is the chief living being, whereas the individual living entities are parts of Lord
Visnu. All the various grades of bodies--from the gigantic universal body to the small body of an ant--are
perishable, but the Supersoul and the soul, being equal in quality, both exist eternally. This is further
explained in the next verses.

with the material body and then with one's wife, children, family, community, nation and so on; mohajam--
produced from illusory knowledge; tyajet--must give up.
TRANSLATION
"Atma" refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual, free from birth and
death, free from deterioration and free from material contamination. They are individual, they are the
knowers of the external body, and they are the foundation or shelter of everything. They are free from
material change, they are self-illuminated, they are the cause of all causes, and they are all-pervading.
They have nothing to do with the material body, and therefore they are always uncovered. With these
transcendental qualities, one who is actually learned must give up the illusory conception of life, in which
one thinks, "I am this material body, and everything in relationship with this body is mine."
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (15.7) Lord Krsna clearly says, mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah: "All the living
entities are part of Me." Therefore the living entities are qualitatively the same as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the leader, the Supreme among all the living entities. In the Vedas it is said, nityo
nityanam cetanas cetananam: the Lord is the chief individual living entity, the leader of the subordinate
living entities. Because the living entities are parts or samples of God, their qualities are not different from
those of the Supreme Lord. The living entities have the same qualities as the Lord, just as a drop of sea
water is composed of the same chemicals as the great sea itself. Thus there is oneness in quality but a
difference in quantity. One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by understanding the
sample, the living entity, because all the qualities of God exist in a minute quantity in the living entities.
There is oneness, but God is great whereas the living entities are extremely small. Anor aniyan mahato
mahiyan (Katha Upanisad 1.2.20). The living entities are smaller than the atom, but God is greater than
the greatest. Our conception of greatness may be represented by the sky because we think of the sky as
being unlimitedly big, but God is bigger than the sky. Similarly, we have knowledge that the living entities
are smaller than atoms, being one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair, yet the quality of being the
supreme cause of all causes exists in the living entity as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Indeed, it is due to the presence of the living entity that the body exists and bodily changes take place.
Similarly, it is because the Supreme Lord is within this universe that the changes dictated by the material
laws occur.
The word ekah, meaning "individual," is significant. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), mat-sthani
sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah. Everything, material and spiritual, including earth, water, air,
fire, sky and the living entities, exists on the platform of spirit soul. Although everything is an emanation
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that the Supreme Lord is dependent
upon anything else.
Both God and the living entity are fully conscious. As living entities, we are conscious of our bodily
existence. Similarly, the Lord is conscious of the gigantic cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed in the
Vedas. Yasmin dyauh prthivi cantariksam. Vijnataram adhikena vijaniyat. Ekam evadvitiyam. Atma-jyotih
samrad ihovaca. Sa iman lokan asrjata. Satyam jnanam anantam. Asango hy ayam purusah. purnasya
purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate. All these Vedic injunctions prove that both the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and the minute soul are individual. One is great, and the other is small, but both of them are
the cause of all causes--the corporally limited and the universally unlimited.
We should always remember that although we are equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
quality, we are never equal to Him in quantity. Persons with a small fund of intelligence, finding
themselves equal in quality with God, foolishly think that they are equal in quantity also. Their
intelligence is called avisuddha-buddhayah--unpolished or contaminated intelligence. When such
persons, after endeavoring hard for many, many lives to understand the supreme cause, are finally in
actual knowledge of Krsna, Vasudeva, they surrender unto Him (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma
sudurlabhah). Thus they become great mahatmas, perfect souls. If one is fortunate enough to understand
his relationship with God, knowing that God is great (vibhu) whereas the living entity is small (anu), he
is perfect in knowledge. The individual exists in darkness when he thinks that he is the material body and
that everything in relationship with the material body belongs to him. This is called aham mama (janasya
moho 'yam aham mameti). This is illusion. One must give up his illusory conception and thus become
fully aware of everything.
