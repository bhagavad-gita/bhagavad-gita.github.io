kunjara--elephants; kosa--treasury house; bhutayah--and other luxuries for sense gratification and
material enjoyment; sarve--all; artha--economic development; kamah--and sense gratification; ksanabhangura--

<h2>Translation</h2>
One's riches, beautiful wife and female friends, one's sons and daughters, one's residence, one's
domestic animals like cows, elephants and horses, one's treasury, economic development and sense
gratification--indeed, even the lifetime in which one can enjoy all these material opulences--are certainly
temporary and flickering. Since the opportunity of human life is temporary, what benefit can these
material opulences give to a sensible man who has understood himself to be eternal?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse describes how the advocates of economic development are frustrated by the laws of nature.
As the previous verse asks, kim visayopapadanaih: what is the actual benefit of so-called economic
development? The history of the world has factually proved that attempts to increase economic
development for bodily comfort through the advancement of material civilization have done nothing to
remedy the inevitability of birth, death, old age and disease. Everyone has knowledge of huge empires
throughout the history of the world--the Roman Empire, the Moghul Empire, the British Empire and so
on--but all the societies engaged in such economic development (sarve 'rtha-kamah) have been frustrated
by the laws of nature through periodic wars, pestilence, famine and so on. Thus all their attempts have
been flickering and temporary. In this verse, therefore, it is said, kurvanti martyasya kiyat priyam calah:
one may be very proud of possessing a vast empire, but such empires are impermanent; after one hundred
or two hundred years, everything is finished. All such positions of economic development, although
created with great endeavor and hardship, are vanquished very soon. Therefore they have been described
as calah. An intelligent man should conclude that material economic development is not at all pleasing.
The entire world is described in Bhagavad-gita as duhkhalayam asasvatam--miserable and temporary.
Economic development may be pleasing for some time, but it cannot endure. Thus many big businessmen
are now very morose because they are being harassed by various plundering governments. In conclusion,
why should one waste his time for so-called economic development, which is neither permanent nor
pleasing to the soul?
On the other hand, our relationship with Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is eternal. Nityasiddha
krsna-prema. The pure souls are eternally in love with Krsna, and this permanent love, either as a
servant, a friend, a parent or a conjugal lover, is not at all difficult to revive. Especially in this age, the
concession is that simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra (harer nama harer nama harer namaiva
kevalam) one revives his original relationship with God and thus becomes so happy that he does not want
anything material. As enunciated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, na dhanam na janam na sundarim kavitam
va jagad-isa kamaye. A very advanced devotee in Krsna consciousness does not want riches, followers or
possessions. Rayah kalatram pasavah sutadayo grha mahi kunjara-kosa-bhutayah. The satisfaction of
possessing material opulences, although perhaps of a different standard, is available even in the lives of
dogs and hogs, who cannot revive their eternal relationship with Krsna. In human life, however, our
eternal, dormant relationship with Krsna is possible to revive. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja has described
this life as arthadam. Consequently, instead of wasting our time for economic development, which cannot
give us any happiness, if we simply try to revive our eternal relationship with Krsna, we will properly
utilize our lives.
