<h2>Text</h2>
dharma-badho vidharmah syat
para-dharmo 'nya-coditah
upadharmas tu pakhando
dambho va sabda-bhic chalah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharma-badhah--obstructs the execution of one's own religious principles; vidharmah--against the
principles of religion; syat--should be; para-dharmah--imitating religious systems for which one is unfit;
anya-coditah--which is introduced by someone else; upadharmah--concocted religious principles; tu--
indeed; pakhandah--by one who is against the principles of Vedas, standard scriptures; dambhah--who is
falsely proud; va--or; sabda-bhit--by word jugglery; chalah--a cheating religious system.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Religious principles that obstruct one from following his own religion are called vidharma. Religious
principles introduced by others are called para-dharma. A new type of religion created by one who is
falsely proud and who opposes the principles of the Vedas is called upadharma. And interpretation by
one's jugglery of words is called chala-dharma.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To create a new type of dharma has become fashionable in this age. So-called svamis and yogis support
that one may follow any type of religious system, according to one's own choice, because all systems are
ultimately the same. In Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, such fashionable ideas are called vidharma because
they go against one's own religious system. The real religious system is described by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja. The real religious system is
that of surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord. In the Sixth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, in connection
with Ajamila's deliverance, Yamaraja says, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam: real religion is that
which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as real law is that which is given by the
government. No one can manufacture actual law at home, nor can one manufacture actual religion.
Elsewhere it is said, sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje: the real religious system is that
which leads one to become a devotee of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, anything opposed to this religious
system of progressive Krsna consciousness is called vidharma, para-dharma, upadharma or chala-dharma.
Misinterpretation of Bhagavad-gita is chala-dharma. When Krsna directly says something and some rascal
interprets it to mean something different, this is chala-dharma--a religious system of cheating--or sabdabhit,
a jugglery of words. One should be extremely careful to avoid these various types of cheating
systems of religion.
