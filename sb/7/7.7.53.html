<h2>Text</h2>
tato harau bhagavati
bhaktim kuruta danavah
atmaupamyena sarvatra
sarva-bhutatmanisvare
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--therefore; harau--unto Lord Hari; bhagavati--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhaktim--
devotional service; kuruta--execute; danavah--O my dear friends, O sons of demons; atma-aupamyena--
just as one's own self; sarvatra--everywhere; sarva-bhuta-atmani--who is situated as the soul and
Supersoul of all living entities; isvare--unto the Supreme Lord, the controller.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear friends, O sons of the demons, in the same favorable way that one sees himself and takes care
of himself, take to devotional service to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present
everywhere as the Supersoul of all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word atmaupamyena refers to thinking others to be like oneself. One can very intelligently
conclude that without devotional service, without becoming Krsna conscious, one cannot be happy.
Therefore the duty of all devotees is to preach Krsna consciousness everywhere all over the world,
because all living entities without Krsna consciousness are suffering the pangs of material existence. To
preach Krsna consciousness is the best welfare activity. Indeed, it is described by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu as para-upakara, work for the true benefit of others. The activities of para-upakara have been
especially entrusted to those who have taken birth in India as human beings.
bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara
janma sarthaka kari' kara para-upakara
(Cc. Adi 9.41)
The entire world is suffering for want of Krsna consciousness. Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
advised all human beings born in India to make their lives perfect by Krsna consciousness and then
preach the gospel of Krsna consciousness all over the world so that others may become happy by
executing the principles of Krsna consciousness.
