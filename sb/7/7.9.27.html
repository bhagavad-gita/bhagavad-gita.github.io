<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
naisa paravara-matir bhavato nanu syaj
jantor yathatma-suhrdo jagatas tathapi
samsevaya surataror iva te prasadah
sevanurupam udayo na paravaratvam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; esa--this; para-avara--of higher or lower; matih--such discrimination; bhavatah--of Your
Lordship; nanu--indeed; syat--there can be; jantoh--of ordinary living entities; yatha--as; atma-suhrdah--of
one who is the friend; jagatah--of the whole material world; tathapi--but still (there is such a
demonstration of intimacy or difference); samsevaya--according to the degree of service rendered by the
devotee; surataroh iva--like that of the desire tree in Vaikunthaloka (which offers fruits according to the
desire of the devotee); te--Your; prasadah--benediction or blessing; seva-anurupam--according to the
category of service one renders to the Lord; udayah--manifestation; na--not; para-avaratvam--
discrimination due to higher or lower levels.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Unlike an ordinary living entity, my Lord, You do not discriminate between friends and enemies, the
favorable and the unfavorable, because for You there is no conception of higher and lower. Nonetheless,
You offer Your benedictions according to the level of one's service, exactly as a desire tree delivers fruits
according to one's desires and makes no distinction between the lower and the higher.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord clearly says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham:
"As one surrenders to Me, I reward him accordingly." As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jivera
'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': every living being is an eternal servant of Krsna. According to the
service the living entity renders, he automatically receives benedictions from Krsna, who does not make
distinctions, thinking, "Here is a person in an intimate relationship with Me, and here is a person I
dislike." Krsna advises everyone to surrender to Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam
vraja). One's relationship with the Supreme Lord is in proportion to that surrender and the service one
renders unto the Lord. Thus throughout the entire world the higher or lower positions of the living
entities are selected by the living entities themselves. If one is inclined to dictate that the Lord grant
something, one receives benedictions according to his desires. If one wants to be elevated to the higher
planetary systems, the heavenly planets, he can be promoted to the place he desires, and if one wants to
remain a hog or a pig on earth, the Lord fulfills that desire also. Therefore, one's position is determined by
one's desires; the Lord is not responsible for the higher or lower grades of our existence. This is further
explained quite definitely in Bhagavad-gita (9.25) by the Lord Himself:
yanti deva-vrata devan
pitrn yanti pitr-vratah
bhutani yanti bhutejya
yanti mad-yajino 'pi mam
Some people want to be promoted to the heavenly planets, some want to be promoted to Pitrloka, and
some want to remain on earth, but if one is interested in returning home, back to Godhead, he can be
promoted there also. According to the demands of a particular devotee, he receives a result by the grace of
the Lord. The Lord does not discriminate, thinking, "Here is a person favorable to Me, and here is a
person who is not favorable." Rather, He fulfills the desires of everyone. Therefore the sastras enjoin:
akamah sarva-kamo va
moksa-kama udara-dhih
tivrena bhakti-yogena
yajeta purusam param
"Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results, or is
after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for
complete perfection, culminating in Krsna consciousness." (Bhag. 2.3.10) According to one's position,
whether as a devotee, a karmi or a jnani, whatever one wants one can get if one fully engages in the
service of the Lord.
