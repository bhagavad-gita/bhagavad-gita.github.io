<h2>Translation</h2>
O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence, for wherever I stay I am fully
absorbed in thoughts of Your glories and activities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are
making elaborate plans for material happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am
simply concerned with love for them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Throughout the entire world, everyone is making big, big plans to adjust the miseries of the material
world, and this is true at present, in the past and in the future. Nonetheless, although they make elaborate
political, social and cultural plans, they have all been described herein as vimudha--fools. The material
world has been described in Bhagavad-gita as duhkhalayam asasvatam--temporary and miserable--but
these fools are trying to turn the material world into sukhalayam, a place of happiness, not knowing how
everything acts by the arrangement of material nature, which works in her own way.

"The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to
be the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature." (Bg. 3.27)
There is a plan for material nature, personally known as Durga, to punish the demons. Although the
asuras, the godless demons, struggle for existence, they are directly attacked by the goddess Durga, who is
well equipped with ten hands with different types of weapons to punish them. She is carried by her lion
carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance. Everyone struggles very hard to fight through the modes
of passion and ignorance and conquer material nature, but at the end everyone is vanquished by nature's
laws.
There is a river known as Vaitarani between the material and spiritual worlds, and one must cross this
river to reach the other side, or the spiritual world. This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in
Bhagavad-gita (7.14), daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: "This divine energy of Mine,
consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome." The same word duratyaya,
meaning "very difficult," is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature
except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans,
they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as
vimudha--first-class fools. As for Prahlada Maharaja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the
material world, he was full of Krsna consciousness. Those who are Krsna conscious, trying to serve the
Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in Krsna consciousness and is struggling for
existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahlada Maharaja was happy and unhappy
simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being Krsna conscious, yet he
felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material
world.
