TRANSLATION
The voice of the Lord vibrated as follows: O best of learned persons, do not fear! I wish all good fortune
to you. Become My devotees by hearing and chanting about Me and offering Me prayers, for these are
certainly meant to award benedictions to all living entities. I know all about the activities of
Hiranyakasipu and shall surely stop them very soon. Please wait patiently until that time.
PURPORT
Sometimes people are very much eager to see God. In considering the word mad-darsanam, "seeing
Me," which is mentioned in this verse, one should note that in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, bhaktya mam
abhijanati. In other words, the ability to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead or to see Him or
talk with Him depends on one's advancement in devotional service, which is called bhakti. In bhakti there
are nine different activities: sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam. arcanam vandanam
dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam. Because all these devotional activities are absolute, there is no
fundamental difference between worshiping the Deity in the temple, seeing Him and chanting His glories.
Indeed, all of these are ways of seeing Him, for everything done in devotional service is a means of direct
contact with the Lord. The vibration of the Lord's voice appeared in the presence of all the devotees, and
although the person vibrating the sound was unseen to them, they were meeting or seeing the Lord
because they were offering prayers and because the vibration of the Lord was present. Contrary to the
laws of the material world, there is no difference between seeing the Lord, offering prayers and hearing
the transcendental vibration. Pure devotees, therefore, are fully satisfied by glorifying the Lord. Such
glorification is called kirtana. Performing kirtana and hearing the vibration of the sound Hare Krsna is
actually seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. One must realize this position, and then one
will be able to understand the absolute nature of the Lord's activities.
