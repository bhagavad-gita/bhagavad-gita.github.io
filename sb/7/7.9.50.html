<h2>Text</h2>
tat te 'rhattama namah stuti-karma-pujah
karma smrtis caranayoh sravanam kathayam
samsevaya tvayi vineti sad-angaya kim
bhaktim janah paramahamsa-gatau labheta
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; te--unto You; arhat-tama--O supreme of all worshipable persons; namah--respectful
obeisances; stuti-karma-pujah--worshiping Your Lordship by offering prayers and other devotional
activities; karma--activities being dedicated to You; smrtih--constant remembrance; caranayoh--of Your
lotus feet; sravanam--always hearing; kathayam--in topics (about You); samsevaya--such devotional
service; tvayi--unto You; vina--without; iti--thus; sat-angaya--having six different parts; kim--how;
bhaktim--devotional service; janah--a person; paramahamsa-gatau--obtainable by the paramahamsa;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all persons to whom prayers are offered, I
offer my respectful obeisances unto You because without rendering six kinds of devotional service unto
You--offering prayers, dedicating all the results of activities, worshiping You, working on Your behalf,
always remembering Your lotus feet and hearing about Your glories--who can achieve that which is meant
for the paramahamsas?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedas enjoin: nayam atma pravacanena labhyo na medhaya na bahuna srutena. One cannot
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead simply by studying the Vedas and offering prayers. Only
by the grace of the Supreme Lord can one understand Him. The process of understanding the Lord,
therefore, is bhakti. Without bhakti, simply following the Vedic injunctions to understand the Absolute
Truth will not be helpful at all. The process of bhakti is understood by the paramahamsa, one who has
accepted the essence of everything. The results of bhakti are reserved for such a paramahamsa, and this
stage cannot be obtained by any Vedic process other than devotional service. Other processes, such as
jnana and yoga, can be successful only when mixed with bhakti. When we speak of jnana-yoga, karmayoga
and dhyana-yoga the word yoga indicates bhakti. Bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, executed with
intelligence and full knowledge, is the only successful method for going back home, back to Godhead. If
one wants to be liberated from the pangs of material existence, he should take to devotional service for
quick attainment of this goal.
