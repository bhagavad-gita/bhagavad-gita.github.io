<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord Brahma, your position within this universe is certainly most auspicious for everyone, especially
the cows and brahmanas. Brahminical culture and the protection of cows can be increasingly glorified,
and thus all kinds of material happiness, opulence and good fortune will automatically increase. But
unfortunately, if Hiranyakasipu occupies your seat, everything will be lost.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words dvija-gavam paramesthyam indicate the most exalted position of the brahmanas,
brahminical culture and the cows. In Vedic culture, the welfare of the cows and the welfare of the
brahmanas are essential. Without a proper arrangement for developing brahminical culture and protecting
cows, all the affairs of administration will go to hell. Being afraid that Hiranyakasipu would occupy the
post of Brahma, all the demigods were extremely disturbed. Hiranyakasipu was a well-known demon, and
the demigods knew that if demons and Raksasas were to occupy the supreme post, brahminical culture
and protection of cows would come to an end. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), the original proprietor of
everything is Lord Krsna (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram). The Lord, therefore, knows
particularly well how to develop the material condition of the living entities within this material world. In
every universe there is one Brahma engaged on behalf of Lord Krsna, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(tene brahma hrdaya adi-kavaye). The principal creator in each brahmanda is Lord Brahma, who imparts
Vedic knowledge to his disciples and sons. On every planet, the king or supreme controller must be a
representative of Brahma. Therefore, if a Raksasa, or demon, were situated in Brahma's post, then the
entire arrangement of the universe, especially the protection of the brahminical culture and cows, would
be ruined. All the demigods anticipated this danger, and therefore they went to request Lord Brahma to
take immediate steps to thwart Hiranyakasipu's plan.
In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma was attacked by two demons--Madhu and Kaitabha--but
Krsna saved him. Therefore Krsna is addressed as madhu-kaitabha-hantr. Now again, Hiranyakasipu was
trying to replace Brahma. The material world is so situated that even the position of Lord Brahma, not to
speak of ordinary living entities, is sometimes in danger. Nonetheless, until the time of Hiranyakasipu, no
one had tried to replace Lord Brahma. Hiranyakasipu, however, was such a great demon that he
maintained this ambition.
The word bhutyai means "for increasing opulence," and the word sreyase refers to ultimately returning
home, back to Godhead. In spiritual advancement, one's material position improves at the same time that
the path of liberation becomes clear and one is freed from material bondage. If one is situated in an
opulent position in spiritual advancement, his opulence never decreases. Therefore such a spiritual
benediction is called bhuti or vibhuti. Krsna confirms this in Bhagavad-gita (10.41). Yad yad vibhutimat
sattvam. .. mama tejo-'msa-sambhavam: if a devotee advances in spiritual consciousness and thus becomes
materially opulent also, his position is a special gift from the Lord. Such opulence is never to be
considered material. At the present, especially on this planet earth, the influence of Lord Brahma has
decreased considerably, and the representatives of Hiranyakasipu--the Raksasas and demons--have taken
charge. Therefore there is no protection of brahminical culture and cows, which are the basic
prerequisites for all kinds of good fortune. This age is very dangerous because society is being managed by
demons and Raksasas.
