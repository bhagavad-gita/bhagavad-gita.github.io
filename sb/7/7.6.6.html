<h2>Text</h2>
pumso varsa-satam hy ayus
tad-ardham cajitatmanah
nisphalam yad asau ratryam
sete 'ndham prapitas tamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pumsah--of every human being; varsa-satam--one hundred years; hi--indeed; ayuh--duration of life; tat--
of that; ardham--half; ca--and; ajita-atmanah--of a person who is a servant of his senses; nisphalam--
without profit, without meaning; yat--because; asau--that person; ratryam--at night; sete--sleeps;
andham--ignorance (forgetting his body and soul); prapitah--being completely possessed of; tamah--
darkness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Every human being has a maximum duration of life of one hundred years, but for one who cannot
control his senses, half of those years are completely lost because at night he sleeps twelve hours, being
covered by ignorance. Therefore such a person has a lifetime of only fifty years.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma, a human being and an ant all live for one hundred years, but their lifetimes of one
hundred years are different from one another. This world is a relative world, and its relative moments of
time are different. Thus the one hundred years of Brahma are not the same as the one hundred years of a
human being. From Bhagavad-gita we times 1,000 years (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano
viduh). Thus the varsa-satam, or one hundred years, are relatively different according to time, person and
circumstances. As far as human beings are concerned, the calculation given here is right for the general
public. Although one has a maximum of one hundred years of life, by sleeping one loses fifty years.
Eating, sleeping, sex life and fear are the four bodily necessities, but to utilize the full duration of life a
person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must reduce these activities. That will give him an
opportunity to fully use his lifetime.
