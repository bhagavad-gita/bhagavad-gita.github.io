<h2>Translation</h2>
O great one, O Supreme Lord, because of combination with pleasing and displeasing circumstances and
because of separation from them, one is placed in a most regrettable position, within heavenly or hellish
planets, as if burning in a fire of lamentation. Although there are many remedies by which to get out of
miserable life, any such remedies in the material world are more miserable than the miseries themselves.
Therefore I think that the only remedy is to engage in Your service. Kindly instruct me in such service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja aspired to engage in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. After the death of his
father, who was materially very opulent, Prahlada would have inherited his father's property, which
extended throughout the world, but Prahlada Maharaja was not inclined to accept such material opulence,
for whether one is in the heavenly or hellish planets or is a rich or a poor man's son, material conditions
are everywhere. Therefore no condition of life is at all pleasing. If one wants the uncontaminated pleasure
of blissful life, he must engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Material opulence
may be somewhat pleasing for the time being, but to come to that temporary pleasing condition one must
work extremely hard. When a poor man is rich he may be better situated, but to come to that position he
had to accept many miseries. The fact is that in material life, whether one is miserable or happy, both
conditions are miserable. If one actually wants happy, blissful life, one must become Krsna conscious and
constantly engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the real remedy. The entire
world is under the illusion that people will be happy by advancing in materialistic measures to counteract
the miseries of conditional life, but this attempt will never be successful. Humanity must be trained to
engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That is the purpose of the Krsna consciousness
movement. There can be no happiness in changing one's material conditions, for everywhere there is
trouble and misery.
