<h2>Text</h2>
sri-narada uvaca
etavad brahmanayoktva
virarama maha-matih
tam sannibhartsya kupitah
sudino raja-sevakah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--Narada Muni said; etavat--this much; brahmanaya--unto the brahmanas, the sons of
Sukracarya; uktva--speaking; virarama--became silent; maha-matih--Prahlada Maharaja, who possessed
great intelligence; tam--him (Prahlada Maharaja); sannibhartsya--chastising very harshly; kupitah--being
angry; su-dinah--poor in thought, or very much aggrieved; raja-sevakah--the servants of King
Hiranyakasipu.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great saint Narada Muni continued: The great soul Prahlada Maharaja became silent after saying
this to his teachers, Sanda and Amarka, the seminal sons of Sukracarya. These so-called brahmanas then
became angry at him. Because they were servants of Hiranyakasipu, they were very sorry, and to chastise
Prahlada Maharaja they spoke as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word sukra means "semen." The sons of Sukracarya were brahmanas by birthright, but an actual
brahmana is one who possesses the brahminical qualities. The brahmanas Sanda and Amarka, being
seminal sons of Sukracarya, did not actually possess real brahminical qualifications, for they engaged as
servants of Hiranyakasipu. An actual brahmana is very much satisfied to see anyone, not to speak of his
disciple, become a devotee of Lord Krsna. Such brahmanas are meant to satisfy the supreme master. A
brahmana is strictly prohibited from becoming a servant of anyone else, for that is the business of dogs
and sudras. A dog must satisfy his master, but a brahmana does not have to satisfy anyone; he is simply
meant to satisfy Krsna (anukulyena krsnanusilanam). That is the real qualification of a brahmana. Because
Sanda and Amarka were seminal brahmanas and had become servants of such a master as Hiranyakasipu,
they unnecessarily wanted to chastise Prahlada Maharaja.
