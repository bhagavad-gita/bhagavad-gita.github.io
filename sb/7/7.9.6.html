<h2>Translation</h2>
By the touch of Lord Nrsimhadeva's hand on Prahlada Maharaja's head, Prahlada was completely freed
of all material contaminations and desires, as if he had been thoroughly cleansed. Therefore he at once
became transcendentally situated, and all the symptoms of ecstasy became manifest in his body. His heart
filled with love, and his eyes with tears, and thus he was able to completely capture the lotus feet of the
Lord within the core of his heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." Elsewhere in Bhagavadgita
(9.32) the Lord says:
mam hi partha vyapasritya
ye 'pi syuh papa-yonayah
striyo vaisyas tatha sudras
te 'pi yanti param gatim
"O son of Prtha, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth--women, vaisyas
[merchants], as well as sudras [workers]--can approach the supreme destination."
On the strength of these verses from Bhagavad-gita, it is evident that although Prahlada Maharaja was
born in a demoniac family and although virtually demoniac blood flowed within his body, he was
cleansed of all material bodily contamination because of his exalted position as a devotee. In other words,
such impediments on the spiritual path could not stop him from progressing, for he was directly in touch
with the Supreme personality of Godhead. Those who are physically and mentally contaminated by
atheism cannot be situated on the transcendental platform, but as soon as one is freed from material
contamination he is immediately fit to be situated in devotional service.
