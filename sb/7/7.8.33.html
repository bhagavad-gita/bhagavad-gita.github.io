dyauh--outer space; tat-sata--by His hair; utksipta--thrown up; vimana-sankula--filled with airplanes;
protsarpata--slipped out of place; ksma--the planet earth; ca--also; pada-abhipidita--distressed due to the
heavy weight of the lotus feet of the Lord; sailah--the hills and mountains; samutpetuh--sprang up;
amusya--of that one (the Lord); ramhasa--due to the intolerable force; tat-tejasa--by His effulgence;
kham--the sky; kakubhah--the ten directions; na rejire--did not shine.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Airplanes were thrown into outer space and the upper planetary system by the hair on Nrsimhadeva's
head. Because of the pressure of the Lord's lotus feet, the earth appeared to slip from its position, and all
the hills and mountains sprang up due to His intolerable force. Because of the Lord's bodily effulgence,
both the sky and all directions diminished in their natural illumination.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That there were airplanes flying in the sky long, long ago can be understood from this verse. Srimad-
Bhagavatam was spoken five thousand years ago, and the statements of this verse prove that the symptoms
of a very advanced civilization then existed, even in the upper planetary systems, as well as in the lower
planetary systems. Modern scientists and philosophers foolishly explain that there was no civilization
prior to three thousand years ago, but the statement of this verse nullifies such whimsical judgments. The
Vedic civilization existed millions and millions of years ago. It existed since the creation of this universe,
and it included arrangements all over the universe with all the modern amenities and even more.
