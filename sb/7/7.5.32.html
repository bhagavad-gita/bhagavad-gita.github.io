sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo-'bhisekam
niskincananam na vrnita yavat
<p></p>

the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is famous for performing uncommon activities; sprsati--does

<h2>Translation</h2>
Unless they smear upon their bodies the dust of the lotus feet of a Vaisnava completely freed from
material contamination, persons very much inclined toward materialistic life cannot be attached to the
lotus feet of the Lord, who is glorified for His uncommon activities. Only by becoming Krsna conscious
and taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord in this way can one be freed from material contamination.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Becoming Krsna conscious brings about anartha-apagamah, the disappearance of all anarthas, the
miserable conditions we have unnecessarily accepted. The material body is the basic principle of these
unwanted miserable conditions. The entire Vedic civilization is meant to relieve one from these unwanted
miseries, but persons bound by the laws of nature do not know the destination of life. As described in the
previous verse, isa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah: they are conditioned by the three strong modes of
material nature. The education that keeps the conditioned soul bound life after life is called materialistic
education. Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has explained that materialistic education expands the influence of
maya. Such an education induces the conditioned soul to be increasingly attracted to materialistic life and
to stray further and further away from liberation from unwanted miseries.
One may ask why highly educated persons do not take to Krsna consciousness. The reason is explained
in this verse. Unless one takes shelter of a bona fide, fully Krsna conscious spiritual master, there is no
chance of understanding Krsna. The educators, scholars and big political leaders worshiped by millions of
people cannot understand the goal of life and take to Krsna consciousness, for they have not accepted a
bona fide spiritual master and the Vedas. Therefore in the Mundaka Upanisad (3.2.3) it is said, nayam
atma pravacanena labhyo na medhaya na bahuna srutena: one cannot become self-realized simply by
having an academic education, by presenting lectures in an erudite way (pravacanena labhyah), or by
being an intelligent scientist who discovers many wonderful things. One cannot understand Krsna unless
one is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Only one who has surrendered to a pure devotee of
Krsna and taken the dust of his lotus feet can understand Krsna. First one must understand how to get
out of the clutches of maya. The only means is to become Krsna conscious. And to become Krsna
conscious very easily, one must take shelter of a realized soul--a mahat, or mahatma--whose only interest
is to engage in the service of the Supreme Lord. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.13):
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible." Therefore, to end the unwanted miseries of life, one must become a
devotee.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
"One who has unflinching devotional faith in Krsna consistently manifests all the good qualities of
Krsna and the demigods." (Bhag. 5.18.12)
yasya deva para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the
imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23)
yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyas
tasyaisa atma vivrnute tanum svam
"The Lord is obtained only by one whom He Himself chooses. To such a person He manifests His own
form." (Mundaka Upanisad 3.2.3)
These are Vedic injunctions. One must take shelter of a self-realized spiritual master, not a materially
educated scholar or politician. One must take shelter of a niskincana, a person engaged in devotional
service and free from material contamination. That is the way to return home, back to Godhead.
