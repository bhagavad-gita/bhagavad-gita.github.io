<h2>Translation</h2>
From the very beginning of his childhood, Prahlada Maharaja was uninterested in childish playthings.
Indeed, he gave them up altogether and remained silent and dull, being fully absorbed in Krsna
consciousness. Since his mind was always affected by Krsna consciousness, he could not understand how
the world goes on being fully absorbed in the activities of sense gratification.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja is the vivid example of a great person fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness. In
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.274) it is said:
sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara murti
sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphurti
A fully Krsna conscious person, although situated in this material world, does not see anything but
Krsna, anywhere and everywhere. This is the sign of a maha-bhagavata. The maha-bhagavata sees Krsna
everywhere because of his attitude of pure love for Krsna. As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with
the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara, situated within the heart of the devotee."
An exalted devotee, or mahatma, who is rarely to be seen, remains fully conscious of Krsna and constantly
sees the Lord within the core of his heart. It is sometimes said that when one is influenced by evil stars
like Saturn, Rahu or Ketu, he cannot make advancement in any prospective activity. In just the opposite
way, Prahlada Maharaja was influenced by Krsna, the supreme planet, and thus he could not think of the
material world and live without Krsna consciousness. That is the sign of a maha-bhagavata. Even if one is
an enemy of Krsna, a maha-bhagavata sees him to be also engaged in Krsna's service. Another crude
example is that everything appears yellow to the jaundiced eye. Similarly, to a maha-bhagavata, everyone
but himself appears to be engaged in Krsna's service.
Prahlada Maharaja is the approved maha-bhagavata, the supreme devotee. In the previous verse it was
stated that he had natural attachment (naisargiki ratih). The symptoms of such natural attachment for
Krsna are described in this verse. Although Prahlada Maharaja was only a boy, he had no interest in
playing. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.42), viraktir anyatra ca: the symptom of perfect Krsna
consciousness is that one loses interest in all material activities. For a small boy to give up playing is
impossible, but Prahlada Maharaja, being situated in first-class devotional service, was always absorbed in
a trance of Krsna consciousness. Just as a materialistic person is always absorbed in thoughts of material
gain, a maha-bhagavata like Prahlada Maharaja is always absorbed in thoughts of Krsna.
