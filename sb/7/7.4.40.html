vilajjo nrtyati kvacit
kvacit tad-bhavana-yuktas
tanmayo 'nucakara ha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nadati--exclaims loudly (addressing the Lord, "O Krsna"); kvacit--sometimes; utkanthah--being
anxious; vilajjah--without shame; nrtyati--he dances; kvacit--sometimes; kvacit--sometimes; tat-bhavana--
with thoughts of Krsna; yuktah--being absorbed; tat-mayah--thinking as if he had become Krsna;
anucakara--imitated; ha--indeed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sometimes, upon seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Prahlada Maharaja would loudly call in
full anxiety. He sometimes lost his shyness in jubilation and began dancing in ecstasy, and sometimes,
being fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, he felt oneness and imitated the pastimes of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja sometimes felt that the Lord was far away from him and therefore called Him loudly.
When he saw that the Lord was before him, he was fully jubilant. Sometimes, thinking himself one with
the Supreme, he imitated the Lord's pastimes, and in separation from the Lord he would sometimes show
symptoms of madness. These feelings of a devotee would not be appreciated by impersonalists. One must
go further and further into spiritual understanding. The first realization is impersonal Brahman, but one
must go still further to realize Paramatma and eventually the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
worshiped by the transcendental feelings of a devotee in a relationship of santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya or
madhurya. Here the feelings of Prahlada Maharaja were in the mellow of vatsalya, filial love and affection.
As a child cries when left by his mother, when Prahlada Maharaja felt that the Lord was away from him he
began to cry (nadati). Again, a devotee like Prahlada sometimes sees that the Lord is coming from a long
distance to pacify him, like a mother responding to a child, saying, "My dear child, do not cry. I am
coming." Then the devotee, without being ashamed due to his surroundings and circumstances, begins to
dance, thinking, "Here is my Lord! My Lord is coming!" Thus the devotee, in full ecstasy, sometimes
imitates the pastimes of the Lord, just as the cowherd boys used to imitate the behavior of the jungle
animals. However, he does not actually become the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja achieved the spiritual
ecstasies described herein by his advancement in spiritual understanding.
