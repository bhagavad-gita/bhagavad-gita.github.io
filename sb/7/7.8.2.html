<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya, observed that all the students, the sons of the
demons, were becoming advanced in Krsna consciousness because of the association of Prahlada
Maharaja, they were afraid. They approached the King of the demons and described the situation as it
was.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words buddhim ekanta-samsthitam indicate that as an effect of Prahlada Maharaja's preaching, the
students who listened to him became fixed in the conclusion that Krsna consciousness is the only object
of human life. The fact is that anyone who associates with a pure devotee and follows his instructions
becomes fixed in Krsna consciousness and is not disturbed by materialistic consciousness. The teachers
particularly observed this in their students, and therefore they were afraid because the whole community
of students was gradually becoming Krsna conscious.
