<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, when You appeared as Hayagriva, with the head of a horse, You killed two demons
known as Madhu and Kaitabha, who were full of the modes of passion and ignorance. Then You delivered
the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahma. For this reason, all the great saints accept Your forms as
transcendental, untinged by material qualities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form is always ready to give protection to
His devotees. As mentioned herein, the Lord in the form of Hayagriva killed two demons named Madhu
and Kaitabha when they attacked Lord Brahma. Modern demons think that there was no life in the
beginning of creation, but from Srimad-Bhagavatam we understand that the first living creature created by
the Supreme Personality of Godhead was Lord Brahma, who is full of Vedic understanding. Unfortunately,
those entrusted with distributing Vedic knowledge, such as the devotees engaged in spreading Krsna
consciousness, may sometimes be attacked by demons, but they must rest assured that demoniac attacks
will not be able to harm them, for the Lord is always prepared to give them protection. The Vedas provide
the knowledge by which we can understand the Supreme personality of Godhead (vedais ca sarvair aham
eva vedyah). The devotees of the Lord are always ready to spread knowledge by which one may
understand the Lord through Krsna consciousness, but the demons, being unable to understand the
Supreme Lord, are full of ignorance and passion. Thus the Lord, whose form is transcendental, is always
ready to kill the demons. By culturing the mode of goodness, one can understand the position of the
transcendental Lord and how the Lord is always prepared to remove all obstacles on the path of
understanding Him.
In summary, whenever the Lord incarnates, He appears in His original transcendental form. As the Lord
says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):
yada yada hi dharmasya
glanir bhavati bharata
abhyutthanam adharmasya
tadatmanam srjamy aham
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendent of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." It is simply foolish to think of the Lord as
being originally impersonal but accepting a material body when He appears as a personal incarnation.
Whenever the Lord appears, He appears in His original transcendental form, which is spiritual and
blissful. But unintelligent men, such as the Mayavadis, cannot understand the transcendental form of the
Lord, and therefore the Lord chastises them by saying, avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam:
"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form." Whenever the Lord appears, whether as a fish, a
tortoise, a hog or any other form, one should understand that He maintains His transcendental position
and that His only business, as stated here, is hatva--to kill the demons. The Lord appears in order to
protect the devotees and kill the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam). Since the demons
are always ready to oppose Vedic civilization, they are sure to be killed by the transcendental form of the
Lord.
