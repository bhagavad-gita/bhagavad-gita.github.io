<h2>Text</h2>
daiteya yaksa-raksamsi
striyah sudra vrajaukasah
khaga mrgah papa-jivah
santi hy acyutatam gatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
daiteyah--O demons; yaksa-raksamsi--the living entities known as the Yaksas and Raksasas; striyah--
women; sudrah--the laborer class; vraja-okasah--village cowherd men; khagah--birds; mrgah--animals;
papa-jivah--sinful living entities; santi--can become; hi--certainly; acyutatam--the qualities of Acyuta, the
Supreme Lord; gatah--obtained.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my friends, O sons of demons, everyone, including you (the Yaksas and Raksasas), the unintelligent
women, sudras and cowherd men, the birds, the lower animals and the sinful living entities, can revive his
original, eternal spiritual life and exist forever simply by accepting the principles of bhakti-yoga.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees are referred to as acyuta-gotra, or the dynasty of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
Lord is called Acyuta, as indicated in Bhagavad-gita (senayor ubhayor madhye ratham sthapaya me
'cyuta). The Lord is infallible in the material world because He is the supreme spiritual person. Similarly,
the jivas, who are part and parcel of the Lord, can also become infallible. Although Prahlada's mother was
in the conditional state and was the wife of a demon, even Yaksas, Raksasas, women, sudras and even
birds and other lower living entities can be elevated to the acyuta-gotra, the family of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. That is the highest perfection. As Krsna never falls, when we revive our spiritual
consciousness, Krsna consciousness, we never fall again to material existence. One should understand the
position of the supreme Acyuta, Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." One should
understand Acyuta, the supreme infallible, and how we are related with Him, and one should take to the
service of the Lord. This is the perfection of life. Srila Madhvacarya says, acyutatam cyuti-varjanam. The
word acyutatam refers to one who never falls to this material world but always remains in the Vaikuntha
world, fully engaged in the service of the Lord.
