<h2>Text</h2>
rajatas cauratah satroh
sva-janat pasu-paksitah
arthibhyah kalatah svasman
nityam pranarthavad bhayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajatah--from the government; cauratah--from thieves and rogues; satroh--from enemies; sva-janat--from
relatives; pasu-paksitah--from animals and birds; arthibhyah--from beggars and persons seeking charity;
kalatah--from the time factor; svasmat--as well as from one's self; nityam--always; prana-artha-vat--for one
who has life or money; bhayam--fear.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are considered materially powerful and rich are always full of anxieties because of
governmental laws, thieves and rogues, enemies, family members, animals, birds, persons seeking charity,
the inevitable time factor and even their own selves. Thus they are invariably afraid.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word svasmat means "from one's self." Because of attachment for money, the richest person is even
afraid of himself. He fears that he may have locked his money in an unsafe manner or might have
committed some mistake. Aside from the government and its income tax and aside from thieves, even a
rich man's own relatives are always thinking of how to take advantage of him and take away his money.
Sometimes these relatives are described as sva janaka-dasyu, which means "rogues and thieves in the guise
of relatives." Therefore, there is no need to accumulate wealth or unnecessarily endeavor for more and
more money. The real business of life is to ask "Who am I?" and to understand one's self. world and
understand how to return home, back to Godhead.
