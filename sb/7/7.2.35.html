<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/7/7.2.35.html">7.2.35</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
evam vilapatinam vai
parigrhya mrtam patim
anicchatinam nirharam
arko 'stam sannyavartata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; vilapatinam--of the lamenting queens; vai--indeed; parigrhya--taking on their laps; mrtam--
the dead; patim--husband; anicchatinam--not desiring; nirharam--the carrying out of the body for the
funeral ceremony; arkah--the sun; astam--the setting position; sannyavartata--passed away.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The time was appropriate for the body to be burned, but the queens, not allowing it to be taken away,
continued lamenting for the dead body, which they kept on their laps. In the meantime, the sun
completed its movements for setting in the west.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, if a person dies during the daytime it is customary for his funeral
ceremony to be performed before the sun sets, regardless of whether he is burned or buried, and if he dies
at night the funeral must be completed before the next sunrise. Apparently the queens continued
lamenting for the dead body, the lump of matter, and would not allow it to be taken away for burning.
This illustrates the strong grip of illusion among foolish persons who consider the body the self. Women
are generally considered less intelligent. Because of ignorance only, the queens thought of the dead body
as their husband and somehow or other thought that if the body were kept their husband would remain
with them. Such a conception of the self is certainly for go-khara--cows and asses. We have actually seen
that sometimes when a cow's calf has died the milkman cheats the cow by presenting before her the dead
body of her calf. Thus the cow, who would not otherwise allow milking, licks the dead body of the calf
and allows herself to be milked. This substantiates the description of the sastra that a foolish man in the
bodily concept of life is like a cow. Not only do foolish men and women consider the body the self, but we
have even seen that the dead body of a so-called yogi was kept for days by his disciples, who thought that
their guru was in samadhi. When decomposition began and a bad smell unfortunately began to
overwhelm the yogic power, the disciples allowed the dead body of the so-called yogi to be burned. Thus
the bodily concept of life is extremely strong among foolish persons, who are compared to cows and asses.
Nowadays, great scientists are trying to freeze dead bodies so that in the future these frozen bodies may
again be brought to life. The incident narrated by Hiranyakasipu from history must have taken place
millions of years ago because Hiranyakasipu lived millions of years ago and was even then quoting from
history. Thus the incident occurred before Hiranyakasipu's lifetime, but the same ignorance in the bodily
concept of life is still prevalent, not only among laymen but even among scientists who think they will be
able to revive frozen corpses.
Apparently the queens did not want to deliver the dead body for burning because they were afraid of
dying with the dead body of their husband.
