<h2>Text</h2>
etad dvaro hi samsaro
guna-karma-nibandhanah
ajnana-mulo 'partho 'pi
pumsah svapna ivarpyate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--this; dvarah--whose door; hi--indeed; samsarah--material existence, in which one suffers threefold
miseries; guna-karma-nibandhanah--captivation by the three modes of material nature; ajnana-mulah--
whose root is ignorance; aparthah--without factual meaning; api--even; pumsah--of the living entity;
svapnah--a dream; iva--like; arpyate--is placed.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Through polluted intelligence one is subjected to the modes of nature, and thus one is conditioned by
material existence. Like a dreaming state in which one falsely suffers, material existence, which is due to
ignorance, must be considered unwanted and temporary.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The unwanted condition of temporary life is called ignorance. One can very easily understand that the
material body is temporary, for it is generated at a certain date and ends at a certain date, after undergoing
the six kinds of change, namely birth, death, growth, maintenance, transformation and dwindling. This
condition of the eternal soul is due to his ignorance, and although it is temporary, it is unwanted. Because
of ignorance one is put into temporary bodies one after another. The spirit soul, however, does not need
to enter such temporary bodies. He does so only due to his ignorance or his forgetfulness of Krsna.
Therefore in the human form of life, when one's intelligence is developed, one should change his
consciousness by trying to understand Krsna. Then one can be liberated. This is confirmed in Bhagavadgita
(4.9), where the Lord says:
janma karma ca me divyam
evam yo vetti tattvatah
tyaktva deham punar janma
naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
"One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the
body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna." Unless one
understands Krsna and comes to Krsna consciousness, one must continue in material bondage. To end
this conditional life, one must surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, that is
demanded by the Supreme Lord. Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja.
As advised by Maharaja Rsabhadeva, na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam asann api klesada asa dehah.
One must be intelligent enough to understand that although one's body is temporary and will not endure
for long, as long as one has a body he must undergo the pangs of material existence. Therefore, if by good
association, by the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master, one takes to Krsna consciousness, his
conditional life of material existence is vanquished, and his original consciousness, known as Krsna
consciousness, is revived. When one is Krsna conscious, he can realize that material existence, whether
one is awake or dreaming, is nothing but a dream and has no factual value. This realization is possible by
the grace of the Supreme Lord. This grace is also present in the form of the instructions of Bhagavad-gita.
Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission is for everyone to engage in welfare activities to awaken the
foolish living entity, especially in human society, so that he may come to the platform of Krsna
consciousness and benefit by liberation from conditional life.
In this connection, Srila Madhvacarya cites the following verses:
duhkha-rupo 'pi samsaro
buddhi-purvam avapyate
yatha svapne siras chedam
svayam krtvatmano vasah
tato duhkham avapyeta
tatha jagarito 'pi tu
janann apy atmano duhkham
avasas tu pravartate
One must realize that the material condition of life is full of distresses. One can realize this with purified
intelligence. When one's intelligence is purified, he can understand that unwanted, temporary, material
life is just like a dream. Just as one suffers pain when his head is cut off in a dream, in ignorance one
suffers not only while dreaming but also while awake. Without the mercy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one continues in ignorance and is thus subjected to material distresses in various ways.
