<h2>Text</h2>
dvau daive pitr-karye trin
ekaikam ubhayatra va
bhojayet susamrddho 'pi
sraddhe kuryan na vistaram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dvau--two; daive--during the period when oblations are offered to the demigods; pitr-karye--in the
sraddha ceremony, in which oblations are offered to the forefathers; trin--three; eka--one; ekam--one;
ubhayatra--for both occasions; va--either; bhojayet--one should feed; su-samrddhah api--even though one
is very rich; sraddhe--when offering oblations to the forefathers; kuryat--one should do; na--not;
vistaram--very expensive arrangements.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
During the period for offering oblations to the demigods, one should invite only two brahmanas, and
while offering oblations to the forefathers, one may invite three brahmanas. Or, in either case, only one
brahmana will suffice. Even though one is very opulent, he should not endeavor to invite more brahmanas
or make various expensive arrangements on those occasions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As we have already mentioned, Srila Advaita Acarya, during the generally observed ceremony to offer
oblations to the forefathers, invited only Haridasa Thakura. Thus He followed this principle: na
me'bhaktas catur-vedi mad-bhaktah sva-pacah priyah. The Lord says, "It is not necessary that one become
very expert in Vedic knowledge before he can become My bhakta, or devotee. Even if one is born in a
family of dog-eaters, he can become My devotee and be very dear to Me, in spite of having taken birth in
such a family. Therefore, offerings should be given to My devotee, and whatever My devotee has offered
Me should be accepted." Following this principle, one should invite a first-class brahmana or Vaisnava--a
realized soul--and feed him while observing the sraddha ceremony to offer oblations to one's forefathers.
