<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja continued: My dear friends, if you can place your faith in my words, simply by that
faith you can also understand transcendental knowledge, just like me, although you are small children.
Similarly, a woman can also understand transcendental knowledge and know what is spirit and what is
matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These words of Prahlada Maharaja are very important in regard to knowledge descending by the
disciplic succession. Even when Prahlada Maharaja was a baby within the womb of his mother, he became
fully convinced of the existence of the supreme power because of hearing the powerful instructions of
Narada and understood how to attain perfection in life by bhakti-yoga. These are the most important
understandings in spiritual knowledge.
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports
of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23)
atah sri-krsna-namadi
na bhaved grahyam indriyaih
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau
svayam eva sphuraty adah
"No one can understand Krsna as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the
devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him." (Bhakti-rasamrtasindhu
1.2.234)
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in
full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God." (Bg.
18.55)
These are Vedic instructions. One must have full faith in the words of the spiritual master and similar
faith in the Supreme personality of Godhead. Then the real knowledge of atma and Paramatma and the
distinction between matter and spirit will be automatically revealed. This atma-tattva, or spiritual
knowledge, will be revealed within the core of a devotee's heart because of his having taken shelter of the
lotus feet of a mahajana such as Prahlada Maharaja.
In this verse the word bhuyat may be understood to mean "let there be." Prahlada Maharaja offers his
blessings to his class friends, saying, "Also become faithful like me. Become bona fide Vaisnavas." A
devotee of the Lord desires for everyone to take to Krsna consciousness. Unfortunately, however, people
sometimes do not have staunch faith in the words of the spiritual master who comes by the disciplic
succession, and therefore they are unable to understand transcendental knowledge. The spiritual master
must be in the line of authorized disciplic succession, like Prahlada Maharaja, who received the
knowledge from Narada. If the class friends of Prahlada Maharaja, the sons of demons, were to accept the
truth through Prahlada, they would certainly also become fully aware of transcendental knowledge.
The words vaisaradi dhih refer to intelligence concerning the Supreme personality of Godhead, who is
extremely expert. The Lord has created wonderful universes by His expert knowledge. Unless one is
extremely expert, he cannot understand the expert management of the supreme expert. One can
understand, however, if one is fortunate enough to meet a bona fide spiritual master coming in the
disciplic succession from Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Mother Laksmi or the Kumaras. These four
sampradayas, or disciplic successions of knowledge and transcendence, are called the Brahmasampradaya,
Rudra-sampradaya, Sri-sampradaya, and Kumara-sampradaya. Sampradaya-vihina ye mantras
te nisphala matah. The knowledge of the Supreme received from such a sampradaya, or disciplic
succession, can give one enlightenment. If one does not take to the path of disciplic succession, it is not
possible for one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one understands the Supreme Lord
through devotional service with faith in the disciplic succession and then advances further, he awakens
his natural love for God, and then his success in life is assured.
