<h2>Translation</h2>
King Indra said: O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which
are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king
Hiranyakasipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by
him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for
those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is
insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of kama, artha and dharma.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this material world there are two kinds of people--the devatas (demigods) and the asuras (demons).
Although the demigods are attached to material enjoyment, they are devotees of the Lord who act
according to the rules and regulations of the Vedic injunctions. During the reign of Hiranyakasipu,
everyone was disturbed in the routine duties of Vedic civilization. When Hiranyakasipu was killed, all the
demigods, who had always been disturbed by Hiranyakasipu, felt relief in their general way of life.
Because the government in Kali-yuga is full of demons, the living conditions of devotees are always
disturbed. Devotees cannot perform yajna, and thus they cannot partake of the remnants of food offered
in yajna for the worship of Lord Visnu. The hearts of the demigods are always filled with fear of the
demons, and therefore they cannot think of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The engagement of the
demigods is to think of the Lord always within the cores of their hearts. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(6.47):
yoginam api sarvesam
mad gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." The demigods fully absorb
themselves in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead to become perfect yogis, but because
of the presence of demons, their hearts are filled with the activities of the demons. Thus their hearts,
which are meant to be the abode of the Supreme Lord, are practically occupied by the demons. All the
demigods felt relieved when Hiranyakasipu was dead, for they could easily think of the Lord. They could
then receive the results of sacrifices and become happy even though in the material world.
