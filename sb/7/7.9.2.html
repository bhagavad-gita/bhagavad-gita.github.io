athacarya-sutas tesam
buddhim ekanta-samsthitam
alaksya bhitas tvarito
rajna avedayad yatha
SYNONYMS
atha--thereupon; acarya-sutah--the son of Sukracarya; tesam--of them (the sons of the demons);
buddhim--the intelligence; ekanta-samsthitam--fixed in one subject matter, devotional service; alaksya--
realizing or seeing practically; bhitah--being afraid; tvaritah--as soon as possible; rajne--unto the King
(Hiranyakasipu); avedayat--submitted; yatha--fittingly.
TRANSLATION
When Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya, observed that all the students, the sons of the
demons, were becoming advanced in Krsna consciousness because of the association of Prahlada
Maharaja, they were afraid. They approached the King of the demons and described the situation as it
was.
PURPORT
The words buddhim ekanta-samsthitam indicate that as an effect of Prahlada Maharaja's preaching, the
students who listened to him became fixed in the conclusion that Krsna consciousness is the only object
of human life. The fact is that anyone who associates with a pure devotee and follows his instructions
becomes fixed in Krsna consciousness and is not disturbed by materialistic consciousness. The teachers
particularly observed this in their students, and therefore they were afraid because the whole community
of students was gradually becoming Krsna conscious.

TRANSLATION
When Hiranyakasipu understood the entire situation, he was extremely angry, so much so that his body
trembled. Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahlada. Hiranyakasipu was by nature very cruel, and
feeling insulted, he began hissing like a snake trampled upon by someone's foot. His son Prahlada was
peaceful, mild and gentle, his senses were under control, and he stood before Hiranyakasipu with folded
hands. According to Prahlada's age and behavior, he was not to be chastised. Yet with staring, crooked
eyes, Hiranyakasipu rebuked him with the following harsh words.
PURPORT
When one is impudent toward a highly authorized devotee, one is punished by the laws of nature. The
duration of his life is diminished, and he loses the blessings of superior persons and the results of pious
activities. Hiranyakasipu, for example, had achieved such great power in the material world that he could
subdue practically all the planetary systems in the universe, including the heavenly planets (Svargaloka).
Yet now, because of his mistreatment of such a Vaisnava as Prahlada Maharaja, all the results of his
tapasya diminished. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.4.46):
ayuh sriyam yaso dharmam
lokan asisa eva ca
hanti sreyamsi sarvani
pumso mahad-atikramah
"When one mistreats great souls, his life span, opulence, reputation, religion, possessions and good
fortune are all destroyed."
