<h2>Translation</h2>
The steps of King Indra's residence were made of coral, the floor was bedecked with invaluable
emeralds, the walls were of crystal, and the columns of vaidurya stone. The wonderful canopies were
beautifully decorated, the seats were bedecked with rubies, and the silk bedding, as white as foam, was
decorated with pearls. The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most
wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously,
and saw their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods, however, being very much oppressed,
had to bow down and offer obeisances at the feet of Hiranyakasipu, who chastised the demigods very
severely and for no reason. Thus Hiranyakasipu lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu was so powerful in the heavenly planets that all the demigods except Lord Brahma, Lord
Siva and Lord Visnu were forced to engage in his service. Indeed, they were afraid of being severely
punished if they disobeyed him. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti has compared Hiranyakasipu to Maharaja
Vena, who was also atheistic and scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. Yet
Maharaja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bhrgu, whereas Hiranyakasipu ruled in such a
way that everyone feared him but Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Hiranyakasipu was so alert
against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bhrgu that by dint of austerity he surpassed
their power and placed even them under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary
systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances are created by asuras like
Hiranyakasipu. No one in the three worlds can live in peace and prosperity without disturbance.
