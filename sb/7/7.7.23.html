<h2>Text</h2>
dehas tu sarva-sanghato
jagat tasthur iti dvidha
atraiva mrgyah puruso
neti netity atat tyajan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dehah--the body; tu--but; sarva-sanghatah--the combination of all the twenty-four elements; jagat--seen
to be moving; tasthuh--and standing in one place; iti--thus; dvidha--two kinds; atra eva--in this matter;
mrgyah--to be searched for; purusah--the living entity, the soul; na--not; iti--thus; na--not; iti--thus; iti--in
this way; atat--what is not spirit; tyajan--giving up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There are two kinds of bodies for every individual soul--a gross body made of five gross elements and a
subtle body made of three subtle elements. Within these bodies, however, is the spirit soul. One must find
the soul by analysis, saying, "This is not it. This is not it." Thus one must separate spirit from matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As previously stated, svarnam yatha gravasu hema-karah ksetresu yogais tad-abhijna apnuyat. An expert
in the study of soil can find out where gold is and then dig there. He can then analyze the stone and test
the gold with nitric acid. Similarly, one must analyze the whole body to find within the body the spirit
soul. In studying one's own body, one must ask himself whether his head is his soul, his fingers are his
soul, his hand is his soul, and so on. In this way, one must gradually reject all the material elements and
the combinations of material elements in the body. Then, if one is expert and follows the acarya, he can
understand that he is the spiritual soul living within the body. The greatest acarya, Krsna, begins His
teachings in Bhagavad-gita by saying:
dehino 'smin yatha dehe
kaumaram yauvanam jara
tatha dehantara-praptir
dhiras tatra na muhyati
"As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul
similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
(Bg. 2.13) The spirit soul possesses the body and is within the body. This is the real analysis. The soul
never mixes with the bodily elements. Although the soul is within the body, it is separate and always
pure. One must analyze and understand his self. This is self-realization. Neti neti is the analytical process
of rejecting matter. By expertly conducting such an analysis, one can understand where the soul is. One
who is not expert, however, cannot distinguish gold from earth, nor the soul from the body.
