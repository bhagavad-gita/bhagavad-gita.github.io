<h2>Text</h2>
evam aisvarya-mattasya
drptasyocchastra-vartinah
kalo mahan vyatiyaya
brahma-sapam upeyusah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; aisvarya-mattasya--of one who was intoxicated by opulences; drptasya--greatly proud; utsastra-
vartinah--transgressing the regulative principles mentioned in the sastras; kalah--duration of time;
mahan--a great; vyatiyaya--passed; brahma-sapam--a curse by exalted brahmanas; upeyusah--having
obtained.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Hiranyakasipu thus passed a long time being very much proud of his opulences and transgressing the
laws and regulations mentioned in the authoritative sastras. He was therefore subjected to a curse by the
four Kumaras, who were great brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There have been many instances in which demons, after achieving material opulences, have become
extremely proud, so much so that they have transgressed the laws and regulations given in the
authoritative sastras. Hiranyakasipu acted in this way. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (16.23):
yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya
vartate kama-karatah
na sa siddhim avapnoti
na sukham na param gatim
"He who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection,
nor happiness, nor the supreme destination." The word sastra refers to that which controls our activities.
We cannot violate or transgress the laws and regulative principles mentioned in the sastras. Bhagavad-gita
repeatedly confirms this.
tasmac chastram pramanam te
karyakarya-vyavasthitau
jnatva sastra-vidhanoktam
karma kartum iharhasi
"One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures.
Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated." (Bg. 16.24)
One should act according to the direction of the sastra, but the material energy is so powerful that as soon
as one becomes materially opulent, he begins to transgress the sastric laws. As soon as one transgresses
the laws of sastra, he immediately enters upon the path of destruction.
