<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni continued: By devotional service one cannot achieve such intense absorption in thought of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as one can through enmity toward Him. That is my opinion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sriman Narada Muni, the topmost pure devotee, praises Krsna's enemies like Sisupala because their
minds are always completely absorbed in Krsna. Indeed, he thinks himself deficient in the inspiration of
being feelingly absorbed in Krsna consciousness. This does not mean, however, that the enemies of Krsna
are more elevated than Krsna's pure devotees. In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi 5.205) Krsnadasa Kaviraja
Gosvami also thinks of himself in such a humble way:
jagai madhai haite muni se papistha
purisera kita haite muni se laghistha
"I am a worse sinner than Jagai and Madhai and am even lower than the worms in the stool." A pure
devotee always thinks himself more deficient than everyone else. If a devotee approaches Srimati
Radharani to offer some service to Krsna, even Srimati Radharani thinks that the devotee is greater than
She. Thus Narada Muni says that according to his opinion the enemies of Krsna are better situated
because they are fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna in terms of killing Him, just as a very lusty man
always thinks of women and their association.
The essential point in this connection is that one should be fully absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, twentyfour
hours a day. There are many devotees in raga-marga, which is exhibited in Vrndavana. Whether in
dasya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vatsalya-rasa or madhurya-rasa, all the devotees of Krsna are always overwhelmed
by thoughts of Krsna. When Krsna is away from Vrndavana tending the cows in the forest, the gopis, in
the madhurya-rasa, are always absorbed in thoughts of how Krsna walks in the forest. The soles of His feet
are so soft that the gopis would not dare keep His lotus feet on their soft breasts. Indeed, they consider
their breasts a very hard place for the lotus feet of Krsna, yet those lotus feet wander in the forest, which is
full of thorny plants. The gopis are absorbed in such thoughts at home, although Krsna is away from
them. Similarly, when Krsna plays with His young friends, mother Yasoda is very much disturbed by
thoughts that Krsna, because of always playing and not taking His food properly, must be getting weak.
These are examples of the exalted ecstasy felt in Krsna's service as manifested in Vrndavana. This service
is indirectly praised by Narada Muni in this verse. Especially for the conditioned soul, Narada Muni
recommends that one somehow or other be absorbed in thoughts of Krsna, for that will save one from all
the dangers of material existence. Full absorption in thought of Krsna is the highest platform of bhaktiyoga.
