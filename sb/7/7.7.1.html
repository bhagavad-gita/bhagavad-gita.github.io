<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--the great saint Narada Muni said; evam--thus; daitya-sutaih--by the sons of the
demons; prstah--being questioned; maha-bhagavatah--the exalted devotee of the Lord; asurah--born in a
family of demons; uvaca--spoke; tan--unto them (the sons of the demons); smayamanah--smiling;
smaran--remembering; mat-anubhasitam--what was spoken by me.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni said: Although Prahlada Maharaja was born in a family of asuras, he was the greatest of all
devotees. Having thus been questioned by his class friends, the sons of the asuras, he remembered the
words spoken to him by me and replied to his friends as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When he was in the womb of his mother, Prahlada Maharaja listened to the words of Narada Muni. One
cannot imagine how the baby in embryo could hear Narada, but this is spiritual life; progress in spiritual
life cannot be obstructed by any material condition. This is called ahaituky apratihata. Reception of
spiritual knowledge is never checked by any material condition. Thus Prahlada Maharaja, from his very
childhood, spoke spiritual knowledge to his class friends, and certainly it was effective, although all of
them were children.
