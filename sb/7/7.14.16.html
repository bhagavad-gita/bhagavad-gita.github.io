<h2>Text</h2>
yarhy atmano 'dhikaradyah
sarvah syur yajna-sampadah
vaitanikena vidhina
agni-hotradina yajet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yarhi--when; atmanah--of one's self; adhikara-adyah--things possessed by him under full control;
sarvah--everything; syuh--becomes; yajna-sampadah--paraphernalia for performing yajna, or the means
for pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vaitanikena--with authorized books that direct the
performance of yajna; vidhina--according to regulative principles; agni-hotra-adina--by offering sacrifices
to the fire, etc.; yajet--one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When one is enriched with wealth and knowledge which are under his full control and by means of
which he can perform yajna or please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must perform sacrifices,
offering oblations to the fire according to the directions of the sastras. In this way one should worship the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
If a grhastha, or householder, is sufficiently educated in Vedic knowledge and has become sufficiently
rich to offer worship to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he must perform yajnas as directed
by the authorized scriptures. Bhagavad-gita (3.9) clearly says, yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam
karma-bandhanah: everyone may be engaged in his occupational duties, but the result of these duties
should be offered for sacrifice to satisfy the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to possess
transcendental knowledge as well as the money with which to perform sacrifices, one must do it
according to the directions given in the sastras. It is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.3.52):
krte yad dhyayato visnum
tretayam yajato makhaih
dvapare paricaryayam
kalau tad dhari-kirtanat
The entire Vedic civilization aims at satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This was possible
in Satya-yuga by meditation upon the Supreme Lord within the core of one's heart and in Treta-yuga by
the performance of costly yajnas. The same goal could be achieved in Dvapara-yuga by worship of the
Lord in the temple, and in this age of Kali one can achieve the same goal by performing sankirtana-yajna.
Therefore one who has education and wealth must use them to satisfy the Supreme Personality of
Godhead by helping the sankirtana movement that has already begun--the Hare Krsna movement, or
Krsna consciousness movement. All educated and wealthy persons must join this movement, since money
and education are meant for service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If money and education are
not engaged in the service of the Lord, these valuable assets must be engaged in the service of maya. The
education of so-called scientists, philosophers and poets is now engaged in the service of maya, and the
wealth of the rich is also engaged in maya's service. The service of maya, however, creates a chaotic
condition in the world. Therefore the wealthy man and the educated man should sacrifice their
knowledge and opulence by dedicating them for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord and joining this
sankirtana movement (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah).
