<h2>Text</h2>
pasyami dhaninam klesam
lubdhanam ajitatmanam
bhayad alabdha-nidranam
sarvato 'bhivisankinam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pasyami--I can practically see; dhaninam--of persons who are very rich; klesam--the miseries;
lubdhanam--who are extremely greedy; ajita-atmanam--who are victims of their senses; bhayat--because of
fear; alabdha-nidranam--who are suffering from insomnia; sarvatah--from all sides; abhivisankinam--being
particularly afraid.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The brahmana continued: I am actually seeing how a rich man, who is a victim of his senses, is very
greedy to accumulate wealth, and therefore suffers from insomnia due to fear from all sides, despite his
wealth and opulence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Greedy capitalists accumulate wealth under so many miserable conditions, the result being that because
they collect money by questionable means, their minds are always agitated. Thus they are unable to sleep
at night, and they have to take pills for mental tranquillity to invite sleep. And sometimes even the pills
are a failure. Consequently the result of having accumulated money by so much labor is certainly not
happiness, but only distress. What is the value of acquiring a comfortable position if one's mind is always
disturbed? Narottama dasa Thakura has therefore sung:
samsara-bisanale, dibanisi hiya jvale,
judaite na kainu upaya
"I am suffering from the poisonous effect of material enjoyment. Thus my heart is always burning and is
almost on the verge of failure." The result of the greedy capitalist's unnecessary accumulation of wealth is
that he must suffer from a blazing fire of anxiety and always be concerned with how to save his money
and invest it properly to get more and more. Such a life is certainly not very happy, but because of the
spell of the illusory energy, materialistic persons engage in such activities.
As far as our Krsna consciousness movement is concerned, we are getting money naturally, by the grace
of God, by selling our literature. This literature is not sold for our sense gratification; to spread the Krsna
consciousness movement we need so many things, and Krsna is therefore supplying us the requisite
money to advance this mission. The mission of Krsna is to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world,
and for this purpose we naturally must have sufficient money. Therefore, according to the advice of Srila
Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada, we should not give up attachment to money that can spread the Krsna
consciousness movement. Srila Rupa Gosvami says in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.256):
prapancikataya buddhya
hari-sambandhi-vastunah
mumuksubhih parityago
vairagyam phalgu kathyate
"When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things which are related to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, though they are material, this is called incomplete renunciation." Money that can
help in spreading the Krsna consciousness movement is not a part of the material world, and we should
not give it up, thinking that it is material. Srila Rupa Gosvami advises:
anasaktasya visayan
yatharham upayunjatah
nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe
yuktam vairagyam ucyate
"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Krsna, one
is rightly situated above possessiveness." (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.2.255) Money is undoubtedly coming
in great quantities, but we should not be attached to this money for sense gratification; every cent should
be spent for spreading the Krsna consciousness movement, not for sense gratification. There is danger for
a preacher when he receives great quantities of money, for as soon as he spends even a single cent of the
collection for his personal sense gratification, he becomes a fallen victim. The preachers of the Krsna
consciousness movement should be extremely careful not to misuse the immense quantities of money
needed to spread this movement. Let us not make this money the cause of our distress; it should be used
for Krsna, and that will cause our eternal happiness. Money is Laksmi, or the goddess of fortune, the
companion of Narayana. Laksmiji must always remain with Narayana, and then there need be no fear of
degradation.
