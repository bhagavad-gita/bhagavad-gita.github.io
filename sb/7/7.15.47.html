pravrttam ca nivrttam ca
dvi-vidham karma vaidikam
avartate pravrttena
nivrttenasnute 'mrtam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pravrttam--inclination for material enjoyment; ca--and; nivrttam--cessation of material enjoyment; ca--
and; dvi-vidham--these two varieties; karma--of activities; vaidikam--recommended in the Vedas;
avartate--one travels up and down through the cycle of samsara; pravrttena--by an inclination for enjoying
material activities; nivrttena--but by ceasing such activities; asnute--one enjoys; amrtam--eternal life.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
According to the Vedas, there are two kinds of activities--pravrtti and nivrtti. Pravrtti activities involve
raising oneself from a lower to a higher condition of materialistic life, whereas nivrtti means the cessation
of material desire. Through pravrtti activities one suffers from material entanglement, but by nivrtti
activities one is purified and becomes fit to enjoy eternal, blissful life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (16.7), pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidur asurah: the asuras,
nondevotees, cannot distinguish between pravrtti and nivrtti. Whatever they like they do. Such persons
think themselves independent of the strong material nature, and therefore they are irresponsible and do
not care to act piously. Indeed, they do not distinguish between pious and impious activity. Bhakti, of
course, does not depend on pious or impious activity. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6):
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
"The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving
devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and
uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self." Nonetheless, those who act piously have a better
chance to become devotees. As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.16), catur-vidha bhajante mam janah
sukrtino 'rjuna: "O Arjuna, four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me." One who takes to
devotional service, even with some material motive, is considered pious, and because he has come to
Krsna, he will gradually come to the stage of bhakti. Then, like Dhruva Maharaja, he will refuse to accept
any material benediction from the Lord (svamin krtartho 'smi varam na yace). Therefore, even if one is
materially inclined, one may take to the shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna and Balarama, or Gaura and
Nitai, so that he will very soon be purified of all material desires (ksipram bhavati dharmatma sasvac
chantim nigacchati). As soon as one is freed from inclinations toward pious and impious activities, he
becomes a perfect candidate for returning home, back to Godhead.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices known as agni-hotra-yajna, darsa-yajna, purnamasa-yajna,
caturmasya-yajna, pasu-yajna and soma-yajna are all symptomized by the killing of animals and the
burning of many valuables, especially food grains, all for the fulfillment of material desires and the
creation of anxiety. Performing such sacrifices, worshiping Vaisvadeva, and performing the ceremony of
Baliharana, which all supposedly constitute the goal of life, as well as constructing temples for demigods,
building resting houses and gardens, digging wells for the distribution of water, establishing booths for
the distribution of food, and performing activities for public welfare--these are all symptomized by
attachment to material desires.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King Yudhisthira, when oblations of ghee and food grains like barley and sesame are offered in
sacrifice, they turn into celestial smoke, which carries one to successively higher planetary systems like
the kingdoms of Dhuma, Ratri, Krsnapaksa, Daksinam and ultimately the moon. Then, however, the
performers of sacrifice descend again to earth to become herbs, creepers, vegetables and food grains.
These are eaten by different living entities and turned to semen, which is injected into female bodies.
Thus one takes birth again and again.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.21):
te tam bhuktva svarga-lokam visalam
ksine punye martya-lokam visanti
evam trayi-dharmam anuprapanna
gatagatam kama-kama labhante
"When those who follow the pravrtti-marga have enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this
mortal planet again. Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve only flickering happiness."
Following the pravrtti-marga, the living entity who desires to be promoted to the higher planetary systems
performs sacrifices regularly, and how he goes up and comes down again is described here in Srimad-
Bhagavatam, as well as in Bhagavad-gita. It is also said, traigunya-visaya vedah: "The Vedas deal mainly
with the three modes of material nature." The Vedas, especially three Vedas, namely Sama, Yajur and Rk,
vividly describe this process of ascending to the higher planets and returning. But Krsna advises Arjuna,
traigunya-visaya veda nistraigunyo bhavarjuna: one has to transcend these three modes of material nature,
and then one will be released from the cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, although one may be
promoted to a higher planetary system such as Candraloka, one must again come down (ksine punye
martya-lokam visanti). After one's enjoyment due to pious activities is finished, one must return to this
planet in rainfall and first take birth as a plant or creeper, which is eaten by various animals, including
human beings, and turned to semen. This semen is injected into the female body, and thus the living
entity takes birth. Those who return to earth in this way take birth especially in higher families like those
of brahmanas.
It may be remarked in this connection that even the modern so-called scientists who are going to the
moon are not able to stay there, but are returning to their laboratories. Therefore, whether one goes to the
moon by modern mechanical arrangements or by performing pious activities, one must return to earth.
That is clearly stated in this verse and explained in Bhagavad-gita. Even if one goes to the higher planetary
systems (yanti deva-vrata devan), one's place there is not secure; one must return to martya-loka.
Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino 'rjuna: aside from the moon, even if one goes to Brahmaloka,
one must return. Yam prapya na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama: but if one goes back home, back
to Godhead, he need not return to this material world.
