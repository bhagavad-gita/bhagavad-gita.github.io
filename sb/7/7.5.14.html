<h2>Text</h2>
yatha bhramyaty ayo brahman
svayam akarsa-sannidhau
tatha me bhidyate cetas
cakra-paner yadrcchaya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--just as; bhramyati--moves; ayah--iron; brahman--O brahmanas; svayam--itself; akarsa--of a
magnet; sannidhau--in the proximity; tatha--similarly; me--my; bhidyate--is changed; cetah--
consciousness; cakra-paneh--of Lord Visnu, who has a disc in His hand; yadrcchaya--simply by the will.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O brahmanas [teachers], as iron attracted by a magnetic stone moves automatically toward the magnet,
my consciousness, having been changed by His will, is attracted by Lord Visnu, who carries a disc in His
hand. Thus I have no independence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
For iron to be attracted by a magnet is natural. Similarly, for all living entities to be attracted toward
Krsna is natural, and therefore the Lord's real name is Krsna, meaning He who attracts everyone and
everything. The typical examples of such attraction are found in Vrndavana, where everything and
everyone is attracted by Krsna. The elderly persons like Nanda Maharaja and Yasodadevi, the friends like
Sridama, Sudama and the other cowherd boys, the gopis like Srimati Radharani and Her associates, and
even the birds, beasts, cows and calves are attracted. The flowers and fruits in the gardens are attracted,
the waves of the Yamuna are attracted, and the land, sky, trees, plants, animals and all other living beings
are attracted by Krsna. This is the natural situation of everything in Vrndavana.
Just contrary to the affairs of Vrndavana is the material world, where no one is attracted by Krsna and
everyone is attracted by maya. This is the difference between the spiritual and material worlds.
Hiranyakasipu, who was in the material world, was attracted by women and money, whereas Prahlada
Maharaja, being in his natural position, was attracted by Krsna. In replying to Hiranyakasipu's question
about why Prahlada Maharaja had a deviant view, Prahlada said that his view was not deviant, for the
natural position of everyone is to be attracted by Krsna. Hiranyakasipu found this view deviant, Prahlada
said, because of being unnaturally unattracted by Krsna. Hiranyakasipu therefore needed purification.
As soon as one is purified of material contamination, he is again attracted by Krsna (sarvopadhivinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam). In the material world, everyone is contaminated by the dirt of
sense gratification and is acting according to different designations, sometimes as a human being,
sometimes a beast, sometimes a demigod or tree, and so on. One must be cleansed of all these
designations. Then one will be naturally attracted to Krsna. The bhakti process purifies the living entity of
all unnatural attractions. When one is purified he is attracted by Krsna and begins to serve Krsna instead
of serving maya. This is his natural position. A devotee is attracted by Krsna, whereas a nondevotee, being
contaminated by the dirt of material enjoyment, is not. This is confirmed by the Lord in Bhagavad-gita
(7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
"Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely
eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with
determination." One must be freed from all the sinful dirt of material existence. Everyone in this material
world is contaminated by material desire. Unless one is free from all material desire (anyabhilasitasunyam),
one cannot be attracted by Krsna.
