<h2>Text</h2>
tatropaya-sahasranam
ayam bhagavatoditah
yad isvare bhagavati
yatha yair anjasa ratih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--in that connection (getting out of the entanglement of material conditioning); upaya--of
processes; sahasranam--of many thousands; ayam--this; bhagavata uditah--given by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; yat--which; isvare--to the Lord; bhagavati--the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
yatha--as much as; yaih--by which; anjasa--quickly; ratih--attachment with love and affection.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Of the different processes recommended for disentanglement from material life, the one personally
explained and accepted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be considered all-perfect. That
process is the performance of duties by which love for the Supreme Lord develops.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Among the linking processes that elevate one from bondage to material contamination, the one
recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be accepted as the best. That process is
clearly explained in Bhagavad-gita, where the Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam
vraja: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me." This process is the best because the
Lord assures, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah: "I shall deliver you from all sinful
reaction. Do not fear." There is no need to be worried, for the Lord Himself assures that He will care for
His devotee and save him from the reactions of sinful activities. Material bondage is a result of sinful
activity. Therefore, since the Lord assures that He will dissipate the results of fruitive material activities,
there is no need to be worried. This process of understanding one's position as a spirit soul and then
engaging oneself in devotional service is therefore the best. The entire Vedic program is based on this
principle, and one can understand it as recommended in the Vedas:
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports
of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23) One must accept the pure
devotee, the representative of God, as one's guru and then offer him all the respects one would offer the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the secret of success. For one who adopts this method, the
perfect process is revealed. In this verse, the words yair anjasa ratih indicate that by offering service and
surrendering to the spiritual master, one is elevated to devotional service, and by performing devotional
service one gradually becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of this
attachment to the Lord, one can understand the Lord. In other words, one can understand what the Lord's
position is, what our position is and what our relationship is. All this can be understood very easily by the
simple method of bhakti-yoga. As soon as one is situated on the platform of bhakti-yoga, the root cause of
one's suffering and material bondage is destroyed. This is clearly explained in the next verse, which gives
the secret of success.
