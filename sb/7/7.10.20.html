TRANSLATION
My dear Lord, everyone in this material world is under the modes of material nature, being influenced
by goodness, passion and ignorance. Everyone--from the greatest personality, Lord Brahma, down to the
small ant--works under the influence of these modes. Therefore everyone in this material world is
influenced by Your energy. The cause for which they work, the place where they work, the time when
they work, the matter due to which they work, the goal of life they have considered final, and the process
for obtaining this goal--all are nothing but manifestations of Your energy. Indeed, since the energy and
energetic are identical, all of them are but manifestations of You.
PURPORT
Whether one thinks himself protected by his parents, by the government, by some place or by some
other cause, everything is due to the various potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Everything
that is done, whether in the higher, middle or lower planetary systems, is due to the supervision or
control of the Supreme Lord. It is therefore said, karmana-daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul within the core of everyone's heart, gives inspirations for
action according to one's mentality. All of these mentalities are merely facilities given by Krsna to the
person acting. Bhagavad-gita therefore says, mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: everyone works
according to the inspiration given by the Supersoul. Because everyone has a different goal of life, everyone
acts differently, as guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The words yasmin yato yarhi yena ca yasya yasmat indicate that all activities, whatever they may be, are
but different features of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. All of them are created by the living entity
and fulfilled by the mercy of the Lord. Although all such activities are nondifferent from the Lord, the
Lord nonetheless directs, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: "Give up all other duties
and surrender unto Me." When we accept this direction from the Lord, we can actually become happy. As
long as we work according to our material senses we are in material life, but as soon as we act according
to the real, transcendental direction of the Lord, our position is spiritual. The activities of bhakti,
devotional service, are directly under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Naradapancaratra
states:
sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam
hrsikena hrsikesasevanam
bhaktir ucyate
When one gives up materially designated positions and works directly under the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, one's spiritual life is revived. This is described as svarupena avasthiti, being situated in one's
original constitutional position. This is the real description of mukti, or liberation from material bondage.
