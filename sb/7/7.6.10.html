<h2>Text</h2>
ko nv artha-trsnam visrjet
pranebhyo 'pi ya ipsitah
yam krinaty asubhih presthais
taskarah sevako vanik
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kah--who; nu--indeed; artha-trsnam--a strong desire to acquire money; visrjet--can give up;
pranebhyah--than life; api--indeed; yah--which; ipsitah--more desired; yam--which; krinati--tries to
acquire; asubhih--with his own life; presthaih--very dear; taskarah--a thief; sevakah--a professional
servant; vanik--a merchant.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Money is so dear that one conceives of money as being sweeter than honey. Therefore, who can give up
the desire to accumulate money, especially in household life? Thieves, professional servants [soldiers] and
merchants try to acquire money even by risking their very dear lives.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
How money can be dearer than life is indicated in this verse. Thieves may enter the house of a rich man
to steal money at the risk of their lives. Because of trespassing, they may be killed by guns or attacked by
watchdogs, but still they try to commit burglary. Why do they risk their lives? Only to get some money.
Similarly, a professional soldier is recruited into the army, and he accepts such service, with the risk of
dying on the battlefield, only for the sake of money. In the same way, merchants go from one country to
another on boats at the risk of their lives, or they dive into the water of the sea to collect pearls and
valuable gems. Thus it is practically proved--and everyone will admit--that money is sweeter than honey.
One may risk everything to acquire money, and this is especially true of rich men who are too attached to
household life. Formerly, of course, the members of the higher castes--the brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas (everyone but the sudras)--were trained in the guru-kula to adhere to a life of renunciation and
sense control by practicing brahmacarya and mystic yoga. Then they were allowed to enter household life.
There have consequently been many instances in which great kings and emperors have given up
household life. Although they were extremely opulent and were the masters of kingdoms, they could give
up all their possessions because they were trained early as brahmacaris. Prahlada Maharaja's advice is
therefore very appropriate:
kaumara acaret prajno
dharman bhagavatan iha
durlabham manusam janma
tad apy adhruvam arthadam
"One who is sufficiently intelligent should use the human form of body from the very beginning of life--
in other words, from the tender age of childhood--to practice the activities of devotional service, giving up
all other engagements. The human body is most rarely achieved, and although temporary like other
bodies, it is meaningful because in human life one can perform devotional service. Even a slight amount
of sincere devotional service can give one complete perfection." Human society should take advantage of
this instruction.
