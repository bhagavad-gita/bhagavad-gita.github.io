<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord Nrsimhadeva, O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and
not cared for by You cannot do anything for their betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although
perhaps temporarily beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot
protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering patient, and a boat on the ocean
cannot protect a drowning man.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Through parental care, through remedies for different kinds of disease, and through means of protection
on the water, in the air and on land, there is always an endeavor for relief from various kinds of suffering
in the material world, but none of them are guaranteed measures for protection. They may be beneficial
temporarily, but they afford no permanent benefit. Despite the presence of a father and mother, a child
cannot be protected from accidental death, disease and various other miseries. No one can help, including
the parents. Ultimately the shelter is the Lord, and one who takes shelter of the Lord is protected. This is
guaranteed. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O
son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes." Therefore, unless one is protected by the
mercy of the Lord, no remedial measure can act effectively. One should consequently depend fully on the
causeless mercy of the Lord. Although as a matter of routine duty one must of course accept other
remedial measures, no one can protect one who is neglected by the Supreme personality of Godhead. In
this material world, everyone is trying to counteract the onslaught of material nature, but everyone is
ultimately fully controlled by material nature. Therefore even though so-called philosophers and scientists
try to surmount the onslaught of material nature, they have not been able to do so. Krsna says in
Bhagavad-gita (13.9) that the real sufferings of the material world are four--janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi
(birth, death, old age and disease). In the history of the world, no one has been successful in conquering
these miseries imposed by material nature. prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah. Nature
(prakrti) is so strong that no one can overcome her stringent laws. So-called scientists, philosophers,
religionists and politicians should therefore conclude that they cannot offer facilities to the people in
general. They should make vigorous propaganda to awaken the populace and raise them to the platform
of Krsna consciousness. Our humble attempt to propagate the Krsna consciousness movement all over the
world is the only remedy that can bring about a peaceful and happy life. We can never be happy without
the mercy of the Supreme Lord (tvad-upeksitanam). If we keep displeasing our supreme father, we shall
never be happy within this material world, in either the upper or lower planetary systems.
