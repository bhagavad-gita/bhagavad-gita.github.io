<h2>Text</h2>
varta vicitra salinayayavara-
silonchanam
vipra-vrttis caturdheyam
sreyasi cottarottara
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
varta--the occupational means of livelihood for the vaisya (agriculture, cow protection, and trade);
vicitra--various types; salina--livelihood achieved without effort; yayavara--going to the field to beg for
some paddy; sila--picking up the grains left in the field by the proprietor; unchanam--picking up the
grains that have fallen from bags in shops; vipra-vrttih--the means of livelihood for the brahmanas;
caturdha--four different kinds; iyam--this; sreyasi--better; ca--also; uttara-uttara--the latter compared to
the former.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As an alternative, a brahmana may also take to the vaisya's occupational duty of agriculture, cow
protection, or trade. He may depend on that which he has received without begging, he may beg in the
paddy field every day, he may collect paddy left in a field by its proprietor, or he may collect food grains
left here and there in the shops of grain dealers. These are four means of livelihood that may also be
adopted by brahmanas. Among these four, each of them in succession is better than the one preceding it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A brahmana is sometimes offered land and cows in charity, and thus for his livelihood he may act in the
same way as a vaisya, by cultivating land, giving protection to cows and trading off his surpluses. A better
process, however, is to pick up grains from a field or from a dealer's shop without begging.
