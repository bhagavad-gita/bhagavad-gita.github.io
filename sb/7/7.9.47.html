<h2>Text</h2>
rupe ime sad-asati tava veda-srste
bijankurav iva na canyad arupakasya
yuktah samaksam ubhayatra vicaksante tvam
yogena vahnim iva darusu nanyatah syat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rupe--in the forms; ime--these two; sat-asati--the cause and the effect; tava--Your; veda-srste--explained
in the Vedas; bija-ankurau--the seed and the sprout; iva--like; na--never; ca--also; anyat--any other;
arupakasya--of You, who possess no material form; yuktah--those engaged in Your devotional service;
samaksam--before the very eyes; ubhayatra--in both ways (spiritually and materially); vicaksante--can
actually see; tvam--You; yogena--simply by the method of devotional service; vahnim--fire; iva--like;
darusu--in wood; na--not; anyatah--from any other means; syat--it is possible.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By authorized Vedic knowledge one can see that the forms of cause and effect in the cosmic
manifestation belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the cosmic manifestation is His energy.
Both cause and effect are nothing but energies of the Lord. Therefore, O my Lord, just as a wise man, by
considering cause and effect, can see how fire pervades wood, those engaged in devotional service
understand how You are both the cause and effect.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As described in previous verses, many so-called students of spiritual understanding follow the ten
different methods known as mauna-vrata-sruta-tapo-'dhyayana-sva-dharma-vyakhya-raho japasamadhayah.
These may be very attractive, but by following such methods, one cannot actually
understand the real cause and effect and the original cause of everything (janmady asya yatah). The
original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself (sarva-karana-karanam).
This original source of everything is Krsna, the supreme ruler. Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-anandavigrahah.
He has His eternal spiritual form. Indeed, He is the root of everything (bijam mam sarvabhutanam).
Whatever manifestations exist, their cause is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
cannot be understood by so-called silence or by any other hodgepodge method. The supreme cause can be
understood only by devotional service, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati). Elsewhere in
Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.21), the Supreme Godhead personally says, bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: one
can understand the original cause of all causes, the Supreme Person, only by devotional service, not by
show-bottle exhibitionism.
