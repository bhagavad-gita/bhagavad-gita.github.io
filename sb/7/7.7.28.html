TRANSLATION
The sons of the demons replied: Dear Prahlada, neither you nor we know any teacher or spiritual master
other than Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya. After all, we are children and they our controllers.
For you especially, who always remain within the palace, it is very difficult to associate with a great
personality. Dear friend, most gentle one, would you kindly explain how it was possible for you to hear
Narada? Kindly dispel our doubts in this regard.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled, "Prahlada Instructs His Demoniac Schoolmates."
Chapter Seven
What Prahlada Learned in the Womb
In this chapter, to dissipate the doubts of his class friends, the sons of the demons, Prahlada Maharaja
states how, within the womb of his mother, he had heard from the mouth of Narada Muni, who had
instructed him in bhagavata-dharma.
When Hiranyakasipu left his kingdom and went to the mountain known as Mandaracala to execute
severe austerities, all the demons scattered. Hiranyakasipu's wife, Kayadhu, was pregnant at that time, and
the demigods, mistakenly thinking that she carried another demon in her womb, arrested her. Their plan
was that as soon as the child took birth they would kill him. While they were taking Kayadhu to the
heavenly planets, they met Narada Muni, who stopped them from taking her away and took her to his
asrama until Hiranyakasipu's return. In Narada Muni's asrama, Kayadhu prayed for the protection of the
baby in her womb, and Narada Muni reassured her and gave her instructions on spiritual knowledge.
Taking advantage of those instructions, Prahlada Maharaja, although a small baby within the womb,
listened very carefully. The spirit soul is always apart from the material body. There is no change in the
spiritual form of the living entity. Any person above the bodily conception of life is pure and can receive
transcendental knowledge. This transcendental knowledge is devotional service, and Prahlada Maharaja,
while living in the womb of his mother, received instructions in devotional service from Narada Muni.
Any person engaged in the service of the Lord through the instructions of a bona fide spiritual master is
immediately liberated, and being free from the clutches of maya, he is relieved of all ignorance and
material desires. The duty of everyone is to take shelter of the Supreme Lord and thus become free from
all material desires. Regardless of the material condition in which one is situated, one can achieve this
perfection. Devotional service is not dependent on the material activities of austerity, penance, mystic
yoga or piety. Even without such assets, one can achieve devotional service through the mercy of a pure
devotee.
