<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; bhavadbhih--by your good selves; kartavyam--to be done; karmanam--of all material
activities; tri-guna-atmanam--conditioned by the three modes of material nature; bija-nirharanam--
burning of the seed; yogah--the process by which one can be linked with the Supreme; pravaha--of the
continuous current in the form of wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep; uparamah--the cessation;
dhiyah--of the intelligence.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, my dear friends, O sons of the demons, your duty is to take to Krsna consciousness, which
can burn the seed of fruitive activities artificially created by the modes of material nature and stop the
flow of the intelligence in wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. In other words, when one takes to Krsna
consciousness, his ignorance is immediately dissipated.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
"One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once
transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman." By the practice of
bhakti-yoga, one immediately comes to the spiritual platform, transcendental to the actions and reactions
of the three modes of material nature. The root of ignorance is material consciousness, which must be
killed by spiritual consciousness, or Krsna consciousness. The word bija-nirharanam refers to burning the
root cause of material life to ashes. In the Medini dictionary, yoga is explained by its result: yoge
'purvartha-sampraptau sangati-dhyana-yuktisu. When one is put into an awkward position because of
ignorance, the process by which one can be freed from this entanglement is called yoga. This is also called
liberation. Muktir hitvanyatha-rupam svarupena vyavasthitih. Mukti means giving up one's position in
ignorance or illusion, by which one thinks in a way contrary to his constitutional position. Returning to
one's constitutional position is called mukti, and the process by which one does this is called yoga. Thus
yoga is above karma, jnana and sankhya. Indeed, yoga is the ultimate goal of life. Krsna therefore advised
Arjuna to become a yogi (tasmad yogi bhavarjuna). Lord Krsna further advised in Bhagavad-gita that the
first-class yogi is he who has come to the platform of devotional service.
yoginam api sarvesam
mad-gatenantaratmana
sraddhavan bhajate yo mam
sa me yuktatamo matah
"Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving
service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all." (Bg. 6.47) Thus one who
always thinks of Krsna within the core of his heart is the best yogi. By practicing this best of all yoga
systems, one is liberated from the material condition.
