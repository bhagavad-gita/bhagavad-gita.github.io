jaghanyo nottamam vrttim
anapadi bhajen narah
rte rajanyam apatsu
sarvesam api sarvasah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jaghanyah--low (person); na--not; uttamam--high; vrttim--means of livelihood; anapadi--when there is
no social upheaval; bhajet--may accept; narah--a man; rte--except; rajanyam--the profession of the
ksatriyas; apatsu--at times of emergency; sarvesam--of everyone in every status of life; api--certainly;
sarvasah--all professions or occupational duties.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Except in a time of emergency, lower persons should not accept the occupational duties of those who
are higher. When there is such an emergency, of course, everyone but the ksatriya may accept the means
of livelihood of others.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The occupational duty of a brahmana should not be accepted by persons in lower social orders,
especially vaisyas and sudras. For example, an occupational duty of the brahmana is to teach Vedic
knowledge, but unless there is an emergency, this professional duty should not be accepted by the
ksatriyas, vaisyas or sudras. Even a ksatriya cannot accept the duties of a brahmana unless there is an
emergency, and then even if he does so he should not accept charity from anyone else. Sometimes
brahmanas protest against our Krsna consciousness movement for creating brahmanas from Europeans,
or, in other words, from mlecchas and yavanas. This movement, however, is here supported in Srimad-
Bhagavatam. At the present moment, society is in a chaotic condition, and everyone has given up the
cultivation of spiritual life, which is especially meant for the brahmanas. Because spiritual culture has
been stopped all over the world, there is now an emergency, and therefore it is now time to train those
who are considered lower and condemned, so that they may become brahmanas and take up the work of
spiritual progress. The spiritual progress of human society has been stopped, and this should be
considered an emergency. Here is solid support from Narada Muni of the movement known as Krsna
consciousness.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In time of emergency, one may accept any of the various types of professions known as rta, amrta, mrta,
pramrta and satyanrta, but one should not at any time accept the profession of a dog. The profession of
unchasila, collecting grains from the field, is called rta. Collecting without begging is called amrta,
begging grains is called mrta, tilling the ground is called pramrta, and trade is called satyanrta. Engaging
in the service of low-grade persons, however, is called sva-vrtti, the profession of the dogs. Specifically,
brahmanas and ksatriyas should not engage in the low and abominable service of sudras. Brahmanas
should be well acquainted with all the Vedic knowledge, and ksatriyas should be well acquainted with the
worship of demigods.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four
divisions of human society were created by the Supreme Lord according to the three modes of material
nature and the work ascribed to them. Formerly, the principle of dividing human society into four
sections--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--was strictly followed, but because of gradual neglect of
the varnasrama principles, varna-sankara population developed, and the entire institution has now been
lost. In this age of Kali, practically everyone is a sudra (kalau sudra-sambhavah), and finding anyone who
is a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya is very difficult. Although the Krsna consciousness movement is a
movement of brahmanas and Vaisnavas, it is trying to reestablish the divine varnasrama institution, for
without this division of society there cannot be peace and prosperity anywhere.
