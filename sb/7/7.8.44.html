<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The inhabitants of Pitrloka prayed: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Lord Nrsimhadeva, the
maintainer of the religious principles of the universe. He has killed Hiranyakasipu, the demon who by
force enjoyed all the offerings of the sraddha ceremonies performed by our sons and grandsons on the
anniversaries of our death and who drank the water with sesame seeds offered in holy places of
pilgrimage. By killing this demon, O Lord, You have taken back all this stolen property from his abdomen
by piercing it with Your nails. We therefore wish to offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is the duty of all householders to offer food grains to all their departed forefathers, but during the
time of Hiranyakasipu this process was stopped; no one would offer sraddha oblations of food grains to
the forefathers with great respect. Thus when there is a demoniac rule, everything concerning the Vedic
principles is turned upside down, all the religious ceremonies of yajna are stopped, the resources meant to
be spent for yajna are taken away by the demoniac government, everything becomes chaotic, and
consequently the entire world becomes hell itself. When the demons are killed by the presence of
Nrsimhadeva, everyone feels comfortable, irrespective of the planet upon which he lives.
