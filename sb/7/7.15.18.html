<h2>Text</h2>
santustah kena va rajan
na vartetapi varina
aupasthya-jaihvya-karpanyad
grha-palayate janah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
santustah--a person who is always self-satisfied; kena--why; va--or; rajan--O King; na--not; varteta--
should live (happily); api--even; varina--by drinking water; aupasthya--due to the genitals; jaihvya--and
the tongue; karpanyat--because of a wretched or miserly condition; grha-palayate--he becomes exactly like
a household dog; janah--such a person.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, a self-satisfied person can be happy even with only drinking water. However, one who is
driven by the senses, especially by the tongue and genitals, must accept the position of a household dog to
satisfy his senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the sastras, a brahmana, or a cultured person in Krsna consciousness, will not enter
anyone's service to maintain body and soul together, and especially not for satisfaction of the senses. A
true brahmana is always satisfied. Even if he has nothing to eat, he can drink a little water and be satisfied.
This is only a matter of practice. Unfortunately, however, no one is educated in how to be satisfied in selfrealization.
As explained above, a devotee is always satisfied because he feels the presence of the
Supersoul within his heart and thinks of Him twenty-four hours a day. That is real satisfaction. A devotee
is never driven by the dictations of the tongue and genitals, and thus he is never victimized by the laws of
material nature.
