<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
katamo 'pi na venah syat
pancanam purusam prati
tasmat kenapy upayena
manah krsne nivesayet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
katamah api--anyone; na--not; venah--the atheistic King Vena; syat--would adopt; pancanam--of the five
(previously mentioned); purusam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; prati--in regard to; tasmat--
therefore; kenapi--by any; upayena--means; manah--the mind; krsne--in Krsna; nivesayet--one should fix.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Somehow or other, one must consider the form of Krsna very seriously. Then, by one of the five
different processes mentioned above, one can return home, back to Godhead. Atheists like King Vena,
however, being unable to think of Krsna's form in any of these five ways, cannot attain salvation.
Therefore, one must somehow think of Krsna, whether in a friendly way or inimically.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Impersonalists and atheists always try to circumvent the form of Krsna. Great politicians and
philosophers of the modern age even try to banish Krsna from Bhagavad-gita. Consequently, for them
there is no salvation. But Krsna's enemies think, "Here is Krsna, my enemy. I have to kill Him." They
think of Krsna in His actual form, and thus they attain salvation. Devotees, therefore, who constantly
think of Krsna's form, are certainly liberated. The only business of the Mayavadi atheists is to make Krsna
formless, and consequently, because of this severe offense at the lotus feet of Krsna, they cannot expect
salvation. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection: tena sisupaladi-bhinnah pratikulabhavam
didhisur yena iva narakam yatiti bhavah. Except for Sisupala, those who go against the regulative
principles cannot attain salvation and are surely destined for hellish life. The regulative principle is that
one must always think of Krsna, whether as a friend or enemy.
