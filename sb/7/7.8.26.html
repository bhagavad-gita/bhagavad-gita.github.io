<h2>Text</h2>
sa tasya hastotkalitas tadasuro
vikridato yadvad ahir garutmatah
asadhv amanyanta hrtaukaso 'mara
ghana-cchada bharata sarva-dhisnya-pah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Hiranyakasipu); tasya--of Him (Lord Nrsimhadeva); hasta--from the hands; utkalitah--slipped;
tada--at that time; asurah--the King of the demons, Hiranyakasipu; vikridatah--playing; yadvat--exactly
like; ahih--a snake; garutmatah--of Garuda; asadhu--not very good; amanyanta--considered; hrta-okasah--
whose abodes were taken by Hiranyakasipu; amarah--the demigods; ghana-cchadah--situated behind a
cover of clouds; bharata--O great son of Bharata; sarva-dhisnya-pah--the rulers of the heavenly planets.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Yudhisthira, O great son of Bharata, when Lord Nrsimhadeva gave Hiranyakasipu a chance to slip
from His hand, just as Garuda sometimes plays with a snake and lets it slip from his mouth, the demigods,
who had lost their abodes and who were hiding behind the clouds for fear of the demon, did not consider
that incident very good. Indeed, they were perturbed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Hiranyakasipu was in the process of being killed by Lord Nrsimhadeva, the Lord gave the demon
a chance to slip from His clutches. This incident was not very much appreciated by the demigods, for they
were greatly afraid of Hiranyakasipu. They knew that if somehow or other Hiranyakasipu escaped from
Nrsimhadeva's hands and saw that the demigods were looking forward to his death with great pleasure, he
would take great revenge upon them. Therefore they were very much afraid.
