<h2>Translation</h2>
I offer my obeisances to the original personality within this universe, Lord Brahma, who is cognizant
and who can apply his mind and realized intelligence in creating this cosmic manifestation. It is because
of his activities that everything within the universe is visible. He is therefore the cause of all
manifestations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedanta-sutra begins by declaring that the Absolute Person is the original source of all creation
(janmady asya yatah). One may ask whether Lord Brahma is the Supreme Absolute Person. No, the
Supreme Absolute Person is Krsna. Brahma receives his mind, intelligence, materials and everything else
from Krsna, and then he becomes the secondary creator, the engineer of this universe. In this regard we
may note that the creation does not take place accidentally, because of the explosion of a chunk. Such
nonsensical theories are not accepted by Vedic students. The first created living being is Brahma, who is
endowed with perfect knowledge and intelligence by the Lord. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, tene
brahma hrda ya adi-kavaye: although Brahma is the first created being, he is not independent, for he
receives help from the Supreme Personality of Godhead through his heart. There is no one but Brahma at
the time of creation, and therefore he receives his intelligence directly from the Lord through the heart.
This has been discussed in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Lord Brahma is described in this verse as the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, and this applies
to his position in the material world. There are many, many such controllers, all of whom are created by
the Supreme Lord, Visnu. This is illustrated by an incident described in Caitanya-caritamrta. When the
Brahma of this particular universe was invited by Krsna to Dvaraka, he thought that he was the only
Brahma. Therefore when Krsna inquired from His servant which Brahma was at the door to visit, Lord
Brahma was surprised. He replied that of course Lord Brahma, the father of the four Kumaras, was waiting
at the door. Later, Lord Brahma asked Krsna why He had inquired which Brahma had come. He was then
informed that there are millions of other Brahmas because there are millions of universes. Krsna then
called all the Brahmas, who immediately came to visit Him. The catur-mukha Brahma, the four-headed
Brahma of this universe, thought himself a very insignificant creature in the presence of so many Brahmas
with so many heads. Thus although there is a Brahma who is the engineer of each universe, Krsna is the
original source of all of them.
