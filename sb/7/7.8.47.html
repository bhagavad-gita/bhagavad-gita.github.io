<h2>Text</h2>
sri-naga ucuh
yena papena ratnani
stri-ratnani hrtani nah
tad-vaksah-patanenasam
dattananda namo 'stu te
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-nagah ucuh--the inhabitants of Nagaloka, who look like serpents, said; yena--by which person;
papena--the most sinful (Hiranyakasipu); ratnani--the jewels on our heads; stri-ratnani--beautiful wives;
hrtani--taken away; nah--our; tat--his; vaksah-patanena--by the piercing of the chest; asam--of all the
women (who were kidnapped); datta-ananda--O Lord, You are the source of the pleasure; namah--our
respectful obeisances; astu--let there be; te--unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The inhabitants of Nagaloka said: The most sinful Hiranyakasipu took away all the jewels on our hoods
and all our beautiful wives. Now, since his chest has been pierced by Your nails, You are the source of all
pleasure to our wives. Thus we together offer our respectful obeisances unto You.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
No one is peaceful if his wealth and wife are forcibly taken away. All the inhabitants of Nagaloka, which
is situated below the earthly planetary system, were in great anxiety because their wealth had been stolen
and their wives kidnapped by Hiranyakasipu. Now, Hiranyakasipu having been killed, their wealth and
wives were returned, and their wives felt satisfied. The inhabitants of various lokas, or planets, offered
their respectful obeisances unto the Lord because they were relieved by the death of Hiranyakasipu.
Disturbances similar to those created by Hiranyakasipu are now taking place all over the world because of
demoniac governments. As stated in the Twelfth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the men of the
governments of Kali-yuga will be no better than rogues and plunderers. Thus the populace will be
harassed on one side by scarcity of food and on another by heavy taxation by the government. In other
words, the people in most parts of the world in this age are harassed by the ruling principles of
Hiranyakasipu.
