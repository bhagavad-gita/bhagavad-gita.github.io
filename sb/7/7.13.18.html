<h2>Text</h2>
na te sayanasya nirudyamasya
brahman nu hartho yata eva bhogah
abhogino 'yam tava vipra dehah
piva yatas tad vada nah ksamam cet
<p></p>

person; nu--indeed; ha--it is evident; arthah--money; yatah--from which; eva--indeed; bhogah--sense

ksamam--excuse; cet--if I have asked an impudent question.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O brahmana, fully in knowledge of transcendence, you have nothing to do, and therefore you are lying
down. It is also understood that you have no money for sense enjoyment. How then has your body
become so fat? Under the circumstances, if you do not consider my question impudent, kindly explain
how this has happened.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally those engaged in spiritual advancement take food only once, either in the afternoon or in the
evening. If one takes food only once, naturally he does not become fat. The learned sage, however, was
quite fat, and therefore Prahlada Maharaja was very much surprised. Because of being experienced in selfrealization,
a transcendentalist certainly becomes bright-faced. And one who is advanced in selfrealization
must be considered to possess the body of a brahmana. Because the bright-faced saintly person
was lying down and not working and yet was quite fat, Prahlada Maharaja was puzzled and wanted to
question him about this.
