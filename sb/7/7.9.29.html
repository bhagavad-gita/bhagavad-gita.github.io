TRANSLATION
As a snake captures a mouse or Garuda captures a very venomous snake, Lord Nrsimhadeva captured
Hiranyakasipu, who could not be pierced even by the thunderbolt of King Indra. As Hiranyakasipu moved
his limbs here, there and all around, very much afflicted at being captured, Lord Nrsimhadeva placed the
demon on His lap, supporting him with His thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the Lord very
easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of His hand.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu had received from Lord Brahma the benediction that he would not die on the land or in
the sky. Therefore, to keep the promise of Lord Brahma intact, Nrsimhadeva placed Hiranyakasipu's body
on His lap, which was neither land nor sky. Hiranyakasipu had received the benediction that he would
not die either during the day or at night. Therefore, to keep this promise of Brahma, the Lord killed
Hiranyakasipu in the evening, which is the end of day and the beginning of night but is neither day nor
night. Hiranyakasipu had taken a benediction from Lord Brahma that he would not die from any weapon
or be killed by any person, dead or alive. Therefore, just to keep the word of Lord Brahma, Lord
Nrsimhadeva pierced Hiranyakasipu's body with His nails, which were not weapons and were neither
living nor dead. Indeed, the nails can be called dead, but at the same time they can be said to be alive. To
keep intact all of Lord Brahma's benedictions, Lord Nrsimhadeva paradoxically but very easily killed the
great demon Hiranyakasipu.
