<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because of my association with material desires, one
after another, I was gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes, following the general populace. But
Your servant Narada Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple and instructed me how to achieve this
transcendental position. Therefore, my first duty is to serve him. Mow could I leave his service?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As will be seen in later verses, even though Prahlada Maharaja was directly offered all the benedictions
he might have desired, he refused to accept such offerings from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. On
the contrary, he asked the Lord to engage him in the service of His servant Narada Muni. This is the
symptom of a pure devotee. One should serve the spiritual master first. It is not that one should bypass
the spiritual master and desire to serve the Supreme Lord. This is not the principle for a Vaisnava.
Narottama dasa Thakura says:
tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa
janame janame haya, ei abhilasa
One should not be anxious to offer direct service to the Lord. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised that one
become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasadasanudasah).
This is the process for approaching the Supreme Lord. The first service should be rendered
to the spiritual master so that by his mercy one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead to
render service. While teaching Rupa Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, guru-krsna-prasade paya
bhakti-lata-bija: one can achieve the seed of devotional service by the mercy of the guru, the spiritual
master, and then by the mercy of Krsna. This is the secret of success. First one should try to please the
spiritual master, and then one should attempt to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura also says, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado. One should not attempt to please the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by concoction. One must first be prepared to serve the spiritual master,
and when one is qualified he is automatically offered the platform of direct service to the Lord. Therefore
Prahlada Maharaja proposed that he engage in the service of Narada Muni. He never proposed that he
engage directly in the service of the Lord. This is the right conclusion. Therefore he said, so 'ham katham
nu visrje tava bhrtya-sevam: "How can I give up the service of my spiritual master, who has favored me in
such a way that I am now able to see You face to face?" Prahlada Maharaja prayed to the Lord that he
might continue to engage in the service of his spiritual master, Narada Muni.
