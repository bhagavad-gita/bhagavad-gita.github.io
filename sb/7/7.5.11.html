<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja replied: Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, whose external energy has created the distinctions of "my friend" and "my enemy" by deluding
the intelligence of men. Indeed, I am now actually experiencing this, although I have previously heard of
it from authoritative sources.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):
vidya-vinaya-sampanne
brahmane gavi hastini
suni caiva svapake ca
panditah sama-darsinah
"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a
cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste]." panditah, those who are actually learned--the
equipoised, advanced devotees who have full knowledge of everything--do not see any living entity as an
enemy or friend. Instead, with broader vision, they see that everyone is part of Krsna, as confirmed by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu (jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa'). Every living entity, being part of the
Supreme Lord, is meant to serve the Lord, just as every part of the body is meant to serve the whole body.
As servants of the Supreme Lord, all living entities are one, but a Vaisnava, because of his natural
humility, addresses every other living entity as prabhu. A Vaisnava sees other servants to be so advanced
that he has much to learn from them. Thus he accepts all other devotees of the Lord as prabhus, masters.
Although everyone is a servant of the Lord, one Vaisnava servant, because of humility, sees another
servant as his master. Understanding of the master begins from understanding of the spiritual master.
yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado
yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto 'pi
"By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of Krsna. Without the grace of the
spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement."
saksad-dharitvena samasta-sastrair
uktas tatha bhavyata eva sadbhih
kintu prabhor yah priya eva tasya
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam
"The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential
servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities.
Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a bona fide
representative of Sri Hari [Krsna]." The spiritual master, the servant of God, is engaged in the most
confidential service of the Lord, namely delivering all the conditioned souls from the clutches of maya, in
which one thinks, "This person is my enemy, and that one is my friend." Actually the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the friend of all living entities, and all living entities are eternal servants of the
Supreme Lord. Oneness is possible through this understanding, not through artificially thinking that
every one of us is God or equal to God. The true understanding is that God is the supreme master and
that all of us are servants of the Supreme Lord and are therefore on the same platform. This had already
been taught to Prahlada Maharaja by his spiritual master, Narada, but Prahlada was nonetheless surprised
by how a bewildered soul thinks one person his enemy and another his friend.
As long as one adheres to the philosophy of duality, thinking one person a friend and another an enemy,
he should be understood to be in the clutches of maya. The Mayavadi philosopher who thinks that all
living entities are God and are therefore one is also mistaken. No one is equal to God. The servant cannot
be equal to the master. According to the Vaisnava philosophy, the master is one, and the servants are also
one, but the distinction between the master and servant must continue even in the liberated stage. In the
conditioned stage we think that some living beings are our friends whereas others are enemies, and thus
we are in duality. In the liberated stage, however, the conception is that God is the master and that all
living entities, being servants of God, are one.
