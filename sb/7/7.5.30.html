<h2>Text</h2>
sri-prahrada uvaca
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho 'bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-prahradah uvaca--Prahlada Maharaja said; matih--inclination; na--never; krsne--unto Lord Krsna;
paratah--from the instructions of others; svatah--from their own understanding; va--either; mithah--from
combined effort; abhipadyeta--is developed; grha-vratanam--of persons too addicted to the materialistic,
bodily conception of life; adanta--uncontrolled; gobhih--by the senses; visatam--entering; tamisram--
hellish life; punah--again; punah--again; carvita--things already chewed; carvananam--who are chewing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Prahlada Maharaja replied: Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic
life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already been chewed.
Their inclinations toward Krsna are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own
efforts, or by a combination of both.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the words matir na krsne refer to devotional service rendered to Krsna. So-called
politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers who read Bhagavad-gita try to twist some meaning from it
to suit their material purposes, but their misunderstandings of Krsna will not yield them any profit.
Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are interested in using Bhagavad-gita as a vehicle for
adjusting things materially, for them constant thought of Krsna, or Krsna consciousness, is impossible
(matir na krsne). As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: only through devotional
service can one understand Krsna as He is. The so-called politicians and scholars think of Krsna as
fictitious. The politician says that his Krsna is different from the Krsna depicted in Bhagavad-gita. Even
though he accepts Krsna and Rama as the Supreme he thinks of Rama and Krsna as impersonal because he
has no idea of service to Krsna. Thus his only business is punah punas carvita-carvananam--chewing the
chewed again and again. The aim of such politicians and academic scholars is to enjoy this material world
with their bodily senses. Therefore it is clearly stated here that those who are grha-vrata, whose only aim
is to live comfortably with the body in the material world, cannot understand Krsna. The two expressions
grha-vrata and carvita-carvananam indicate that a materialistic person tries to enjoy sense gratification in
different bodily forms, life after life, but is still unsatisfied. In the name of personalism, this ism or that
ism, such persons always remain attached to the materialistic way of life. As stated in Bhagavad-gita
(2.44):
bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam
tayapahrta-cetasam
vyavasayatmika buddhih
samadhau na vidhiyate
"In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are
bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does
not take place." Those who are attached to material enjoyment cannot be fixed in devotional service to the
Lord. They cannot understand Bhagavan, Krsna, or His instruction, Bhagavad-gita. Adanta-gobhir visatam
tamisram: their path actually leads toward hellish life.
As confirmed by Rsabhadeva, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh: one must try to understand Krsna
by serving a devotee. The word mahat refers to a devotee.
mahatmanas tu mam partha
daivim prakrtim asritah
bhajanty ananya-manaso
jnatva bhutadim avyayam
"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine
nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, original and inexhaustible." (Bg. 9.13) A mahatma is one who is constantly engaged in
devotional service, twenty-four hours a day. As explained in the following verses, unless one adheres to
such a great personality, one cannot understand Krsna. Hiranyakasipu wanted to know where Prahlada
had gotten this Krsna consciousness. Who had taught him? Prahlada sarcastically replied, "My dear
father, persons like you never understand Krsna. One can understand Krsna only by serving a mahat, a
great soul. Those who try to adjust material conditions are said to be chewing the chewed. No one has
been able to adjust material conditions, but life after life, generation after generation, people try and
repeatedly fail. Unless one is properly trained by a mahat--a mahatma, or unalloyed devotee of the Lord--
there is no possibility of one's understanding Krsna and His devotional service."
