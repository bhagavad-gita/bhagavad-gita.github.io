TRANSLATION
The real problem of life is the repetition of birth and death, which is like a wheel rolling repeatedly up
and down. This wheel, however, completely stops when one is in touch with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In other words, by the transcendental bliss realized from constant engagement in devotional
service, one is completely liberated from material existence. All learned men know this. Therefore, my
dear friends, O sons of the asuras, immediately begin meditating upon and worshiping the Supersoul
within everyone's heart.
PURPORT
Generally it is understood that by merging into the existence of Brahman, the impersonal feature of the
Absolute Truth, one becomes completely happy. The words brahma-nirvana refer to connecting with the
Absolute Truth, who is realized in three features: brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate. One feels
brahma-sukha, spiritual happiness, by merging into the impersonal Brahman because the brahmajyoti is
the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti. Yasya
prabha, the impersonal Brahman, consists of the rays of Krsna's transcendental body. Therefore whatever
transcendental bliss one feels from merging in Brahman is due to contact with Krsna. Contact with Krsna
is perfect brahma-sukha. When the mind is in touch with the impersonal Brahman one becomes satisfied,
but one must advance further to render service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for one's
remaining merged in the Brahman effulgence is not always assured. As it is said, aruhya krcchrena param
padam tatah patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah: one may merge in the Brahman feature of the
Absolute Truth, but there is a chance that one may fall because of not being acquainted with Adhoksaja,
or Vasudeva. Of course, such brahma-sukha undoubtedly eliminates material happiness, but when one
advances through impersonal Brahman and localized Paramatma to approach the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in relationship with Him as a servant, friend, parent or conjugal lover, one's happiness becomes
all-pervading. Then one automatically feels transcendental bliss, just as one becomes happy seeing the
shining of the moon. One acquires natural happiness upon seeing the moon, but when one can see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, one's transcendental happiness increases hundreds and thousands of
times. As soon as one is very intimately connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one surely
becomes free from all material contamination. Ya nirvrtis tanu-bhrtam. This cessation of all material
happiness is called nirvrti or nirvana. Srila Rupa Gosvami says in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.38):
brahmanando bhaved esa
cet parardha-guni-krtah
naiti bhakti-sukhambhodheh
paramanu-tulam api
"If brahmananda, the bliss of merging in the Brahman effulgence, were multiplied one hundred trillion
times, it would still not equal even an atomic fragment of the ocean of transcendental bliss felt in
devotional service."
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that
state he attains pure devotional service unto the Lord." (Bg. 18.54) If one advances further from the
brahma-nirvana platform, one enters the stage of devotional service (mad-bhaktim labhate param). The
word adhoksajalambham refers to keeping the mind always engaged in the Absolute Truth, who is beyond
the mind and material speculation. Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh. This is the result of Deity
worship. By constantly engaging in the service of the Lord and thinking of His lotus feet, one is
automatically freed from all material contamination. Thus the word brahma-nirvana-sukham indicates
that when one is in touch with the Absolute Truth, material sense gratification is completely nullified.
