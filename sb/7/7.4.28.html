<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
nirvairaya prasantaya
sva-sutaya mahatmane
prahradaya yada druhyed
dhanisye 'pi varorjitam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nirvairaya--who is without enemies; prasantaya--very sober and peaceful; sva-sutaya--unto his own son;
maha-atmane--who is a great devotee; prahradaya--Prahlada Maharaja; yada--when; druhyet--will commit
violence; hanisye--I shall kill; api--although; vara-urjitam--blessed by the boons of Lord Brahma.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Hiranyakasipu teases the great devotee Prahlada, his own son, who is peaceful and sober and who
has no enemy, I shall kill Hiranyakasipu immediately, despite the benedictions of Brahma.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vaisnava, is the most severe. An offense at the
lotus feet of a Vaisnava is so disastrous that Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has compared it to a mad elephant
that enters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees. If one is an offender at
the lotus feet of a brahmana or Vaisnava, his offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should
therefore very carefully guard against committing vaisnava-aparadha, or offenses at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava. Here the Lord clearly says that although Hiranyakasipu had received benedictions from Lord
Brahma, these benedictions would be null and void as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of
Prahlada Maharaja, his own son. A Vaisnava like Prahlada Maharaja is described herein as nirvaira, having
no enemies. Elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.21) it is said, ajata-satravah santah sadhavah sadhubhusanah:
a devotee has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics
are sublime. A devotee does not create enmity with anyone, but if someone becomes his enemy, that
person will be vanquished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, despite whatever benedictions he may
have received from other sources. Hiranyakasipu was certainly enjoying the fruitful results of his
austerities, but here the Lord says that as soon as he committed an offense at the lotus feet of Prahlada
Maharaja he would be ruined. One's longevity, opulence, beauty, education and whatever else one may
possess as a result of pious activities cannot protect one if one commits an offense at the lotus feet of a
Vaisnava. Despite whatever one possesses, if one offends the lotus feet of a Vaisnava he will be
vanquished.
