<h2>Translation</h2>
O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the
association of demons as a result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of
life within this material world. When will that moment come when You will call me to the shelter of Your
lotus feet, which are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Being in the material world is certainly miserable, but certainly when one is put into the association of
asuras, or atheistic men, it is intolerably so. One may ask why the living entity is put into the material
world. Indeed, sometimes foolish people deride the Lord for having put them here. Actually, everyone is
put into conditional life according to his karma. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja, representing all the other
conditioned souls, admits that he was put into life among the asuras because of the results of his karma.
The Lord is known as krpana-vatsala because He is extremely kind to the conditioned souls. As stated in
Bhagavad-gita, therefore, the Lord appears whenever there are discrepancies in the execution of religious
principles (yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata. .. tadatmanam srjamy aham). The Lord is
extremely anxious to deliver the conditioned souls, and therefore He instructs all of us to return home,
back to Godhead (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja). Thus Prahlada Maharaja expected
that the Lord, by His kindness, would call him again to the shelter of His lotus feet. In other words,
everyone should be eager to return home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord
and thus being fully trained in Krsna consciousness.
