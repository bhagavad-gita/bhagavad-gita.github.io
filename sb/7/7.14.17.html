<h2>Text</h2>
na hy agni-mukhato 'yam vai
bhagavan sarva-yajna-bhuk
ijyeta havisa rajan
yatha vipra-mukhe hutaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; hi--indeed; agni--fire; mukhatah--from the mouth or the flames; ayam--this; vai--certainly;
bhagavan--Lord Sri Krsna; sarva-yajna-bhuk--the enjoyer of the results of all kinds of sacrifices; ijyeta--is
worshiped; havisa--by offering of clarified butter; rajan--O King; yatha--as much as; vipra-mukhe--
through the mouth of a brahmana; hutaih--by offering him first-class food.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, is the enjoyer of sacrificial offerings. Yet although His
Lordship eats the oblations offered in the fire, my dear King, He is still more satisfied when nice food
made of grains and ghee is offered to Him through the mouths of qualified brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah: all fruitive
activities should be performed for sacrifice, which should be directed toward pleasing Krsna. As stated
elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: He is the Supreme
Lord and enjoyer of everything. However, although sacrifice may be offered to please Krsna, He is more
pleased when grains and ghee, instead of being offered in the fire, are prepared as prasada and distributed,
first to the brahmanas and then to others. This system pleases Krsna more than anything else.
Furthermore, at the present time there is very little chance to offer sacrifices by pouring oblations of food
grains and ghee into the fire. Especially in India, there is practically no ghee; for everything that should be
done with ghee, people use a certain type of oil preparation. Oil, however, is never recommended for
offering in a sacrificial fire. In Kali-yuga, the available quantity of food grains and ghee is gradually
diminishing, and people are embarrassed that they cannot produce sufficient ghee and food grains. Under
the circumstances, the sastras enjoin, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: in this age, those
who are intellectual offer yajna, or perform sacrifices, through the sankirtana movement. Everyone should
join the sankirtana movement, offering to the fire of this movement the oblations of his knowledge and
riches. In our sankirtana movement, or Hare Krsna movement, we offer sumptuous prasada to the Deity
and later distribute the same prasada to the brahmanas, the Vaisnavas and then to the people in general.
Krsna's prasada is offered to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas, and the prasada of the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas is offered to the general populace. This kind of sacrifice--chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra
and distribution of prasada--is the most perfect and bona fide way of offering sacrifice for the pleasure of
Yajna, or Visnu.
