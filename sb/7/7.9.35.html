<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma, who is celebrated as atma-yoni, having been born without a mother, was struck with
wonder. Thus he took shelter of the lotus flower, and when he had been purified after undergoing severe
austerities for many hundreds of years, he could see that the cause of all causes, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, was spread throughout his own body and senses, just as aroma, although very subtle, is
perceived in the earth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the statement of self-realization aham brahmasmi, which is interpreted by the Mayavada
philosophy to mean "I am the Supreme Lord," is explained. The Supreme Lord is the original seed of
everything (janmady asya yatah. aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate). Thus the Supreme
Lord extends everywhere, even throughout our bodies, because our bodies are made of material energy,
which is the Lord's separated energy. One should realize that since the Supreme Lord spreads throughout
one's body and since the individual soul is a part of the Supreme Lord, everything is Brahman (sarvam
khalv idam brahma). This realization was achieved by Lord Brahma after he was purified, and it is
possible for everyone. When one is completely in knowledge of aham brahmasmi, he thinks, "I am part of
the Supreme Lord, my body is made of His material energy, and therefore I have no separate existence. Yet
although the Supreme Lord is spread everywhere, He is different from me." This is the philosophy of
acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. An example given in this regard is that of the aroma within the earth. In the
earth there are aromas and colors, but one cannot see them. Actually we find that when flowers grow from
the earth, they appear with different colors and aromas, which they have certainly gathered from the
earth, although in the earth we cannot see them. Similarly, the Supreme Lord, by His different energies,
spreads throughout one's body and soul, although we cannot see Him. An intelligent man, however, can
see the Supreme Lord existing everywhere. Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: the Lord is within
the universe and within the atom by His different energies. This is the real vision of the Supreme Lord for
the intelligent man. Brahma, the first created being, became the most intelligent person by his tapasya,
austerity, and thus he came to this realization. We must therefore take all knowledge from Brahma, who
became perfect by his tapasya.
