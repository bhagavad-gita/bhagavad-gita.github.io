TRANSLATION
A pretentious religious system manufactured by one who willfully neglects the prescribed duties of his
order of life is called abhasa [a dim reflection or false similarity]. But if one performs the prescribed duties
for his particular asrama or varna, why are they not sufficient to mitigate all material distresses?
PURPORT
It is indicated here that everyone should strictly follow the principles of varna and asrama as given in
the sastra. In the Visnu Purana (3.8.9) it is said:
varnasramacaravata
purusena parah puman
visnur aradhyate pantha
nanyat tat-tosa-karanam
One should focus upon the destination for progress, which is to become Krsna conscious. This is the
aim and end of all varnas and asramas. However, if Visnu is not worshiped, the followers of the
varnasrama institution manufacture some concocted God. Thus it has now become fashionable for any
rascal or fool to be elected God, and there are many missionaries who have concocted their own gods,
giving up their relationship with the real God. In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that one who worships
the demigods has lost his intelligence. Nonetheless we find that even an illiterate person who has lost all
intelligence is elected God, and although he has a temple, it has meat-eating sannyasis, and many polluted
activities go on there. This type of religious system, which misguides its poor followers, is strictly
forbidden. Such pretentious religions should be stopped altogether.
The original system is that a brahmana should actually become a brahmana; he should not only take
birth in a brahmana family, but must also be qualified. Also, even if one is not born in a brahmana family
but has brahminical qualifications, he must be considered a brahmana. By strictly following this system,
one can be happy without extra endeavor. Sva-bhava-vihito dharmah kasya nestah prasantaye. The real
aim of life is to mitigate distress, and one can do this very easily by following the principles of sastra.
