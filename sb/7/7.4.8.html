<h2>Synonyms</h2>
deva-udyana--of the famous garden of the demigods; sriya--by the opulences; justam--enriched;
adhyaste sma--remained in; tri-pistapam--the higher planetary system, where various demigods live;
mahendra-bhavanam--the palace of Indra, the King of heaven; saksat--directly; nirmitam--constructed;
visvakarmana--by the famous architect of the demigods, Visvakarma; trailokya--of all the three worlds;
laksmi-ayatanam--the residence of the goddess of fortune; adhyuvasa--lived in; akhila-rddhi-mat--
possessing the opulence of the entire universe.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Hiranyakasipu, who possessed all opulence, began residing in heaven, with its famous Nandana garden,
which is enjoyed by the demigods. In fact, he resided in the most opulent palace of Indra, the King of
heaven. The palace had been directly constructed by the demigod architect Visvakarma and was as
beautifully made as if the goddess of fortune of the entire universe resided there.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this description it appears that all the heavenly planets of the upper planetary system are
thousands upon thousands of times more opulent than the lower planetary system in which we live.
Visvakarma, the famous heavenly architect, is known as the constructor of many wonderful buildings in
the upper planets, where there are not only beautiful buildings, but also many opulent gardens and parks,
which are described as nandana-devodyana, gardens quite fit to be enjoyed by the demigods. This
description of the upper planetary system and its opulences is to be understood from authoritative
scriptures like the Vedic literatures. Telescopes and the other imperfect instruments of scientists are
inadequate for evaluating the upper planetary system. Although such instruments are needed because the
vision of the so-called scientists is imperfect, the instruments themselves are also imperfect. Therefore the
upper planets cannot be appraised by imperfect men using imperfect man-made instruments. Direct
information received from the Vedic literature, however, is perfect, We therefore cannot accept the
statement that there are no opulent residences on planets other than this earth.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The steps of King Indra's residence were made of coral, the floor was bedecked with invaluable
emeralds, the walls were of crystal, and the columns of vaidurya stone. The wonderful canopies were
beautifully decorated, the seats were bedecked with rubies, and the silk bedding, as white as foam, was
decorated with pearls. The ladies of the palace, who were blessed with beautiful teeth and the most
wonderfully beautiful faces, walked here and there in the palace, their ankle bells tinkling melodiously,
and saw their own beautiful reflections in the gems. The demigods, however, being very much oppressed,
had to bow down and offer obeisances at the feet of Hiranyakasipu, who chastised the demigods very
severely and for no reason. Thus Hiranyakasipu lived in the palace and severely ruled everyone.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu was so powerful in the heavenly planets that all the demigods except Lord Brahma, Lord
Siva and Lord Visnu were forced to engage in his service. Indeed, they were afraid of being severely
punished if they disobeyed him. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti has compared Hiranyakasipu to Maharaja
Vena, who was also atheistic and scornful of the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas. Yet
Maharaja Vena was afraid of some of the great sages such as Bhrgu, whereas Hiranyakasipu ruled in such a
way that everyone feared him but Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Hiranyakasipu was so alert
against being burnt to ashes by the anger of great sages like Bhrgu that by dint of austerity he surpassed
their power and placed even them under his subordination. It appears that even in the higher planetary
systems, to which people are promoted by pious activities, disturbances are created by asuras like
Hiranyakasipu. No one in the three worlds can live in peace and prosperity without disturbance.
