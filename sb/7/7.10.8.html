<p></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, because of lusty desires from the very beginning of one's birth, the functions of one's senses,
mind, life, body, religion, patience, intelligence, shyness, opulence, strength, memory and truthfulness are
vanquished.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, kamam hrd-rogam. Materialistic life means that one is afflicted by a
formidable disease called lusty desire. Liberation means freedom from lusty desires because it is only due
to such desires that one must accept repeated birth and death. As long as one's lusty desires are
unfulfilled, one must take birth after birth to fulfill them. Because of material desires, therefore, one
performs various types of activities and receives various types of bodies with which to try to fulfill desires
that are never satisfied. The only remedy is to take to devotional service, which begins when one is free
from all material desires. Anyabhilasita-sunyam. Anya-abhilasita means "material desire," and sunyam
means "free from." The spiritual soul has spiritual activities and spiritual desires, as described by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi. Unalloyed devotion
to the service of the Lord is the only spiritual desire. To fulfill this spiritual desire, however, one must be
free from all material desires. Desirelessness means freedom from material desires. This is described by
Srila Rupa Gosvami as Anyabhilasita-sunyam. As soon as one has material desires, one loses his spiritual
identity. Then all the paraphernalia of one's life, including one's senses, body, religion, patience and
intelligence, are deviated from one's original Krsna consciousness. As soon as one has material desires,
one cannot properly use his senses, intelligence, mind and so on for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Mayavadi philosophers want to become impersonal, senseless and mindless, but
that is not possible. The living entity must be living, always existing with desires, ambitions and so on.
These should be purified, however, so that one can desire spiritually and be spiritually ambitious, without
material contamination. In every living entity these propensities exist because he is a living entity. When
materially contaminated, however, one is put into the hands of material misery (janma-mrtyu jaravyadhi).
If one wants to stop repeated birth and death, one must take to the devotional service of the
Lord.
sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam
tat-paratvena nirmalam
hrsikena hrsikesasevanam
bhaktir ucyate
"Bhakti, or devotional service, means engaging all our senses in the service of the Lord, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the master of all the senses. When the spirit soul renders service unto the
Supreme, there are two side effects. One is freed from all material designations, and, simply by being
employed in the service of the Lord, one's senses are purified."
