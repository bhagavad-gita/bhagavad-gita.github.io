<h2>Text</h2>
alaksito 'gnau patitah patangamo
yatha nrsimhaujasi so 'suras tada
na tad vicitram khalu sattva-dhamani
sva-tejasa yo nu purapibat tamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
alaksitah--invisible; agnau--in the fire; patitah--fallen; patangamah--an insect; yatha--just as; nrsimha--of
Lord Nrsimhadeva; ojasi--in the effulgence; sah--he; asurah--Hiranyakasipu; tada--at that time; na--not;
tat--that; vicitram--wonderful; khalu--indeed; sattva-dhamani--in the Supreme personality of Godhead,
who is situated in pure goodness; sva-tejasa--by His own effulgence; yah--He who (the Lord); nu--indeed;
pura--formerly; apibat--swallowed up; tamah--the darkness within the material creation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as a small insect falls forcefully into a fire and the insignificant creature becomes invisible, when
Hiranyakasipu attacked the Lord, who was full of effulgence, Hiranyakasipu became invisible. This is not
at all astonishing, for the Lord is always situated in pure goodness. Formerly, during creation, He entered
the dark universe and illuminated it by His spiritual effulgence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is situated transcendentally, in pure goodness. The material world is generally controlled by
tamo-guna, the quality of ignorance, but the spiritual world, because of the presence of the Lord and His
effulgence, is free from all contamination by darkness, passion or contaminated goodness. Although there
is a tinge of goodness in this material world in terms of the brahminical qualifications, such qualifications
sometimes become invisible because of the strong prevalence of the modes of passion and ignorance. But
because the Lord is always transcendentally situated, the material modes of passion and ignorance cannot
touch Him. Whenever the Lord is present, there cannot be any darkness from the mode of ignorance. It is
stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 22.31):
krsna----surya-sama, maya haya andhakara
yahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara
"Godhead is light. Nescience is darkness. Where there is Godhead there is no nescience." This material
world is full of darkness and ignorance of spiritual life, but by bhakti-yoga this ignorance is dissipated.
The Lord appeared because of the bhakti-yoga exhibited by Prahlada Maharaja, and as soon as the Lord
appeared, the influence of Hiranyakasipu's passion and ignorance was vanquished as the Lord's quality of
pure goodness, or the Brahman effulgence, became prominent. In that prominent effulgence,
Hiranyakasipu became invisible, or his influence became insignificant. An example illustrating how the
darkness of the material world is vanquished is given in the sastra. When Brahma was created from the
lotus stem growing from the abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, Lord Brahma saw everything to be dark,
but when he received knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything became clear, as
everything becomes clear when one comes from night to sunshine. The important point is that as long as
we are in the material modes of nature, we are always in darkness. This darkness cannot be dissipated
without the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is invoked by the practice of bhaktiyoga.
Bhakti-yoga creates a transcendental situation with no tinges of material contamination.
