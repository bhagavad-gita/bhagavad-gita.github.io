ity aksaratayatmanam
cin-matram avasesitam
jnatvadvayo 'tha viramed
dagdha-yonir ivanalah
SYNONYMS
iti--thus; aksarataya--because of being spiritual; atmanam--oneself (the individual soul); cit-matram--
completely spiritual; avasesitam--the remaining balance (after the material elements are merged, one after
another, into the original Supersoul); jnatva--understanding; advayah--without differentiation, or of the
same quality as the Paramatma; atha--thus; viramet--one should cease from material existence; dagdhayonih--
whose source (the wood) has burnt up; iva--like; analah--flames.
TRANSLATION
When all the material designations have thus merged into their respective material elements, the living
beings, who are all ultimately completely spiritual, being one in quality with the Supreme Being, should
cease from material existence, as flames cease when the wood in which they are burning is consumed.
When the material body is returned to its various material elements, only the spiritual being remains. This
spiritual being is Brahman and is equal in quality with Parabrahman.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Twelfth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes."
Chapter Thirteen
The Behavior of a Perfect Person
This Thirteenth Chapter describes the regulative principles for sannyasis and also describes the history
of an avadhuta. It concludes with a description of perfection for the student in spiritual advancement.
Sri Narada Muni has been describing the symptoms of various asramas and varnas. Now, in this chapter,
he specifically describes the regulative principles to be followed by sannyasis. After retiring from family
life, one should accept the status of vanaprastha, in which he must formally accept the body as his means
of existence but gradually forget the bodily necessities of life. After vanaprastha life, having left home, one
should travel to different places as a sannyasi. Without bodily comforts and free from dependence on
anyone with respect to bodily necessities, one should travel everywhere, wearing almost nothing or
actually walking naked. Without association with ordinary human society, one should beg alms and
always be satisfied in himself. One should be a friend to every living entity and be very peaceful in Krsna
consciousness. A sannyasi should travel alone in this way, not caring for life or death, waiting for the time
when he will leave his material body. He should not indulge in unnecessary books or adopt professions
like astrology, nor should he try to become a great orator. He should also give up the path of unnecessary
argument and should not depend on anyone under any circumstances. He should not try to allure people
into becoming his disciples just so that the number of his disciples may increase. He should give up the
habit of reading many books as a means of livelihood, and he should not attempt to increase the number
of temples and mathas, or monasteries. When a sannyasi thus becomes completely independent, peaceful
and equipoised, he can select the destination he desires after death and follow the principles by which to
reach that destination. Although fully learned, he should always remain silent, like a dumb person, and
travel like a restless child.
In this regard, Narada Muni described a meeting between Prahlada and a saintly person who had
adopted the mode of life of a python. In this way he described the symptoms of a paramahamsa. A person
who has attained the paramahamsa stage knows very well the distinction between matter and spirit. He is
not at all interested in gratifying the material senses, for he is always deriving pleasure from devotional
service to the Lord. He is not very anxious to protect his material body. Being satisfied with whatever he
attains by the grace of the Lord, he is completely independent of material happiness and distress, and thus
he is transcendental to all regulative principles. Sometimes he accepts severe austerities, and sometimes
he accepts material opulence. His only concern is to satisfy Krsna, and for that purpose he can do
anything and everything, without reference to the regulative principles. He is never to be equated with
materialistic men, nor is he subject to the judgments of such men.
