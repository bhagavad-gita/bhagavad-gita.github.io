<h2>Text</h2>
adhyatmikadibhir duhkhair
avimuktasya karhicit
martyasya krcchropanatair
arthaih kamaih kriyeta kim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
adhyatmika-adibhih--adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika; duhkhaih--by the threefold miseries of
material life; avimuktasya--of one who is not freed from such miserable conditions (or one who is
subjected to birth, death, old age and disease); karhicit--sometimes; martyasya--of the living entity
subjected to death; krcchra-upanataih--things obtained because of severe miseries; arthaih--even if some
benefit is derived; kamaih--which can fulfill one's material desires; kriyeta--what do they do; kim--and
what is the value of such happiness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Materialistic activities are always mixed with three kinds of miserable conditions--adhyatmika,
adhidaivika and adhibautika. Therefore, even if one achieves some success by performing such activities,
what is the benefit of this success? One is still subjected to birth, death, old age, disease and the reactions
of his fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the materialistic way of life, if a poor man, after laboring very, very hard, gets some
material profit at the end of his life, he is considered a success, even though he again dies while suffering
the threefold miseries--adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika. No one can escape the threefold
miseries of materialistic life, namely miseries pertaining to the body and mind, miseries pertaining to the
difficulties imposed by society, community, nation and other living entities, and miseries inflicted upon
us by natural disturbances from earthquakes, famines, droughts, floods, epidemics, and so on. If one
works very hard, suffering the threefold miseries, and then is successful in getting some small benefit,
what is the value of this benefit? Besides that, even if a karmi is successful in accumulating some material
wealth, he still cannot enjoy it, for he must die in bereavement. I have even seen a dying man begging a
medical attendant to increase his life by four years so that he could complete his material plans. Of course,
the medical man was unsuccessful in expanding the life of the man, who therefore died in great
bereavement. Everyone must die in this way, and after one's mental condition is taken into account by the
laws of material nature, he is given another chance to fulfill his desires in a different body. Material plans
for material happiness have no value, but under the spell of the illusory energy we consider them
extremely valuable. There were many politicians, social reformers and philosophers who died very
miserably, without deriving any practical value from their material plans. Therefore, a sane and sensible
man never desires to work hard under the conditions of threefold miseries, only to die in disappointment.
