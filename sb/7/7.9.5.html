TRANSLATION
Hiranyakasipu said: O most impudent, most unintelligent disruptor of the family, O lowest of mankind,
you have violated my power to rule you, and therefore you are an obstinate fool. Today I shall send you to
the place of Yamaraja.
PURPORT
Hiranyakasipu condemned his Vaisnava son Prahlada for being durvinita--ungentle, uncivilized, or
impudent. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, however, has derived a meaning from this word durvinita
by the mercy of the goddess of learning, Sarasvati. He says that duh refers to this material world. This is
confirmed by Lord Krsna in His instruction in Bhagavad-gita that this material world is duhkhalayam, full
of material conditions. Vi means visesa, "specifically," and nita means "brought in." By the mercy of the
Supreme Lord, Prahlada Maharaja was especially brought to this material world to teach people how to
get out of the material condition. Lord Krsna says, yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata. When
the entire population, or part of it, becomes forgetful of its own duty, Krsna comes. When Krsna is not
present the devotee is present, but the mission is the same: to free the poor conditioned souls from the
clutches of the maya that chastises them.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura further explains that the word mandatman means manda--very bad
or very slow in spiritual realization. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.1.10), mandah sumanda-matayo
manda-bhagya. Prahlada Maharaja is the guide of all the mandas, or bad living entities who are under the
influence of maya. He is the benefactor even of the slow and bad living entities in this material world.
Kula-bheda-karadhama: by his actions, Prahlada Maharaja made great personalities who established big,
big families seem insignificant. Everyone is interested in his own family and in making his dynasty
famous, but Prahlada Maharaja was so liberal that he made no distinction between one living entity and
another. Therefore he was greater than the great prajapatis who established their dynasties. The word
stabdham means obstinate. A devotee does not care for the instructions of the asuras. When they give
instructions, he remains silent. A devotee cares about the instructions of Krsna, not those of demons or
nondevotees. He does not give any respect to a demon, even though the demon be his father. Macchasanodvrttam:
Prahlada Maharaja was disobedient to the orders of his demoniac father. Yama-ksayam:
every conditioned soul is under the control of Yamaraja, but Hiranyakasipu said that he considered
Prahlada Maharaja his deliverer, for Prahlada would stop Hiranyakasipu's repetition of birth and death.
Because Prahlada Maharaja, being a great devotee, was better than any yogi, Hiranyakasipu was to be
brought among the society of bhakti-yogis. Thus Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has explained these
words in a very interesting way as they can be interpreted from the side of Sarasvati, the mother of
learning.
