<h2>Text</h2>
yasya yal laksanam proktam
pumso varnabhivyanjakam
yad anyatrapi drsyeta
tat tenaiva vinirdiset
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasya--of whom; yat--which; laksanam--symptom; proktam--described (above); pumsah--of a person;
varna-abhivyanjakam--indicating the classification (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, etc.); yat--if;
anyatra--elsewhere; api--also; drsyeta--is seen; tat--that; tena--by that symptom; eva--certainly; vinirdiset--
one should designate.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, as described above, even if he
has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Herein it is clearly stated by Narada Muni that one should not be accepted as a brahmana, ksatriya,
vaisya or sudra according to birth, for although this is going on now, it is not accepted by the sastras. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah. Thus the four
divisions of society--brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra--are to be ascertained according to qualities and
activities. If one was born in a brahmana family and has acquired the brahminical qualifications, he is to
be accepted as a brahmana; otherwise, he should be considered a brahma-bandhu. Similarly, if a sudra
acquires the qualities of a brahmana, although he was born in a sudra family, he is not a sudra; because he
has developed the qualities of a brahmana, he should be accepted as a brahmana. The Krsna
consciousness movement is meant to develop these brahminical qualities. Regardless of the community in
which one was born, if one develops the qualities of a brahmana he should be accepted as a brahmana,
and he then may be offered the order of sannyasa. Unless one is qualified in terms of the brahminical
symptoms, one cannot take sannyasa. In designating a person a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, birth
is not the essential symptom. This understanding is very important. Herein Narada Muni distinctly says
that one may be accepted according to the caste of his birth if he has the corresponding qualifications, but
otherwise he should not. One who has attained the qualifications of a brahmana, regardless of where he
was born, should be accepted as a brahmana. Similarly, if one has developed the qualities of a sudra or a
candala, regardless of where he was born, he should be accepted in terms of those symptoms.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Perfect Society: Four Social Classes."
Chapter Twelve
The Perfect Society: Four Spiritual Classes
This chapter particularly describes the brahmacari and the person in the vanaprastha stage, and it also
gives a general description of the four asramas--brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa. In the
previous chapter, the great saint Narada Muni has described the varna institution of society, and now, in
this chapter, he will describe the stages of spiritual advancement in the four asramas, which are known as
brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.
The brahmacari should live under the care of the true spiritual master, giving him sincere respect and
obeisances, acting as his menial servant, and always carrying out his order. The brahmacari should engage
himself in spiritual activities and study the Vedic literature under the direction of the spiritual master.
According to the brahmacarya system, he should dress with a belt, deerskin, and matted hair and should
bear a danda, waterpot and sacred thread. He should collect alms daily in the morning, and in the evening
whatever alms he has collected he should offer to the spiritual master. A brahmacari should accept
prasada upon the order of the spiritual master, and if the spiritual master sometimes forgets to order the
disciple to eat, the disciple should not take prasada on his own initiative; rather, he should fast. The
brahmacari should be trained to be satisfied with eating what is absolutely necessary, he should be very
expert in executing responsibilities, he should be faithful, and he should control his senses and try to
avoid the association of women as far as possible. A brahmacari should very strictly abstain from living
with women and should not meet with grhasthas and those too addicted to women. Nor should a
brahmacari speak in a lonely place with a woman.
After completing one's education as a brahmacari in this way, one should give daksina, an offering of
gratitude, to one's guru, and then one may leave for home and accept the next asrama--the grhasthaasrama--
or else one may continue in the brahmacarya-asrama without adulteration. The duties for the
grhastha-asrama and brahmacarya-asrama, as well as the duties for sannyasis, are prescribed in the sastras.
A grhastha is not meant to enjoy sex life without restriction. Indeed, the whole purpose of Vedic life is to
become free from sexual indulgence. All the asramas are recognized for spiritual progress, and therefore
although the grhastha-asrama gives a kind of license for sex life for a certain time, it does not allow
unrestricted sex life. Therefore, in grhastha life also, there is no illicit sex. A grhastha should not accept a
woman for sexual enjoyment. Wasting semen is also illicit sex.
After the grhastha-asrama is another asrama, known as vanaprastha, which is midway between grhastha
and sannyasa. A person in the vanaprastha order is restricted in eating food grains and forbidden to eat
fruits that have not ripened on the tree. Nor should he cook food with fire, although he is allowed to eat
caru, grains that have been offered in a sacrificial fire. He may also eat fruits and grains that have grown
naturally. Living in a thatched cottage, the vanaprastha should endure all kinds of heat and cold. He
should not cut his nails or hair, and he should give up cleaning his body and teeth. He should wear tree
bark, accept a danda, and practice life in the forest, taking a vow to live there for twelve years, eight years,
four years, two years or at least one year. At last, when because of old age he can no longer perform the
activities of a vanaprastha, he should gradually stop everything and in this way give up his body.
