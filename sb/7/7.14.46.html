sri-narada uvaca
dharmam paramahamsyam vai
muneh srutvasuresvarah
pujayitva tatah prita
amantrya prayayau grham
SYNONYMS
sri-naradah uvaca--Sri Narada Muni said; dharmam--the occupational duty; paramahamsyam--of the
paramahamsas, the most perfect human beings; vai--indeed; muneh--from the saintly person; srutva--thus
hearing; asura-isvarah--the King of the asuras, Prahlada Maharaja; pujayitva--by worshiping the saintly
person; tatah--thereafter; pritah--being very pleased; amantrya--taking permission; prayayau--left that
place; grham--for his home.
TRANSLATION
Narada Muni continued: After Prahlada Maharaja, the King of the demons, heard these instructions
from the saint, he understood the occupational duties of a perfect person [paramahamsa]. Thus he duly
worshiped the saint, took his permission and then left for his own home.
PURPORT
As quoted in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 8.128), Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:
kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya
yei krsna-tattva-vetta sei 'guru' haya
A guru, or spiritual master, can be anyone who is well conversant with the science of Krsna. Therefore
although Prahlada Maharaja was a grhastha ruling over the demons, he was a paramahamsa, the best of
human beings, and thus he is our guru. In the list of gurus, or authorities, Prahlada Maharaja's name is
therefore mentioned:
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
(Bhag. 6.3.20)
The conclusion is that a paramahamsa is an exalted devotee (bhagavat-priya). Such a paramahamsa may
be in any stage of life--brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasa--and be equally liberated and
exalted.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Thirteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "The Behavior of a Perfect Person."
Chapter Fourteen
Ideal Family Life
This chapter describes the occupational duties of the householder according to the time, the country
and the performer. When Yudhisthira Maharaja became very much inquisitive about the occupational
duties for the householder, Narada Muni advised him that a grhastha's first duty is to be fully dependent
on Vasudeva, Krsna, and to try to satisfy Him in all respects by executing one's prescribed devotional
service. This devotional service will depend on the instructions of authorities and the association of
devotees who are actually engaged in devotional service. The beginning of devotional service is sravanam,
or hearing. One must hear from the mouths of realized souls. In this way the grhastha's attraction to his
wife and children will gradually be reduced.
As for the maintenance of his family, a grhastha, while earning what he requires for his living, must be
very conscientious and must not undergo extraordinary endeavor simply to accumulate money and
unnecessarily increase in material comforts. Although a grhastha should externally be very active in
earning his livelihood, he should internally be situated as a fully self-realized person, without attachment
for material gains. His dealings with family members or friends should be performed simply to fulfill their
purpose; one should not be extravagantly engaged in this way. Instructions from family members and
society should be accepted superficially, but in essence the grhastha should be engaged in occupational
duties advised by the spiritual master and sastra. Specifically a grhastha should engage in agricultural
activities to earn money. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam--agriculture, cow
protection and trade--are special duties of grhasthas. If by chance or by the grace of the Lord more money
comes, it should be properly engaged for the Krsna consciousness movement. One should not be eager to
earn more money simply for sensual pleasure. A grhastha should always remember that one who is
endeavoring to accumulate more money than necessary is to be considered a thief and is punishable by
the laws of nature.
A grhastha should be very much affectionate toward lower animals, birds and bees, treating them
exactly like his own children. A grhastha should not indulge in killing animals or birds for sense
gratification. He should provide the necessities of life even to the dogs and the lowest creatures and
should not exploit others for sense gratification. Factually, according to the instructions of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, every grhastha is a great communist who provides the means of living for everyone.
Whatever a grhastha may possess he should equally distribute to all living entities, without
discrimination. The best process is to distribute prasada.
A grhastha should not be very much attached to his wife; he should engage even his own wife in serving
a guest with all attention. Whatever money a grhastha accumulates by the grace of God he should spend
in five activities, namely worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, receiving Vaisnavas and saintly
persons, distributing prasada to the general public and to all living entities, offering prasada to his
forefathers, and also offering prasada to his own self. Grhasthas should always be ready to worship
everyone as mentioned above. The grhastha should not eat anything not offered to the Supreme
personality of Godhead. As it is said in the Bhagavad-gita (3.13), yajna-sistasinah santo mucyante sarvakilbisaih:
"The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is offered
first for sacrifice." The grhastha should also visit the holy places of pilgrimage mentioned in the puranas.
In this way he should fully engage in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the benefit of
his family, his society, his country, and humanity at large.
