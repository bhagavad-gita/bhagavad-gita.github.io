<h2>Text</h2>
kitah pesaskrta ruddhah
kudyayam tam anusmaran
samrambha-bhaya-yogena
vindate tat-svarupatam
evam krsne bhagavati
maya-manuja isvare
vairena puta-papmanas
tam apur anucintaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kitah--the grassworm; pesaskrta--by a bee; ruddhah--confined; kudyayam--in a hole in a wall; tam--that
(bee); anusmaran--thinking of; samrambha-bhaya-yogena--through intense fear and enmity; vindate--
attains; tat--of that bee; sva-rupatam--the same form; evam--thus; krsne--in Krsna; bhagavati--the
Personality of Godhead; maya-manuje--who appeared by His own energy in His eternal humanlike form;
isvare--the Supreme; vairena--by enmity; puta-papmanah--those purified of sins; tam--Him; apuh--
attained; anucintaya--by thinking of.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A grassworm confined in a hole of a wall by a bee always thinks of the bee in fear and enmity and later
becomes a bee simply because of such remembrance. Similarly, if the conditioned souls somehow or other
think of Krsna, who is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, they will become free from their sins. Whether thinking of
Him as their worshipable Lord or an enemy, because of constantly thinking of Him they will regain their
spiritual bodies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (4.10) the Lord says:
vita-raga-bhaya-krodha
man-maya mam upasritah
bahavo jnana-tapasa
puta mad-bhavam agatah
"Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me,
many, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me--and thus they all attained
transcendental love for Me." There are two ways of constantly thinking of Krsna--as a devotee and as an
enemy. A devotee, of course, by his knowledge and tapasya, becomes free from fear and anger and
becomes a pure devotee. Similarly, an enemy, although thinking of Krsna inimically, thinks of Him
constantly and also becomes purified. This is confirmed elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (9.30), where the
Lord says:
api cet su-duracaro
bhajate mam ananya-bhak
sadhur eva sa mantavyah
samyag vyavasito hi sah
"Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he engages in devotional service he is to be
considered saintly because he is properly situated." A devotee undoubtedly worships the Lord with rapt
attention. Similarly, if an enemy (suduracarah) always thinks of Krsna, he also becomes a purified
devotee. The example given here concerns the grassworm that becomes beelike because of constantly
thinking of the bee that forces it to enter a hole. By always thinking of the bee in fear, the grassworm
starts to become a bee. This is a practical example. Lord Krsna appears within this material world for two
purposes--paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: to protect the devotees and annihilate the
demons. The sadhus and devotees certainly think of the Lord always, but duskrtis, the demons like Kamsa
and Sisupala, also think of Krsna in terms of killing Him. By thinking of Krsna, both the demons and
devotees attain liberation from the clutches of material maya.
This verse uses the word maya-manuje. When Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in
His original spiritual potency (sambhavamy atma-mayaya), He is not forced to accept a form made by
material nature. Therefore the Lord is addressed as isvara, the controller of maya. He is not controlled by
maya. When a demon continuously thinks of Krsna because of enmity toward Him, he is certainly freed
from the sinful reactions of his life. To think of Krsna in any way, in terms of His name, form, qualities,
paraphernalia or anything pertaining to Him, is beneficial for everyone. Srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah
punya-sravana-kirtanah. Thinking of Krsna, hearing the holy name of Krsna or hearing the pastimes of
Krsna will make one pure, and then he will become a devotee. Our Krsna consciousness movement is
therefore trying to introduce the system of somehow or other letting everyone hear the holy name of
Krsna and take Krsna's prasada. Thus one will gradually become a devotee, and his life will be successful.
