<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead has given up His natural tendency of equality toward the demons
and demigods. Although He is the Supreme Person, now, influenced by maya, He has assumed the form of
a boar to please His devotees, the demigods, just as a restless child leans toward someone. I shall therefore
sever Lord Visnu's head from His trunk by my trident, and with the profuse blood from His body I shall
please my brother Hiranyaksa, who was so fond of sucking blood. Thus shall I too be peaceful.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The defect of the demoniac mentality is expressed in this verse very clearly. Hiranyakasipu thought that
Visnu also becomes partial, like a child whose mind is not steady or resolute. The Lord can change His
mind at any time, Hiranyakasipu thought, and therefore His words and activities are like those of
children. Actually, because the demons are ordinary human beings, their minds change, and being
materially conditioned, they think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is conditioned also. As the
Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: "Fools deride Me
when I descend in a human form."
Demons always think that Visnu can be killed. Therefore, being absorbed in thoughts of Visnu's form to
kill Him, at least they have the opportunity to think of Visnu unfavorably. Although they are not
devotees, their thinking of Visnu is effective, and thus they generally attain sayujya-mukti. Because the
demons consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary living being, they think that they can kill Lord Visnu as
one might kill an ordinary person. Another fact disclosed herein is that demons are very much fond of
sucking blood. Indeed, all of them are meat-eaters and bloodsuckers.
Hiranyakasipu accused the Supreme Lord of having a restless mind like that of a small child who can be
induced to do anything if simply offered some cakes and laddus. Indirectly, this indicates the true position
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):
patram puspam phalam toyam
yo me bhaktya prayacchati
tad aham bhakty-upahrtam
asnami prayatatmanah
"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it." The Lord
accepts the offerings of devotees because of their transcendental love. Because they are in love with the
Supreme Lord, they do not eat anything without offering it first to the Lord. The Lord does not hanker for
a small leaf or flower; He has enough to eat. Indeed, He is feeding all living entities. Nonetheless, because
He is very merciful and is bhakta-vatsala, very favorable to the devotees, He certainly eats whatever they
offer Him with love and devotion. This quality should not be misjudged to be childish. The highest
quality of the Supreme Lord is that He is bhakta-vatsala; in other words, He is always extremely pleased
with His devotees. As for the word maya, when used in reference to the dealings of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and His devotees, this word means "affection." The actions of the Lord to favor
His devotees are not disqualifications but signs of His natural affection.
As for rudhira, or the blood of Lord Visnu, since there is no possibility of severing Lord Visnu's head
from His body, there is no question of blood. But the garland that decorates Visnu's body is as red as
blood. When the demons achieve sayujya-mukti and leave behind their sinful activities, they are blessed
by Visnu's garland, which is red like blood. After attaining sayujya-mukti, the demons are sometimes
promoted to the Vaikuntha world, where they receive the reward of the Lord's garland prasada.
