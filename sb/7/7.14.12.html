<h2>Text</h2>
jahyad yad-arthe svan pranan
hanyad va pitaram gurum
tasyam svatvam striyam jahyad
yas tena hy ajito jitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jahyat--one may give up; yat-arthe--for whom; svan--one's own; pranan--life; hanyat--one may kill; va--
or; pitaram--the father; gurum--the teacher or spiritual master; tasyam--unto her; svatvam--ownership;
striyam--unto the wife; jahyat--one must give up; yah--one who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead);
tena--by him; hi--indeed; ajitah--cannot be conquered; jitah--conquered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One so seriously considers one's wife to be his own that he sometimes kills himself for her or kills
others, including even his parents or his spiritual master or teacher. Therefore if one can give up his
attachment to such a wife, he conquers the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never conquered by
anyone.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every husband is too much attached to his wife. Therefore, to give up one's connection with his wife is
extremely difficult, but if one can somehow or other give it up for the service of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, then the Lord Himself, although not able to be conquered by anyone, comes very much
under the control of the devotee. And if the Lord is pleased with a devotee, what is there that is
unobtainable? Why should one not give up his affection for his wife and children and take shelter of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead? Where is the loss of anything material? Householder life means
attachment for one's wife, whereas sannyasa means detachment from one's wife and attachment to Krsna.
