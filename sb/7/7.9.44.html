<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord Nrsimhadeva, I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested
only in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Himalayas or the
forest to meditate with vows of silence [mauna-vrata]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for
me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that
without Krsna consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I
wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the decision of the Vaisnava, the pure devotee of the Lord. For himself he has no problems, even
if he has to stay in this material world, because his only business is to remain in Krsna consciousness. The
Krsna conscious person can go even to hell and still be happy. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja said,
naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaranyah: "O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material
existence." The pure devotee is never unhappy in any condition of life. This is confirmed in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (6.17.28):
narayana-parah sarve
na kutascana bibhyati
svargapavarga-narakesv
api tulyartha-darsinah
"Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana,
never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all
the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord."
For a devotee, being situated in the heavenly planets and being in the hellish planets are equal, for a
devotee lives neither in heaven nor in hell but with Krsna in the spiritual world. The secret of success for
the devotee is not understood by the karmis and jnanis. Karmis therefore try to be happy by material
adjustment, and jnanis want to be happy by becoming one with the Supreme. The devotee has no such
interest. He is not interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest. Rather, his interest is
in the busiest part of the world, where he teaches people Krsna consciousness. The Krsna consciousness
movement was started for this purpose. We do not teach one to meditate in a secluded place just so that
one may show that he has become very much advanced and may be proud of his so-called transcendental
meditation, although he engages in all sorts of foolish materialistic activity. A Vaisnava like Prahlada
Maharaja is not interested in such a bluff of spiritual advancement. Rather, he is interested in enlightening
people in Krsna consciousness because that is the only way for them to become happy. Prahlada Maharaja
says clearly, nanyam tvad asya saranam bhramato'nupasye: "I know that without Krsna consciousness,
without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy." One wanders within the universe, life
after life, but by the grace of a devotee, a servant of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one can get the clue to
Krsna consciousness and then not only become happy in this world but also return home, back to
Godhead. That is the real target in life. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement are not at all
interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest, where one will only make a show of
meditation, nor are they interested in opening many schools for yoga and meditation in the cities. Rather,
every member of the Krsna consciousness movement is interested in going door to door to try to convince
people about the teachings of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the teachings of Lord Caitanya. That is the purpose
of the Hare Krsna movement. The members of the Krsna consciousness movement must be fully
convinced that without Krsna one cannot be happy. Thus the Krsna conscious person avoids all kinds of
pseudo spiritualists, transcendentalists, meditators, monists, philosophers and philanthropists.
