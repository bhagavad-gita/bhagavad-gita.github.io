sri-prahrada uvaca
ma mam pralobhayotpattya
saktamkamesu tair varaih
tat-sanga-bhito nirvinno
mumuksus tvam upasritah
SYNONYMS
sri-prahradah uvaca--Prahlada Maharaja said (to the Supreme Personality of Godhead); ma--please do
not; mam--me; pralobhaya--allure; utpattya--because of my birth (in a demoniac family); saktam--(I am
already) attached; kamesu--to material enjoyment; taih--by all those; varaih--benedictions of material
possessions; tat-sanga-bhitah--being afraid of such material association; nirvinnah--completely detached
from material desires; mumuksuh--desiring to be liberated from material conditions of life; tvam--unto
Your lotus feet; upasritah--I have taken shelter.
TRANSLATION
Prahlada Maharaja said: My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, because I was born in an
atheistic family I am naturally attached to material enjoyment. Therefore, kindly do not tempt me with
these illusions. I am very much afraid of material conditions, and I desire to be liberated from materialistic
life. It is for this reason that I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet.
PURPORT
Materialistic life means attachment to the body and everything in relationship to the body. This
attachment is based on lusty desires for sense gratification, specifically sexual enjoyment. Kamais tais tair
hrta-jnanah: when one is too attached to material enjoyment, he is bereft of all knowledge (hrta jnanah).
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, those who are attached to material enjoyment are mostly inclined to worship
the demigods to procure various material opulences. They are especially attached to worship of the
goddess Durga and Lord Siva because this transcendental couple can offer their devotees all material
opulence. Prahlada Maharaja, however, was detached from all material enjoyment. He therefore took
shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nrsimhadeva, and not the feet of any demigod. It is to be understood that
if one really wants release from this material world, from the threefold miseries and from janma-mrtyu
jara-vyadhi (birth, death, old age and disease), one must take shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, for without the Supreme Personality of Godhead one cannot get release from materialistic life.
Atheistic men are very much attached to material enjoyment. Therefore if they get some opportunity to
achieve more and more material enjoyment, they take it. Prahlada Maharaja, however, was very careful in
this regard. Although born of a materialistic father, because he was a devotee he had no material desires
(anyabhilasita-sunyam).
