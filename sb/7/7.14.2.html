sri-narada uvaca
grhesv avasthito rajan
kriyah kurvan yathocitah
vasudevarpanam saksad
upasita maha-munin
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--Sri Narada Muni replied; grhesu--at home; avasthitah--staying (a householder
generally stays home with his wife and children); rajan--O King; kriyah--activities; kurvan--performing;
yathocitah--suitable (as instructed by the guru and sastra); vasudeva--unto Lord Vasudeva; arpanam--
dedicating; saksat--directly; upasita--should worship; maha-munin--the great devotees.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni replied: My dear King, those who stay at home as householders must act to earn their
livelihood, and instead of trying to enjoy the results of their work themselves, they should offer these
results to Krsna, Vasudeva. How to satisfy Vasudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through the
association of great devotees of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The format for grhastha life should be dedication to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavadgita
(6.1) it is said:
anasritah karma-phalam
karyam karma karoti yah
sa sannyasi ca yogi ca
na niragnir na cakriyah
"One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced
order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work." Whether one acts
as a brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi, he must act only for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva--Krsna, the son of Vasudeva. This should be the principle for
everyone's life. Narada Muni has already described the principles of life for a brahmacari, vanaprastha and
sannyasi, and now he is describing how a grhastha should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The science of satisfying the Supreme Lord can be learned as described here: saksad upasita mahamunin.
The word maha-munin refers to great saintly persons or devotees. Saintly persons are generally
known as munis, or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcendental subject matters, and mahamunin
refers to those who have not only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged
in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. These persons are known as devotees.
Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot learn the science of vasudevarpana, or dedicating one's
life to Vasudeva, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In India the principles of this science were followed strictly. Even fifty years ago, I saw that in the
villages of Bengal and the suburbs of Calcutta, people engaged in hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam daily when
all their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed. Everyone would hear the
Bhagavatam. Bhagavata classes were held in every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which describes everything about the aim of life--liberation or salvation. This will be
clearly explained in the next verses.

srnvan bhagavato 'bhiksnam
avatara-kathamrtam
sraddadhano yatha-kalam
upasanta-janavrtah
sat-sangac chanakaih sangam
atma-jayatmajadisu
vimuncen mucyamanesu

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
srnvan--hearing; bhagavatah--of the Lord; abhiksnam--always; avatara--of the incarnations; katha--
narrations; amrtam--the nectar; sraddadhanah--being very faithful in hearing about the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; yatha-kalam--according to time (generally a grhastha can find time in the evening
or in the afternoon); upasanta--completely relieved of material activities; jana--by persons; avrtah--being
surrounded; sat-sangat--from such good association; sanakaih--gradually; sangam--association; atma--in
the body; jaya--wife; atma-ja-adisu--as well as in children; vimuncet--one should get free from the
attachment for such association; mucyamanesu--being severed (from him); svayam--personally; svapnavat--
like a dream; utthitah--awakened.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A grhastha must associate again and again with saintly persons, and with great respect he must hear the
nectar of the activities of the Supreme Lord and His incarnations as these activities are described in
Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Puranas. Thus one should gradually become detached from affection for his
wife and children, exactly like a man awakening from a dream.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Krsna consciousness movement has been established to give grhasthas all over the world an
opportunity to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita specifically. The process, as described in many
ways, is one of hearing and chanting (srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah). Everyone,
especially the grhasthas, who are mudha-dhi, ignorant about the goal of life, should be given
opportunities to hear about Krsna. Simply by hearing, by attending lectures in the different centers of the
Krsna consciousness movement, where topics of Krsna from Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam are
discussed, they will be purified of their sinful inclination for constant indulgence in illicit sex, meateating,
intoxication and gambling, which have all become prominent in modern days. Thus they can be
raised to the status of light. Punya-sravana-kirtanah. Simply by joining the kirtana--Hare Krsna, Hare
Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--and by hearing about
Krsna from Bhagavad-gita, one must be purified, especially if he also takes prasada. This is all going on in
the Krsna consciousness movement.
Another specific description here is srnvan bhagavato 'bhiksnam avatara-kathamrtam. It is not that
because one has once finished Bhagavad-gita he should not hear it again. The word abhiksnam is very
important. We should hear again and again. There is no question of stopping: even if one has read these
topics many times, he should go on reading again and again because bhagavat-katha, the words spoken by
Krsna and spoken by Krsna's devotees about Krsna, are amrtam, nectar. The more one drinks this
amrtam, the more he advances in his eternal life.
The human form of life is meant for liberation, but unfortunately, due to the influence of Kali-yuga,
every day the grhasthas are working hard like asses. Early in the morning they rise and travel even a
hundred miles away to earn bread. Especially in the Western countries, I have seen that people awaken at
five o'clock to go to offices and factories to earn their livelihood. People in Calcutta and Bombay also do
this every day. They work very hard in the office or factory, and again they spend three or four hours in
transportation returning home. Then they retire at ten o'clock and again rise early in the morning to go to
their offices and factories. This kind of hard labor is described in the sastras as the life of pigs and stooleaters.
Nayam deho deha-bhajam nrloke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhujam ye: "Of all living entities who
have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work
hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool."
(Bhag. 5.5.1) One must find some time for hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita. This is Vedic
culture. One should work eight hours at the most to earn his livelihood, and either in the afternoon or in
the evening a householder should associate with devotees to hear about the incarnations of Krsna and His
activities and thus be gradually liberated from the clutches of maya. However, instead of finding time to
hear about Krsna, the householders, after working hard in offices and factories, find time to go to a
restaurant or a club where instead of hearing about Krsna and His activities they are very much pleased to
hear about the political activities of demons and nondevotees and to enjoy sex, wine, women and meat
and in this way waste their time. This is not grhastha life, but demoniac life. The Krsna consciousness
movement, however, with its centers all over the world, gives such fallen and condemned persons an
opportunity to hear about Krsna.
In a dream we form a society of friendship and love, and when we awaken we see that it has ceased to
exist. Similarly, one's gross society, family and love are also a dream, and this dream will be over as soon
as one dies. Therefore, whether one is dreaming in a subtle way or a gross way, these dreams are all false
and temporary. One's real business is to understand that one is soul (aham brahmasmi) and that his
activities should therefore be different. Then one can be happy.
brahma-bhutah prasannatma
na socati na kanksati
samah sarvesu bhutesu
mad-bhaktim labhate param
"One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.
He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed toward all living entities. In that
state he attains pure devotional service unto Me." (Bg. 18.54) One who is engaged in devotional service
can very easily be liberated from the dream of materialistic life.
