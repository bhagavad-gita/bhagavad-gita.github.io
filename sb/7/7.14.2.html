<h2>Text</h2>
sri-narada uvaca
grhesv avasthito rajan
kriyah kurvan yathocitah
vasudevarpanam saksad
upasita maha-munin
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--Sri Narada Muni replied; grhesu--at home; avasthitah--staying (a householder
generally stays home with his wife and children); rajan--O King; kriyah--activities; kurvan--performing;
yathocitah--suitable (as instructed by the guru and sastra); vasudeva--unto Lord Vasudeva; arpanam--
dedicating; saksat--directly; upasita--should worship; maha-munin--the great devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Narada Muni replied: My dear King, those who stay at home as householders must act to earn their
livelihood, and instead of trying to enjoy the results of their work themselves, they should offer these
results to Krsna, Vasudeva. How to satisfy Vasudeva in this life can be perfectly understood through the
association of great devotees of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The format for grhastha life should be dedication to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavadgita
(6.1) it is said:
anasritah karma-phalam
karyam karma karoti yah
sa sannyasi ca yogi ca
na niragnir na cakriyah
"One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced
order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work." Whether one acts
as a brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi, he must act only for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva--Krsna, the son of Vasudeva. This should be the principle for
everyone's life. Narada Muni has already described the principles of life for a brahmacari, vanaprastha and
sannyasi, and now he is describing how a grhastha should live. The basic principle is to satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The science of satisfying the Supreme Lord can be learned as described here: saksad upasita mahamunin.
The word maha-munin refers to great saintly persons or devotees. Saintly persons are generally
known as munis, or thoughtful philosophers concerned with transcendental subject matters, and mahamunin
refers to those who have not only thoroughly studied the goal of life but who are actually engaged
in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva. These persons are known as devotees.
Unless one associates with devotees, one cannot learn the science of vasudevarpana, or dedicating one's
life to Vasudeva, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In India the principles of this science were followed strictly. Even fifty years ago, I saw that in the
villages of Bengal and the suburbs of Calcutta, people engaged in hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam daily when
all their activities ended, or at least in the evening before going to bed. Everyone would hear the
Bhagavatam. Bhagavata classes were held in every village, and thus people had the advantage of hearing
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which describes everything about the aim of life--liberation or salvation. This will be
clearly explained in the next verses.
