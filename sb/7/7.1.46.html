<h2>Text</h2>
tav atra ksatriyau jatau
matr-svasratmajau tava
adhuna sapa-nirmuktau
krsna-cakra-hatamhasau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tau--the two; atra--here, in the third birth; ksatriyau--ksatriyas or kings; jatau--born; matr-svasr-atmajau--
the sons of the mother's sister; tava--your; adhuna--now; sapa-nirmuktau--freed from the curse;
krsna-cakra--by the disc weapon of Krsna; hata--destroyed; amhasau--whose sins.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In their third birth, the same Jaya and Vijaya appeared in a family of ksatriyas as your cousins, the sons
of your aunt. Because Lord Krsna has struck them with His disc, all their sinful reactions have been
destroyed, and now they are free from the curse.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In their last birth, Jaya and Vijaya did not become demons or Raksasas. Instead they took birth in a very
exalted ksatriya family related to Krsna's family. They became first cousins of Lord Krsna and were
practically on an equal footing with Him. By personally killing them with His own disc, Lord Krsna
destroyed whatever sinful reactions were left in them because of the curse of the brahmanas. Narada Muni
explained to Maharaja Yudhisthira that by entering Krsna's body, Sisupala reentered Vaikunthaloka as the
Lord's associate. Everyone had seen this incident.
