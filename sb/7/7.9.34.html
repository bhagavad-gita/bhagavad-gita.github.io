tatah sabhayam upavistam uttame
nrpasane sambhrta-tejasam vibhum
alaksita-dvairatham atyamarsanam
pracanda-vaktram na babhaja kascana
SYNONYMS
tatah--thereafter; sabhayam--in the assembly house; upavistam--seated; uttame--on the best; nrpaasane--
throne (upon which King Hiranyakasipu used to sit); sambhrta-tejasam--in full effulgence;
vibhum--the Supreme Lord; alaksita-dvairatham--whose challenger or enemy was not seen; ati--very
much; amarsanam--fearsome (due to His anger); pracanda--terrible; vaktram--face; na--not; babhaja--
worshiped; kascana--anyone.
TRANSLATION
Manifesting a full effulgence and a fearsome countenance, Lord Nrsimha, being very angry and finding
no contestant to face His power and opulence, then sat down in the assembly hall on the excellent throne
of the king. Because of fear and obedience, no one could come forward to serve the Lord directly.
PURPORT
When the Lord sat on the throne of Hiranyakasipu, there was no one to protest; no enemy came forward
on behalf of Hiranyakasipu to fight with the Lord. This means that His supremacy was immediately
accepted by the demons. Another point is that although Hiranyakasipu treated the Lord as his bitterest
enemy, he was the Lord's faithful servant in Vaikuntha, and therefore the Lord had no hesitation in sitting
on the throne that Hiranyakasipu had so laboriously created. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks
in this connection that sometimes, with great care and attention, great saintly persons and rsis offer the
Lord valuable seats dedicated with Vedic mantras and tantras, but still the Lord does not sit upon those
thrones. Hiranyakasipu, however, had formerly been Jaya, the doorkeeper at the Vaikuntha gate, and
although he had fallen because of the curse of the brahmanas and had gotten the nature of a demon, and
although he had never offered anything to the Lord as Hiranyakasipu, the Lord is so affectionate to His
devotee and servant that He nonetheless took pleasure in sitting on the throne that Hiranyakasipu had
created. In this regard it is to be understood that a devotee is fortunate in any condition of his life.
