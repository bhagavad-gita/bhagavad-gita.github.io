<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
sri-hiranyakasipur uvaca
vyaktam tvam martu-kamo 'si
yo 'timatram vikatthase
mumursunam hi mandatman
nanu syur viklava girah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-hiranyakasipuh uvaca--the blessed Hiranyakasipu said; vyaktam--evidently; tvam--you; martukamah--
desirous of death; asi--are; yah--one who; atimatram--without limit; vikatthase--are boasting (as if
you had conquered your senses whereas your father could not do so); mumursunam--of persons who are
about to meet immediate death; hi--indeed; manda-atman--O unintelligent rascal; nanu--certainly; syuh--
become; viklavah--confused; girah--the words.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Hiranyakasipu replied: You rascal, you are trying to minimize my value, as if you were better than me at
controlling the senses. This is over-intelligent. I can therefore understand that you desire to die at my
hands, for this kind of nonsensical talk is indulged in by those about to die.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said in Hitopadesa, upadeso hi murkhanam prokopaya na santaye. If good instructions are given to
a foolish person, he does not take advantage of them, but becomes more and more angry. Prahlada
Maharaja's authorized instructions to his father were not accepted by Hiranyakasipu as truth; instead
Hiranyakasipu became increasingly angry at his great son, who was a pure devotee. This kind of difficulty
always exists when a devotee preaches Krsna consciousness to persons like Hiranyakasipu, who are
interested in money and women. (The word hiranya means "gold," and kasipu refers to cushions or good
bedding.) Moreover, a father does not like to be instructed by his son, especially if the father is a demon.
Prahlada Maharaja's Vaisnava preaching to his demoniac father was indirectly effective, for because of
Hiranyakasipu's excessive jealousy of Krsna and His devotee, he was inviting Nrsimhadeva to kill him
very quickly. Thus he was expediting his being killed by the Lord Himself. Although Hiranyakasipu was a
demon, he is described here by the added word sri. Why? The answer is that fortunately he had such a
great devotee son as Prahlada Maharaja. Thus although he was a demon, he would attain salvation and
return home, back to Godhead.
