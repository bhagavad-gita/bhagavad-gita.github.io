<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King Yudhisthira, many persons with varied experience, many legal advisers, many learned scholars
and many persons eligible to become presidents of learned assemblies fall down into hellish life because of
not being satisfied with their positions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
For spiritual advancement, one should be materially satisfied, for if one is not materially satisfied, his
greed for material development will result in the frustration of his spiritual advancement. There are two
things that nullify all good qualities. One is poverty. Daridra-doso guna-rasi-nasi. If one is povertystricken,
all his good qualities become null and void. Similarly, if one becomes too greedy, his good
qualifications are lost. Therefore the adjustment is that one should not be poverty-stricken, but one must
try to be fully satisfied with the bare necessities of life and not be greedy. For a devotee to be satisfied with
the bare necessities is therefore the best advice for spiritual advancement. Learned authorities in
devotional life consequently advise that one not endeavor to increase the number of temples and mathas.
Such activities can be undertaken only by devotees experienced in propagating the Krsna consciousness
movement. All the acaryas in South India, especially Sri Ramanujacarya, constructed many big temples,
and in North India all the Gosvamis of Vrndavana constructed large temples. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Thakura also constructed large centers, known as Gaudiya Mathas. Therefore temple
construction is not bad, provided proper care is taken for the propagation of Krsna consciousness. Even if
such endeavors are considered greedy, the greed is to satisfy Krsna, and therefore these are spiritual
activities.
