strinam ca pati-devanam
tac-chusrusanukulata
tad-bandhusv anuvrttis ca
nityam tad-vrata-dharanam
SYNONYMS
strinam--of women; ca--also; pati-devanam--who have accepted their husbands as worshipable; tatsusrusa--
readiness to render service to her husband; anukulata--being favorably disposed towards her
husband; tat-bandhusu--unto the friends and relatives of the husband; anuvrttih--being similarly disposed
(to treat them well for the satisfaction of the husband); ca--and; nityam--regularly; tat-vrata-dharanam--
accepting the vows of the husband or acting exactly as the husband acts.
TRANSLATION
To render service to the husband, to be always favorably disposed toward the husband, to be equally
well disposed toward the husband's relatives and friends, and to follow the vows of the husband--these are
the four principles to be followed by women described as chaste.
PURPORT
It is very important for peaceful householder life that a woman follow the vow of her husband. Any
disagreement with the husband's vow will disrupt family life. In this regard, Canakya Pandita gives a very
valuable instruction: dampatyoh kalaho nasti tatra srih svayam agatah. When there are no fights between
husband and wife, the goddess of fortune automatically comes to the home. A woman's education should
be conducted along the lines indicated in this verse. The basic principle for a chaste woman is to be
always favorably disposed toward her husband. In Bhagavad-gita (1.40) it is said, strisu dustasu varsneya
jayate varna-sankarah: if the women are polluted, there will be varna-sankara population. In modern
terms, the varna-sankara are the hippies, who do not follow any regulative injunctions. Another
explanation is that when the population is varna-sankara, no one can know who is on what platform. The
varnasrama system scientifically divides society into four varnas and four asramas, but in varna-sankara
society there are no such distinctions, and no one can know who is who. In such a society, no one can
distinguish between a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya and a sudra. For peace and happiness in the material
world, the varnasrama institution must be introduced. The symptoms of one's activities must be defined,
and one must be educated accordingly. Then spiritual advancement will automatically be possible.

TRANSLATION
A chaste woman must dress nicely and decorate herself with golden ornaments for the pleasure of her
husband. Always wearing clean and attractive garments, she should sweep and clean the household with
water and other liquids so that the entire house is always pure and clean. She should collect the
household paraphernalia and keep the house always aromatic with incense and flowers and must be ready
to execute the desires of her husband. Being modest and truthful, controlling her senses, and speaking in
sweet words, a chaste woman should engage in the service of her husband with love, according to time
and circumstances.
