<h2>Text</h2>
anyathedam vidhasye 'ham
ayatha purvam ojasa
kim anyaih kala-nirdhutaih
kalpante vaisnavadibhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anyatha--just the opposite; idam--this universe; vidhasye--shall make; aham--I; ayatha--inappropriate;
purvam--as it was before; ojasa--by dint of the power of my austerity; kim--what use; anyaih--with other;
kala-nirdhutaih--vanquished in due course of time; kalpa-ante--at the end of the millennium; vaisnavaadibhih--
with planets like Dhruvaloka or Vaikunthaloka.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
"By dint of my severe austerities, I shall reverse the results of pious and impious activities. I shall
overturn all the established practices within this world. Even Dhruvaloka will be vanquished at the end of
the millennium. Therefore, what is the use of it? I shall prefer to remain in the position of Brahma."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu's demoniac determination was explained to Lord Brahma by the demigods, who informed
him that Hiranyakasipu wanted to overturn all the established principles. After executing severe
austerities, people within this material world are promoted to the heavenly planets, but Hiranyakasipu
wanted them to be unhappy, suffering because of the diplomatic feelings of the demigods, even in the
heavenly planets. He wanted those who were harassed in this world by material transactions to be
unhappy for the same reason, even in the heavenly planets. Indeed, be wanted to introduce such
harassment everywhere. One might ask how this would be possible, since the universal order has been
established since time immemorial, but Hiranyakasipu was proud to declare that he would be able to do
everything by the power of his tapasya. He even wanted to make the Vaisnavas' position insecure. These
are some of the symptoms of asuric determination.
