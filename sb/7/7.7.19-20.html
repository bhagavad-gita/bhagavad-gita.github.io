<h2>Translation</h2>
"Atma" refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual, free from birth and
death, free from deterioration and free from material contamination. They are individual, they are the
knowers of the external body, and they are the foundation or shelter of everything. They are free from
material change, they are self-illuminated, they are the cause of all causes, and they are all-pervading.
They have nothing to do with the material body, and therefore they are always uncovered. With these
transcendental qualities, one who is actually learned must give up the illusory conception of life, in which
one thinks, "I am this material body, and everything in relationship with this body is mine."
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (15.7) Lord Krsna clearly says, mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah: "All the living
entities are part of Me." Therefore the living entities are qualitatively the same as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the leader, the Supreme among all the living entities. In the Vedas it is said, nityo
nityanam cetanas cetananam: the Lord is the chief individual living entity, the leader of the subordinate
living entities. Because the living entities are parts or samples of God, their qualities are not different from
those of the Supreme Lord. The living entities have the same qualities as the Lord, just as a drop of sea
water is composed of the same chemicals as the great sea itself. Thus there is oneness in quality but a
difference in quantity. One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by understanding the
sample, the living entity, because all the qualities of God exist in a minute quantity in the living entities.
There is oneness, but God is great whereas the living entities are extremely small. Anor aniyan mahato
mahiyan (Katha Upanisad 1.2.20). The living entities are smaller than the atom, but God is greater than
the greatest. Our conception of greatness may be represented by the sky because we think of the sky as
being unlimitedly big, but God is bigger than the sky. Similarly, we have knowledge that the living entities
are smaller than atoms, being one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair, yet the quality of being the
supreme cause of all causes exists in the living entity as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Indeed, it is due to the presence of the living entity that the body exists and bodily changes take place.
Similarly, it is because the Supreme Lord is within this universe that the changes dictated by the material
laws occur.
The word ekah, meaning "individual," is significant. As explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), mat-sthani
sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah. Everything, material and spiritual, including earth, water, air,
fire, sky and the living entities, exists on the platform of spirit soul. Although everything is an emanation
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not think that the Supreme Lord is dependent
upon anything else.
Both God and the living entity are fully conscious. As living entities, we are conscious of our bodily
existence. Similarly, the Lord is conscious of the gigantic cosmic manifestation. This is confirmed in the
Vedas. Yasmin dyauh prthivi cantariksam. Vijnataram adhikena vijaniyat. Ekam evadvitiyam. Atma-jyotih
samrad ihovaca. Sa iman lokan asrjata. Satyam jnanam anantam. Asango hy ayam purusah. purnasya
purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate. All these Vedic injunctions prove that both the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and the minute soul are individual. One is great, and the other is small, but both of them are
the cause of all causes--the corporally limited and the universally unlimited.
We should always remember that although we are equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
quality, we are never equal to Him in quantity. Persons with a small fund of intelligence, finding
themselves equal in quality with God, foolishly think that they are equal in quantity also. Their
intelligence is called avisuddha-buddhayah--unpolished or contaminated intelligence. When such
persons, after endeavoring hard for many, many lives to understand the supreme cause, are finally in
actual knowledge of Krsna, Vasudeva, they surrender unto Him (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma
sudurlabhah). Thus they become great mahatmas, perfect souls. If one is fortunate enough to understand
his relationship with God, knowing that God is great (vibhu) whereas the living entity is small (anu), he
is perfect in knowledge. The individual exists in darkness when he thinks that he is the material body and
that everything in relationship with the material body belongs to him. This is called aham mama (janasya
moho 'yam aham mameti). This is illusion. One must give up his illusory conception and thus become
fully aware of everything.
