etat sarvam grhasthasya
samamnatam yater api
guru-vrttir vikalpena
grhasthasyartu-gaminah
SYNONYMS
etat--this; sarvam--all; grhasthasya--of a householder; samamnatam--described; yateh api--even of the
person in the renounced order; guru-vrttih vikalpena--to follow the orders of the spiritual master;
grhasthasya--of the householder; rtu-gaminah--accepting sex only during the period favorable for
procreation.
TRANSLATION
All the rules and regulations apply equally to the householder and the sannyasi, the member of the
renounced order of life. The grhastha, however, is given permission by the spiritual master to indulge in
sex during the period favorable for procreation.
PURPORT
It is sometimes misunderstood that a grhastha, a householder, is permitted to indulge in sex at any time.
This is a wrong conception of grhastha life. In spiritual life, whether one is a grhastha, vanaprastha,
sannyasi or brahmacari, everyone is under the control of the spiritual master. For brahmacaris and
sannyasis there are strong restrictions on sexual indulgence. Similarly, there are strong restrictions for
grhasthas. Grhasthas should indulge in sex life only in accordance with the order of the guru. Therefore it
is mentioned here that one must follow the orders of the spiritual master (guru-vrttir vikalpena). When
the spiritual master orders, the grhastha may accept sex life. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.11).
Dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo 'smi: indulgence in sex life without disobedience to the religious rules
and regulations constitutes a religious principle. The grhastha is allowed to indulge in sex life during the
period favorable for procreation and in accordance with the spiritual master's order. If the spiritual
master's orders allow a grhastha to engage in sex life at a particular time, then the grhastha may do so;
otherwise, if the spiritual master orders against it, the grhastha should abstain. The grhastha must obtain
permission from the spiritual master to observe the ritualistic ceremony of garbhadhana-samskara. Then
he may approach his wife to beget children, otherwise not. A brahmana generally remains a brahmacari
throughout his entire life, but although some brahmanas become grhasthas and indulge in sex life, they
do so under the complete control of the spiritual master. The ksatriya is allowed to marry more than one
wife, but this also must be in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master. It is not that
because one is a grhastha he may marry as many times as he likes and indulge in sex life as he likes. This
is not spiritual life. In spiritual life, one must conduct one's whole life under the guidance of the guru.
Only one who executes his spiritual life under the direction of the spiritual master can achieve the mercy
of Krsna. Yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah. If one desires to advance in spiritual life but he acts
whimsically, not following the orders of the spiritual master, he has no shelter. Yasyaprasadan na gatih
kuto 'pi. Without the spiritual master's order, even the grhastha should not indulge in sex life.
