<h2>Text</h2>
tatheti guru-putroktam
anujnayedam abravit
dharmo hy asyopadestavyo
rajnam yo grha-medhinam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatha--in this way; iti--thus; guru-putra-uktam--advised by Sanda and Amarka, the sons of Sukracarya;
anujnaya--accepting; idam--this; abravit--said; dharmah--the duty; hi--indeed; asya--unto Prahlada;
upadestavyah--to be instructed; rajnam--of the kings; yah--which; grha-medhinam--who are interested in
householder life.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After hearing these instructions of Sanda and Amarka, the sons of his spiritual master, Hiranyakasipu
agreed and requested them to instruct Prahlada in that system of occupational duty which is followed by
royal householder families.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Hiranyakasipu wanted Prahlada Maharaja to be trained as a diplomatic king in ruling the kingdom, the
country or the world, but not to be advised about renunciation or the renounced order of life. The word
dharma here does not refer to some religious faith. As clearly stated, dharmo hy asyopadestavyo rajnam yo
grha-medhinam. There are two kinds of royal families--one whose members are simply attached to
household life and the other consisting of rajarsis, kings who govern with ruling power but are as good as
great saints. Prahlada Maharaja wanted to become a rajarsi, whereas Hiranyakasipu wanted him to become
a king attached to sense enjoyment (grha-medhinam). Therefore in the Aryan system there is varnasramadharma,
by which everyone should be educated according to his position in society's division of varna
(brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and asrama (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa).
A devotee purified by devotional service is always in the transcendental position above the mundane
qualities. Thus the difference between Prahlada Maharaja and Hiranyakasipu was that Hiranyakasipu
wanted to keep Prahlada in mundane attachment whereas Prahlada was above the modes of material
nature. As long as one is under the control of material nature, his occupational duty is different from that
of a person not under such control. One's real dharma, or occupational duty, is described in Srimad-
Bhagavatam (dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam). As described to his order carriers by Dharmaraja, or
Yamaraja, a living being is a spiritual identity, and therefore his occupational duty is also spiritual. The
real dharma is that which is advised in Bhagavad-gita: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja.
One must give up one's material occupational duties, just as one must give up his material body.
Whatever one's occupational duty, even according to the varnasrama system, one must give it up and
engage in one's spiritual function. One's real dharma, or occupational duty, is explained by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera 'nitya-dasa': every living being is an eternal servant of Krsna.
That is one's real occupational duty.
