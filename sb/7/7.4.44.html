<h2>Text</h2>
sri-yudhisthira uvaca
devarsa etad icchamo
veditum tava suvrata
yad atmajaya suddhaya
pitadat sadhave hy agham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-yudhisthirah uvaca--Maharaja Yudhisthira inquired; deva-rse--O best saintly person among the
demigods; etat--this; icchamah--we wish; veditum--to know; tava--from you; su-vrata--having the
determination for spiritual advancement; yat--because; atma-jaya--unto his own son; suddhaya--who was
pure and exalted; pita--the father, Hiranyakasipu; adat--gave; sadhave--a great saint; hi--indeed; agham--
trouble.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira said: O best of the saints among the demigods, O best of spiritual leaders, how did
Hiranyakasipu give so much trouble to Prahlada Maharaja, the pure and exalted saint, although Prahlada
was his own son? I wish to know about this subject from you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To know about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the characteristics of His pure devotee, one
must inquire from authorities like Devarsi Narada. One cannot inquire about transcendental subject
matters from a layman. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.25.25), satam prasangan mama virya-samvido
bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah: only by association with devotees can one authoritatively
understand the position of the Lord and His devotees. A devotee like Narada Muni is addressed as suvrata.
Su means "good," and vrata means "vow." Thus the word suvrata refers to a person who has nothing to do
with the material world, which is always bad. One cannot understand anything spiritual from a
materialistic scholar puffed up with academic knowledge. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya
mam abhijanati: one must try to understand Krsna by devotional service and from a devotee. Therefore
Yudhisthira Maharaja was quite right in wanting to learn further about Prahlada Maharaja from Sri Narada
Muni.
