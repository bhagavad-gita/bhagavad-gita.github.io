<h2>Text</h2>
tasmad vairanubandhena
nirvairena bhayena va
snehat kamena va yunjyat
kathancin neksate prthak
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; vaira-anubandhena--by constant enmity; nirvairena--by devotion; bhayena--by fear;
va--or; snehat--from affection; kamena--by lusty desires; va--or; yunjyat--one should concentrate;
kathancit--somehow or other; na--not; iksate--sees; prthak--something else.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore by enmity or by devotional service, by fear, by affection or by lusty desire--by all of these or
any one of them--if a conditioned soul somehow or other concentrates his mind upon the Lord, the result
is the same, for the Lord, because of His blissful position, is never affected by enmity or friendship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this verse one should not conclude that because Krsna is unaffected by favorable prayers or
unfavorable blasphemy one should therefore blaspheme the Supreme Lord. This is not the regulative
principle. Bhakti-yoga means anukulyena krsnanusilanam: one should serve Krsna very favorably. This is
the real injunction. Here it is said that although an enemy thinks of Krsna unfavorably, the Lord is
unaffected by such antidevotional service. Thus He offers His benedictions even to Sisupala and similarly
inimical conditioned souls. This does not mean, however, that one should be inimical toward the Lord.
The stress is given to the favorable execution of devotional service, not purposeful blasphemy of the Lord.
It is said:
nindam bhagavatah srnvams
tat-parasya janasya va
tato napaiti yah so 'pi
yaty adhah sukrtac cyutah
One who hears blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotees should immediately
take action or should leave. Otherwise he will be put into hellish life perpetually. There are many such
injunctions. Therefore as a regulative principle one should not be unfavorable toward the Lord but always
favorably inclined toward Him.
Sisupala's achievement of oneness with the Supreme Lord was different because Jaya and Vijaya, from
the very beginning of their material existence, were ordained to treat the Supreme Lord as an enemy for
three lives and then return home, back to Godhead. Jaya and Vijaya inwardly knew that Krsna is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they purposely became His enemies to be delivered from material
life. From the very beginning of their lives they thought of Lord Krsna as an enemy, and even though
blaspheming Lord Krsna, they chanted the holy name of Krsna constantly along with their inimical
thoughts. Thus they were purified because of chanting the holy name of Krsna. It is to be understood that
even a blasphemer can be freed from sinful activities by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Certainly,
therefore, freedom is assured for a devotee who is always favorable to the service of the Lord. This will be
clear from the following verse. By rapt attention fixed upon Krsna, one is purified, and thus one is
delivered from material life.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has very nicely explained the word bhayena, which means "by
fear." When the gopis went to Krsna in the dead of night, they certainly feared chastisement by their
relatives--their husbands, brothers and fathers--but nonetheless, not caring for their relatives, they went to
Krsna. There was certainly fear, but this fear could not check their devotional service to Krsna.
One should not mistakenly think that Lord Krsna must be worshiped by an inimical attitude like that of
Sisupala. The injunction is anukulyasya grahanam pratikulyasya varjanam: one should give up
unfavorable activities and accept only favorable conditions in devotional service. Generally, if one
blasphemes the Supreme Personality of Godhead he is punished. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita
(16.19):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
There are many such injunctions. One should not try to worship Krsna unfavorably; otherwise he must
be punished, at least for one life, to be purified. As one should not try to be killed by embracing an
enemy, a tiger or a snake, one should not blaspheme the Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His
enemy in order to be put into hellish life.
The purpose of this verse is to emphasize that even the enemy of the Lord can be delivered, not to speak
of His friend. Srila Madhvacarya also says in many ways that one should not blaspheme Lord Visnu
through one's mind, words or actions, for a blasphemer will go to hellish life along with his forefathers.
karmana manasa vaca
yo dvisyad visnum avyayam
majjanti pitaras tasya
narake sasvatih samah
In Bhagavad-gita (16.19-20) the Lord says:
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
asurim yonim apanna
mudha janmani janmani
mam aprapyaiva kaunteya
tato yanty adhamam gatim
"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean
of material existence, into various demoniac species of life. Attaining repeated birth amongst the species
of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable
type of existence." One who blasphemes the Lord is put into a family of asuras, in which there is every
chance of forgetting the service of the Lord. Lord Krsna further states in Bhagavad-gita (9.11-12):
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
Mudhas, rascals, blaspheme the Supreme Lord because He appears exactly like a human being. They do
not know the unlimited opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
moghasa mogha-karmano
mogha-jnana vicetasah
raksasim asurim caiva
prakrtim mohinim sritah
Anything done by those who have taken the attitude of enemies will be baffled (moghasah). If these
enemies try to be liberated or to merge into the existence of Brahman, if they desire to be elevated to the
higher planetary systems as karmis, or even if they desire to return home, back to Godhead, they will
certainly be baffled.
As for Hiranyakasipu, although he was extremely inimical toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
he always thought of his son, who was a great devotee. Therefore by the grace of his son, Prahlada
Maharaja, Hiranyakasipu was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
hiranyakasipus capi
bhagavan-nindaya tamah
vivaksur atyagat sunoh
prahladasyanubhavatah
The conclusion is that one should not give up pure devotional service. For one's own benefit, one
should not imitate Hiranyakasipu or Sisupala. This is not the way to achieve success.
