<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is always transcendental to material qualities, and
therefore He is called nirguna, or without qualities. Because He is unborn, He does not have a material
body to be subjected to attachment and hatred. Although the Lord is always above material existence,
through His spiritual potency He appeared and acted like an ordinary human being, accepting duties and
obligations, apparently like a conditioned soul.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
So-called attachment, detachment and obligations pertain to the material nature, which is an emanation
from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but whenever the Lord descends and acts in this material
world, He does so in His spiritual position. Although His activities materially appear different, spiritually
they are absolute and nondifferent. Thus it is an imposition upon the Supreme Lord to say that He is
envious of anyone or friendly to anyone.
In Bhagavad-gita (9.11) the Lord clearly says, avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: "Fools
deride Me when I descend in a human form." Krsna appears on this earth or within this universe without
any change in His spiritual body or spiritual qualities. Indeed, He is never influenced by the material
qualities. He is always free from such qualities, but He appears to act under material influence. This
understanding is aropita, or an imposition. Therefore Krsna says, janma karma ca me divyam: whatever
He does, being always transcendental, has nothing to do with material qualities. Evam yo vetti tattvatah:
only devotees can understand the truth of how He acts. The fact is that Krsna is never partial to anyone.
He is always equal to everyone, but because of imperfect vision, influenced by material qualities, one
imposes material qualities upon Krsna, and when one does so he becomes a mu-dha, a fool. When one
can properly understand the truth, one becomes devoted and nirguna, free from material qualities. Simply
by understanding the activities of Krsna one can become transcendental, and as soon as one is
transcendental he is fit to be transferred to the transcendental world. Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti
mam eti so 'rjuna: one who understands the activities of the Lord in truth is transferred to the spiritual
world after he gives up his material body.
