<h2>Translation</h2>
O my lord, Your Lordship is eternally awake, seeing everything that happens. As eternal time, you
reduce the duration of life for all living entities through your different parts, such as moments, seconds,
minutes and hours. Nonetheless, you are unchanged, resting in one place as the Supersoul, witness and
Supreme Lord, the birthless, all-pervading controller who is the cause of life for all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word kuta-stha is very important. Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is
situated everywhere, He is the central unchanging point. Isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati:
the Lord is situated in full in the core of everyone's heart. As indicated in the Upanisads by the word
ekatvam, although there are millions and millions of living entities, the Lord is situated as the Supersoul
in every one of them. Nonetheless, He is one in many. As stated in the Brahma-samhita, advaitam acyutam
anadim ananta-rupam: He has many forms, yet they are advaita--one and unchanging. Since the Lord is
all-pervading, He is also situated in eternal time. The living entities are described as parts and parcels of
the Lord because He is the life and soul of all living entities, being situated within their hearts as the
antaryami, as enunciated by the philosophy of inconceivable oneness and difference (acintyabhedabheda).
Since the living entities are part of God, they are one in quality with the Lord, yet they are
different from Him. The Supersoul, who inspires all living entities to act, is one and changeless. There are
varieties of subjects, objects and activities, yet the Lord is one.
