<h2>Text</h2>
saila dronibhir akridam
sarvartusu gunan drumah
dadhara loka-palanam
eka eva prthag gunan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sailah--the hills and mountains; dronibhih--with the valleys between them; akridam--pleasure grounds
for Hiranyakasipu; sarva--all; rtusu--in the seasons of the year; gunan--different qualities (fruits and
flowers); drumah--the plants and trees; dadhara--executed; loka-palanam--of the other demigods in
charge of different departments of natural activity; ekah--alone; eva--indeed; prthak--different; gunan--
qualities.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The valleys between the mountains became fields of pleasure for Hiranyakasipu, by whose influence all
the trees and plants produced fruits and flowers profusely in all seasons. The qualities of pouring water,
drying and burning, which are all qualities of the three departmental heads of the universe--namely Indra,
Vayu and Agni--were all directed by Hiranyakasipu alone, without assistance from the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, tejo-vari-mrdam yatha vinimayah: this material world
is conducted by fire, water and earth, which combine and take shape. Here it is mentioned that the three
modes of nature (prthag gunan) act under the direction of different demigods. For example, King Indra is
in charge of pouring water, the demigod Vayu controls the air and dries up the water, whereas the
demigod controlling fire burns everything. Hiranyakasipu, however, by dint of his austere performance of
mystic yoga, became so powerful that he alone took charge of everything, without assistance from the
demigods.
