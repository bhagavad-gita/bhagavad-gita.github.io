<h2>Text</h2>
yatra yatra harer arca
sa desah sreyasam padam
yatra gangadayo nadyah
puranesu ca visrutah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatra yatra--wherever; hareh--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna; arca--the Deity is
worshiped; sah--that; desah--place, country or neighborhood; sreyasam--of all auspiciousness; padam--the
place; yatra--wherever; ganga-adayah--like the Ganges, Yamuna, Narmada and Kaveri; nadyah--sacred
rivers; puranesu--in the puranas (supplementary Vedic literature); ca--also; visrutah--are celebrated.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Auspicious indeed are the places where there is a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna,
in which He is duly worshiped, and also the places where there flow the celebrated sacred rivers
mentioned in the Puranas, the supplementary Vedic literatures. Anything spiritual done there is certainly
very effective.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many atheists who oppose the worship of the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in
the temple. In this verse, however, it is authoritatively stated that any place where the Deity is worshiped
is transcendental; it does not belong to the material world. It is also said that the forest is in the mode of
goodness, and therefore those who want to cultivate spiritual life are advised to go to the forest (vanam
gato yad dharim asrayeta). But one should not go to the forest simply to live like a monkey. Monkeys and
other ferocious animals also live in the forest, but a person who goes to the forest for spiritual culture
must accept the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as shelter (vanam gato yad dharim
asrayeta). One should not be satisfied simply to go to the forest; one must take shelter of the lotus feet of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age, therefore, since it is impossible to go to the forest for
spiritual culture, one is recommended to live in the temple community as a devotee, regularly worship the
Deity, follow the regulative principles and thus make the place like Vaikuntha. The forest may be in
goodness, the cities and villages in passion, and the brothels, hotels and restaurants in ignorance, but
when one lives in the temple community he lives in Vaikuntha. Therefore it is said here, sreyasam padam:
it is the best, most auspicious place.
In many places throughout the world we are constructing communities to give shelter to devotees and
worship the Deity in the temple. The Deity cannot be worshiped except by devotees. Temple worshipers
who fail to give importance to the devotees are third class. They are kanistha-adhikaris in the lower stage
of spiritual life. As it is said in Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.47):
arcayam eva haraye
pujam yah sraddhayehate
na tad-bhaktesu canyesu
sa bhaktah prakrtah smrtah
"A person who is very faithfully engaged in the worship of the Deity in the temple but does not know
how to behave toward devotees or people in general is called a prakrta-bhakta, or kanistha-adhikari."
Therefore, in the temple there must be the Deity of the Lord, and the Lord should be worshiped by the
devotees. This combination of the devotees and the Deity creates a first-class transcendental place.
Aside from this, if a grhastha devotee worships the salagrama-sila, or the form of the Deity at home, his
home also becomes a very great place. It was therefore customary for members of the three higher
classes--namely the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas--to worship the salagrama-sila, or a small Deity of
Radha-Krsna or Sita-Rama in each and every home. This made everything auspicious. But now they have
given up the Deity worship. Men have become modernized and are consequently indulging in all sorts of
sinful activities, and therefore they are extremely unhappy.
According to Vedic civilization, therefore, the holy places of pilgrimage are considered most sacred, and
still there are hundreds and thousands of holy places like Jagannatha Puri, Vrndavana, Hardwar,
Ramesvara, Prayaga and Mathura. India is the place for worshiping or for cultivating spiritual life. The
Krsna consciousness movement invites everyone from all over the world, without discrimination as to
caste or creed, to come to its centers and cultivate spiritual life perfectly.
