<h2>Text</h2>
kvacid rudati vaikunthacinta-
sabala-cetanah
kvacid dhasati tac-cintahlada
udgayati kvacit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kvacit--sometimes; rudati--cries; vaikuntha-cinta--by thoughts of Krsna; sabala-cetanah--whose mind
was bewildered; kvacit--sometimes; hasati--laughs; tat-cinta--by thoughts of Him; ahladah--being jubilant;
udgayati--chants very loudly; kvacit--sometimes.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of advancement in Krsna consciousness, he sometimes cried, sometimes laughed, sometimes
expressed jubilation and sometimes sang loudly.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse further clarifies the comparison of a devotee to a child. If a mother leaves her small child in
his bed or cradle and goes away to attend to some family duties, the child immediately understands that
his mother has gone away, and therefore he cries. But as soon as the mother returns and cares for the
child, the child laughs and becomes jubilant. Similarly, Prahlada Maharaja, being always absorbed in
thoughts of Krsna, sometimes felt separation, thinking, "Where is Krsna?" This is explained by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sunyayitam jagat sarvam govinda-virahena me. When an exalted devotee feels that
Krsna is invisible, having gone away, he cries in separation, and sometimes, when he sees that Krsna has
returned to care for him, he laughs, just as a child sometimes laughs upon understanding that his mother
is taking care of him. These symptoms are called bhava. In The Nectar of Devotion, various bhavas,
ecstatic conditions of a devotee, are fully described. These bhavas are visible in the activities of a perfect
devotee.
