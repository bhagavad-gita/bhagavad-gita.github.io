<h2>Text</h2>
kruddhasya yasya kampante
trayo lokah sahesvarah
tasya me 'bhitavan mudha
sasanam kim balo 'tyagah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

with their leaders; tasya--of that; me--of me (Hiranyakasipu); abhita-vat--without fear; mudha--
rascal; sasanam--ruling order; kim--what; balah--strength; atyagah--have overstepped.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My son Prahlada, you rascal, you know that when I am angry all the planets of the three worlds tremble,
along with their chief rulers. By whose power has a rascal like you become so impudent that you appear
fearless and overstep my power to rule you?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The relationship between a pure devotee and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely
relishable. A devotee never claims to be very powerful himself; instead, he fully surrenders to the lotus
feet of Krsna, being confident that in all dangerous conditions Krsna will protect His devotee. Krsna
Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: "O son of Kunti,
declare boldly that My devotee never perishes." The Lord requested Arjuna to declare this instead of
declaring it Himself because sometimes Krsna changes His view and therefore people might not believe
Him. Thus Krsna asked Arjuna to declare that a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished.
Hiranyakasipu was perplexed about how his five-year-old boy could be so fearless that he did not care
for the order of his very great and powerful father. A devotee cannot execute the order of anyone except
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the position of a devotee. Hiranyakasipu could understand
that this boy must have been very powerful, since the boy did not heed his orders. Hiranyakasipu asked
his son, kim balah: "How have you overcome my order? By whose strength have you done this?"
