<h2>Translation</h2>
Those in human society who are intelligent should give up the original cause of lamentation, illusion,
fear, anger, attachment, poverty and unnecessary labor. The original cause of all of these is the desire for
unnecessary prestige and money.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is the difference between Vedic civilization and the modern demoniac civilization. Vedic
civilization concerned itself with how to achieve self-realization, and for this purpose one was
recommended to have a small income to maintain body and soul together. The society was divided into
brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, and the members of this society would limit their endeavors to
meeting their minimum demands. The brahmanas, in particular, would have no material desires. Because
the ksatriyas had to rule the people, it was necessary for them to have money and prestige. But the vaisyas
were satisfied with agricultural produce and milk from the cow, and if by chance there were excess, trade
was allowed. The sudras were also happy, for they would get food and shelter from the three higher
classes. In the demoniac civilization of the present day, however, there is no question of brahmanas or
ksatriyas; there are only so-called workers and a flourishing mercantile class who have no goal in life.
According to Vedic civilization, the ultimate perfection of life is to take sannyasa, but at the present
moment people do not know why sannyasa is accepted. Because of misunderstanding, they think that one
accepts sannyasa to escape social responsibilities. But one does not accept sannyasa to escape from
responsibility to society. Generally one accepts sannyasa at the fourth stage of spiritual life. One begins as
a brahmacari then becomes a grhastha, a vanaprastha and finally a sannyasi to take advantage of the
duration of one's life by engaging oneself fully in self-realization. Sannyasa does not mean begging from
door to door to accumulate money for sense gratification. However, because in Kali-yuga people are more
or less prone to sense gratification, immature sannyasa is not recommended. Srila Rupa Gosvami writes in
his Nectar of Instruction (2):
atyaharah prayasas ca
prajalpo niyamagrahah
jana-sangas ca laulyam ca
sadbhir bhaktir vinasyati
"One's devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the following six activities: (1)
eating more than necessary or collecting more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane
things that are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters; (4)
practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of
spiritual advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently
or whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested in Krsna
consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements." A sannyasi should have an institution
meant to preach Krsna consciousness; he need not accumulate money for himself. We recommend that as
soon as money accumulates in our Krsna consciousness movement, fifty per cent of it should be invested
in printing books, and fifty per cent for expenditures, especially in establishing centers all over the world.
The managers of the Krsna consciousness movement should be extremely cautious in regard to this point.
Otherwise money will be the cause of lamentation, illusion, fear, anger, material attachment, material
poverty, and unnecessary hard work. When I was alone in Vrndavana, I never attempted to construct
mathas or temples; rather, I was fully satisfied with the small amount of money I could gather by selling
Back to Godhead, and thus I would provide for myself and also print the literature. When I went to
foreign countries, I lived according to the same principle, but when Europeans and Americans began to
give money profusely, I started temples and Deity worship. The same principle should still be followed.
Whatever money is collected should be spent for Krsna, and not a farthing for sense gratification. This is
the Bhagavata principle.
