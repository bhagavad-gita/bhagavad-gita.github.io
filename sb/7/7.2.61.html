<h2>Text</h2>
sri-narada uvaca
iti daitya-pater vakyam
ditir akarnya sasnusa
putra-sokam ksanat tyaktva
tattve cittam adharayat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-naradah uvaca--Sri Narada Muni said; iti--thus; daitya-pateh--of the King of the demons; vakyam--
the speech; ditih--Diti, the mother of Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa; akarnya--hearing; sa-snusa--with the
wife of Hiranyaksa; putra-sokam--the great bereavement for her son, Hiranyaksa; ksanat--immediately;
tyaktva--giving up; tattve--in the real philosophy of life; cittam--heart; adharayat--engaged.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Narada Muni continued: Diti, the mother of Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa, heard the instructions of
Hiranyakasipu along with her daughter-in-law, Rusabhanu, Hiranyaksa's wife. She then forgot her grief
over her son's death and thus engaged her mind and attention in understanding the real philosophy of
life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a relative dies one certainly becomes very much interested in philosophy, but when the funeral
ceremony is over one again becomes attentive to materialism. Even Daityas, who are materialistic persons,
sometimes think of philosophy when some relative meets death. The technical term for this attitude of the
materialistic person is smasana-vairagya, or detachment in a cemetery or place of cremation. As confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita, four classes of men receive an understanding of spiritual life and God--arta (the
distressed), jijnasu (the inquisitive), artharthi (one who desires material gains) and jnani (one who is
searching for knowledge). Especially when one is very much distressed by material conditions, one
becomes interested in God. Therefore Kuntidevi said in her prayers to Krsna that she preferred distress to
a happy mood of life. In the material world, one who is happy forgets Krsna, or God, but sometimes, if
one is actually pious but in distress, he remembers Krsna. Queen Kuntidevi therefore preferred distress
because it is an opportunity for remembering Krsna. When Krsna was leaving Kuntidevi for His own
country, Kuntidevi regretfully said that she was better off in distress because Krsna was always present,
whereas now that the Pandavas were situated in their kingdom, Krsna was going away. For a devotee,
distress is an opportunity to remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Seventh Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Hiranyakasipu, King of the Demons."
Chapter Three
Hiranyakasipu's Plan to Become Immortal
This chapter describes how Hiranyakasipu performed a severe type of austerity for material benefit, thus
causing great distress throughout the universe. Even Lord Brahma, the chief personality within this
universe, became somewhat disturbed and personally went to see why Hiranyakasipu was engaged in such
a severe austerity.
Hiranyakasipu wanted to become immortal. He wanted not to be conquered by anyone, not to be
attacked by old age and disease, and not to be harassed by any opponent. Thus he wanted to become the
absolute ruler of the entire universe. With this desire, he entered the valley of Mandara Mountain and
began practicing a severe type of austerity and meditation. Seeing Hiranyakasipu engaged in this austerity,
the demigods returned to their respective homes, but while Hiranyakasipu was thus engaged, a kind of
fire began blazing from his head, disturbing the entire universe and its inhabitants, including the birds,
beasts and demigods. When all the higher and lower planets became too hot to live on, the demigods,
being disturbed, left their abodes in the higher planets and went to see Lord Brahma, praying to him that
he curtail this unnecessary heat. The demigods disclosed to Lord Brahma Hiranyakasipu's ambition to
become immortal, overcoming his short duration of life, and to be the master of all the planetary systems,
even Dhruvaloka.
Upon hearing about the purpose of Hiranyakasipu's austere meditation, Lord Brahma, accompanied by
the great sage Bhrgu and great personalities like Daksa, went to see Hiranyakasipu. He then sprinkled
water from his kamandalu, a type of waterpot, upon Hiranyakasipu's head.
Hiranyakasipu, the King of the Daityas, bowed down before Lord Brahma, the creator of this universe,
offering respectful obeisances again and again and offering prayers. When Lord Brahma agreed to give
him benedictions, he prayed not be killed by any living entity, not to be killed in any place, covered or
uncovered, not to die in the daytime or at night, not to be killed by any weapon, on land or in the air, and
not to be killed by any human being, animal, demigod or any other entity, living or nonliving. He further
prayed for supremacy over the entire universe and requested the eight yogic perfections, such as anima
and laghima.
