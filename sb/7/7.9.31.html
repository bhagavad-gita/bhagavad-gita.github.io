<h2>Text</h2>
tvam va idam sadasad isa bhavams tato 'nyo
maya yad atma-para-buddhir iyam hy apartha
yad yasya janma nidhanam sthitir iksanam ca
tad vaitad eva vasukalavad asti-tarvoh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvam--You; va--either; idam--the whole universe; sat-asat--consisting of cause and effect (You are the
cause, and Your energy is the effect); isa--O my Lord, the supreme controller; bhavan--Yourself; tatah--
from the universe; anyah--separately situated (the creation is made by the Lord, yet He remains separate
from the creation); maya--the energy that appears as a separate creation; yat--of which; atma-parabuddhih--
the conception of one's own and another's; iyam--this; hi--indeed; apartha--has no meaning
(everything is Your Lordship, and therefore there is no hope for understanding "my" and "your"); yat--the
substance from which; yasya--of which; janma--creation; nidhanam--annihilation; sthitih--maintenance;
iksanam--manifestation; ca--and; tat--that; va--or; etat--this; eva--certainly; vasukala-vat--like the quality
of being the earth and, beyond that, the subtle element of the earth (smell); asti-tarvoh--the seed (the
cause) and the tree (the effect of the cause).
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, the entire cosmic creation is caused by You, and the
cosmic manifestation is an effect of Your energy. Although the entire cosmos is but You alone, You keep
Yourself aloof from it. The conception of "mine and yours," is certainly a type of illusion [maya] because
everything is an emanation from You and is therefore not different from You. Indeed, the cosmic
manifestation is nondifferent from You, and the annihilation is also caused by You. This relationship
between Your Lordship and the cosmos is illustrated by the example of the seed and the tree, or the subtle
cause and the gross manifestation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (7.10) the Lord says:
bijam mam sarva-bhutanam
viddhi partha sanatanam
"O son of Prtha, know that I am the original seed of all existences." In the Vedic literature it is said,
isavasyam idam sarvam, yato va imani bhutani jayante and sarvam khalv idam brahma. All this Vedic
information indicates that there is only one God and that there is nothing else but Him. The Mayavadi
philosophers explain this in their own way, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead asserts the truth that
He is everything and yet is separate from everything. This is the philosophy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu,
which is called acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. Everything is one, the Supreme Lord, yet everything is separate
from the Lord. This is the understanding of oneness and difference.
The example given in this regard--vasukalavad asti-tarvoh--is very easy to understand. Everything exists
in time, yet there are different phases of the time factor--present, past and future. Present, past and future
are one. Every day we can experience the time factor as morning, noon and evening, and although
morning is different from noon, which is different from evening, all of them taken together are one. The
time factor is the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord is separate from the time
factor. Everything is created, maintained and annihilated by time, but the Supreme Lord, the Personality
of Godhead, has no beginning and no end. He is nityah sasvatah--eternal, permanent. Everything passes
through time's phases of present, past and future, yet the Lord is always the same. Thus there is
undoubtedly a difference between the Lord and the cosmic manifestation, but actually they are not
different. Accepting them to be different is called avidya, ignorance.
True oneness, however, is not equivalent to the conception of the Mayavadis. The true understanding is
that the differences are manifested by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The seed is
manifested as a tree, which displays varieties in its trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. Srila
Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung, kesava tuya jagata vicitra: "My dear Lord, Your creation is full
of varieties." The varieties are one and at the same time different. This is the philosophy of acintyabhedabheda-
tattva. The conclusion given in Brahma-samhita is this:
isvarah paramah krsnah
sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah
anadir adir govindah
sarva-karana-karanam
"Krsna, known as Govinda, is the supreme controller. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is
the origin of all. He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes." Because the Lord is the
supreme cause, everything is one with Him, but when we consider varieties, we find that one thing is
different from another.
We may conclude, therefore, that there is no difference between one thing and another, yet in varieties
there are differences. In this regard, Madhvacarya gives an example concerning a tree and a tree in fire.
Both trees are the same, but they look different because of the time factor. The time factor is under the
control of the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Supreme Lord is different from time. An advanced devotee
consequently does not distinguish between happiness and distress. As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam
(10.14.8):
tat te 'nukampam susamiksamano
bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam
When a devotee is in a condition of so-called distress, he considers it a gift or blessing from the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When a devotee is always thus situated in Krsna consciousness in any condition
of life, he is described as mukti-pade sa daya-bhak, a perfect candidate for returning home, back to
Godhead. The word daya-bhak means "inheritance." A son inherits the property of his father. Similarly,
when the devotee is fully Krsna conscious, undisturbed by dualities, he is sure that he will return home,
back to Godhead, just as one inherits his father's property.
