<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
kutumba-posaya viyan nijayur
na budhyate 'rtham vihatam pramattah
sarvatra tapa-traya-duhkhitatma
nirvidyate na sva-kutumba-ramah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kutumba--of family members; posaya--for the maintenance; viyat--declining; nija-ayuh--his lifetime; na--
not; budhyate--understands; artham--the interest or purpose of life; vihatam--spoiled; pramattah--being
mad in material conditions; sarvatra--everywhere; tapa-traya--by the threefold miserable conditions
(adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibautika); duhkhita--being distressed; atma--himself; nirvidyate--
becomes remorseful; na--not; sva-kutumba-ramah--enjoying simply by maintaining the members of the
family.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who is too attached cannot understand that he is wasting his valuable life for the maintenance of
his family. He also fails to understand that the purpose of human life, a life suitable for realization of the
Absolute Truth, is being imperceptibly spoiled. However, he is very cleverly attentive to seeing that not a
single farthing is lost by mismanagement. Thus although an attached person in material existence always
suffers from threefold miseries, he does not develop a distaste for the way of material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A foolish man does not understand the values of human life, nor does he understand how he is wasting
his valuable life simply for the maintenance of his family members. He is expert in calculating the loss of
pounds, shillings and pence, but he is so foolish that he does not know how much money he is losing,
even according to material considerations. Canakya Pandita gives the example that a moment of life
cannot be purchased in exchange for millions of dollars. A foolish person, however, wastes such a
valuable life without knowing how much he is losing, even according to monetary calculations. Although
a materialistic person is expert in calculating costs and doing business, he does not realize that he is
misusing his costly life for want of knowledge. Even though such a materialistic person is always suffering
threefold miseries, he is not intelligent enough to cease his materialistic way of life.
