<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my friends, sons of demons! In this material world, even those who are apparently advanced in
education have the propensity to consider, "This is mine, and that is for others." Thus they are always
engaged in providing the necessities of life to their families in a limited conception of family life, just like
uneducated cats and dogs. They are unable to take to spiritual knowledge; instead, they are bewildered
and overcome by ignorance.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In human society there are attempts to educate the human being, but for animal society there is no such
system, nor are animals able to be educated. Therefore animals and unintelligent men are called vimudha,
or ignorant, bewildered, whereas an educated person is called vidvan. The real vidvan is one who tries to
understand his own position within this material world. For example, when Sanatana Gosvami submitted
to the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, his first question was 'ke ami', 'kene amaya jare tapa-traya'.
In other words, he wanted to know his constitutional position and why he was suffering from the
threefold miseries of material existence. This is the process of education. If one does not ask, "Who am I?
What is the goal of my life?" but instead follows the same animal propensities as cats and dogs, what is
the use of his education? As discussed in the previous verse, a living being is entrapped by his fruitive
activities, exactly like a silkworm trapped in its own cocoon. Foolish persons are generally encaged by
their fruitive actions (karma) because of a strong desire to enjoy this material world. Such attracted
persons become involved in society, community and nation and waste their time, not having profited
from having obtained human forms. Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, great leaders, politicians,
philosophers and scientists are all engaged in foolish activities, thinking, "This is mine, and this is yours."
The scientists invent nuclear weapons and collaborate with the big leaders to protect the interests of their
own nation or society. In this verse, however, it is clearly stated that despite their so-called advanced
knowledge, they actually have the same mentality as cats and dogs. As cats, dogs and other animals, not
knowing their true interest in life, become increasingly involved in ignorance, the so-called educated
person who does not know his own self-interest or the true goal of life becomes increasingly involved in
materialism. Therefore Prahlada Maharaja advises everyone to follow the principles of varnasramadharma.
Specifically, at a certain point one must give up family life and take to the renounced order of life
to cultivate spiritual knowledge and thus become liberated. This is further discussed in the following
verses.
