dharma-mulam hi bhagavan

smrtam ca tad-vidam rajan
yena catma prasidati
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharma-mulam--the root of religious principles; hi--indeed; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; sarva-veda-mayah--the essence of all Vedic knowledge; harih--the Supreme Being; smrtam ca--
and the scriptures; tat-vidam--of those who know the Supreme Lord; rajan--O King; yena--by which
(religious principle); ca--also; atma--the soul, mind, body and everything; prasidati--become fully
satisfied.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, the root of all
religious principles, and the memory of great authorities. O King Yudhisthira, this principle of religion is
to be understood as evidence. On the basis of this religious principle, everything is satisfied, including
one's mind, soul and even one's body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Yamaraja, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam. Yamaraja, the representative of the Lord
who takes care of the living beings after their death, gives his verdict as to how and when the living being
will change his body. He is the authority, and he says that the religious principles consist of the codes and
laws given by God. No one can manufacture religion, and therefore manufactured religious systems are
rejected by the followers of the Vedic principles. In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) it is said, vedais ca sarvair aham
eva vedyah: Vedic knowledge means to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.
Therefore, whether one speaks of the Vedas, scriptures, religion or the principles of everyone's
occupational duty, all of them must aim at understanding Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6) therefore concludes:
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
In other words, religious principles aim at learning how to render transcendental loving service to the
Lord. That service must be unmotivated and unchecked by material conditions. Then human society will
be happy in all respects.
The smrti, the scriptures following the principles of Vedic knowledge, are considered the evidence of
Vedic principles. There are twenty different types of scripture for following religious principles, and
among them the scriptures of Manu and Yajnavalkya are considered to be all-pervading authorities. In the
Yajnavalkya-smrti it is said:
sruti-smrti-sadacarah
svasya ca priyam atmanah
samyak sankalpajah kamo
dharma-mulam idam smrtam
One should learn human behavior from sruti, the Vedas, and from smrti, the scriptures following the
Vedic principles. Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu says:
sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-
vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
The purport is that to become a devotee one must follow the principles laid down in sruti and smrti.
One must follow the codes of the puranas and the pancaratriki-vidhi. One cannot be a pure devotee
without following the sruti and smrti, and the sruti and smrti without devotional service cannot lead one
to the perfection of life.
Therefore, from all the evidence the conclusion is that without bhakti, devotional service, there is no
question of religious principles. God is the central figure in the performance of religious principles.
Almost everything going on in this world as religion is devoid of any idea of devotional service and is
therefore condemned by the verdict of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Without devotional service, so-called religious
principles are only cheating.

<h2>Translation</h2>
These are the general principles to be followed by all human beings: truthfulness, mercy, austerity
(observing fasts on certain days of the month), bathing twice a day, tolerance, discrimination between
right and wrong, control of the mind, control of the senses, nonviolence, celibacy, charity, reading of
scripture, simplicity, satisfaction, rendering service to saintly persons, gradually taking leave of
unnecessary engagements, observing the futility of the unnecessary activities of human society, remaining
silent and grave and avoiding unnecessary talk, considering whether one is the body or the soul,
distributing food equally to all living entities (both men and animals), seeing every soul (especially in the
human form) as a part of the Supreme Lord, hearing about the activities and instructions given by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead (who is the shelter of the saintly persons), chanting about these
activities and instructions, always remembering these activities and instructions, trying to render service,
performing worship, offering obeisances, becoming a servant, becoming a friend, and surrendering one's
whole self. O King Yudhisthira, these thirty qualifications must be acquired in the human form of life.
Simply by acquiring these qualifications, one can satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In order that human beings be distinct from the animals, the great saint Narada recommends that every
human being be educated in terms of the above-mentioned thirty qualifications. Nowadays there is
propaganda everywhere, all over the world, for a secular state, a state interested only in mundane
activities. But if the citizens of the state are not educated in the above-mentioned good qualities, how can
there be happiness? For example, if the total populace is untruthful, how can the state be happy?
Therefore, without consideration of one's belonging to a sectarian religion, whether Hindu, Muslim,
Christian, Buddhist or any other sect, everyone should be taught to become truthful. Similarly, everyone
should be taught to be merciful, and everyone should observe fasting on certain days of the month.
Everyone should bathe twice a day, cleanse his teeth and body externally, and cleanse his mind internally
by remembering the holy name of the Lord. The Lord is one, whether one is Hindu, Muslim or Christian.
Therefore, one should chant the holy name of the Lord, regardless of differences in linguistic
pronunciation. Also, everyone should be taught to be very careful not to discharge semen unnecessarily.
This is very important for all human beings. If semen is not discharged unnecessarily, one becomes
extremely strong in memory, determination, activity and the vitality of one's bodily energy. Everyone
should also be taught to be simple in thought and feeling and satisfied in body and mind. These are the
general qualifications of a human being. There is no question of a secular state or an ecclesiastical state.
Unless one is educated in the above-mentioned thirty qualities, there cannot be any peace. Ultimately it is
recommended:
sravanam kirtanam casya
smaranam mahatam gateh
sevejyavanatir dasyam
sakhyam atma-samarpanam
Everyone should become a devotee of the Lord, because by becoming a devotee of the Lord one
automatically acquires the other qualities.
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna
manorathenasati dhavato bahih
"In one who has unflinching devotional service to Krsna, all the good qualities of Krsna and the
demigods are consistently manifest. However, he who has no devotion to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead has no good qualifications because he is engaged by mental concoction in material existence,
which is the external feature of the Lord." (Bhag. 5.18.12) Our Krsna consciousness movement, therefore,
is all-embracing. Human civilization should take it very seriously and practice its principles for the peace
of the world.
