<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, the root of all
religious principles, and the memory of great authorities. O King Yudhisthira, this principle of religion is
to be understood as evidence. On the basis of this religious principle, everything is satisfied, including
one's mind, soul and even one's body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated by Yamaraja, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam. Yamaraja, the representative of the Lord
who takes care of the living beings after their death, gives his verdict as to how and when the living being
will change his body. He is the authority, and he says that the religious principles consist of the codes and
laws given by God. No one can manufacture religion, and therefore manufactured religious systems are
rejected by the followers of the Vedic principles. In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) it is said, vedais ca sarvair aham
eva vedyah: Vedic knowledge means to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.
Therefore, whether one speaks of the Vedas, scriptures, religion or the principles of everyone's
occupational duty, all of them must aim at understanding Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6) therefore concludes:
sa vai pumsam paro dharmo
yato bhaktir adhoksaje
ahaituky apratihata
yayatma suprasidati
In other words, religious principles aim at learning how to render transcendental loving service to the
Lord. That service must be unmotivated and unchecked by material conditions. Then human society will
be happy in all respects.
The smrti, the scriptures following the principles of Vedic knowledge, are considered the evidence of
Vedic principles. There are twenty different types of scripture for following religious principles, and
among them the scriptures of Manu and Yajnavalkya are considered to be all-pervading authorities. In the
Yajnavalkya-smrti it is said:
sruti-smrti-sadacarah
svasya ca priyam atmanah
samyak sankalpajah kamo
dharma-mulam idam smrtam
One should learn human behavior from sruti, the Vedas, and from smrti, the scriptures following the
Vedic principles. Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu says:
sruti-smrti-puranadipancaratra-
vidhim vina
aikantiki harer bhaktir
utpatayaiva kalpate
The purport is that to become a devotee one must follow the principles laid down in sruti and smrti.
One must follow the codes of the puranas and the pancaratriki-vidhi. One cannot be a pure devotee
without following the sruti and smrti, and the sruti and smrti without devotional service cannot lead one
to the perfection of life.
Therefore, from all the evidence the conclusion is that without bhakti, devotional service, there is no
question of religious principles. God is the central figure in the performance of religious principles.
Almost everything going on in this world as religion is devoid of any idea of devotional service and is
therefore condemned by the verdict of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Without devotional service, so-called religious
principles are only cheating.
