<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, devotees like your good self are verily holy places personified. Because you carry the
Personality of Godhead within your heart, you turn all places into places of pilgrimage.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Personality of Godhead is omnipresent by His diverse potencies everywhere, just as the power of
electricity is distributed everywhere within space. Similarly, the Lord's omnipresence is perceived and
manifested by His unalloyed devotees like Vidura, just as electricity is manifested in an electric bulb. A
pure devotee like Vidura always feels the presence of the Lord everywhere. He sees everything in the
potency of the Lord and the Lord in everything. The holy places all over the earth are meant for purifying
the polluted consciousness of the human being by an atmosphere surcharged with the presence of the
Lord's unalloyed devotees. If anyone visits a holy place, he must search out the pure devotees residing in
such holy places, take lessons from them, try to apply such instructions in practical life and thus gradually
prepare oneself for the ultimate salvation, going back to Godhead. To go to some holy place of pilgrimage
does not mean only to take a bath in the Ganges or Yamuna or to visit the temples situated in those
places. One should also find representatives of Vidura who have no desire in life save and except to serve
the Personality of Godhead. The Personality of Godhead is always with such pure devotees because of
their unalloyed service, which is without any tinge of fruitive action or utopian speculation. They are in
the actual service of the Lord, specifically by the process of hearing and chanting. The pure devotees hear
from the authorities and chant, sing and write of the glories of the Lord. Mahamuni Vyasadeva heard from
Narada, and then he chanted in writing; Sukadeva Gosvami studied from his father, and he described it to
Pariksit; that is the way of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So by their actions the pure devotees of the Lord can
render any place into a place of pilgrimage, and the holy places are worth the name only on their account.
Such pure devotees are able to rectify the polluted atmosphere of any place, and what to speak of a holy
place rendered unholy by the questionable actions of interested persons who try to adopt a professional
life at the cost of the reputation of a holy place.
