<h2>Translation</h2>
Remembering Lord Krsna and His well-wishes, benefactions, intimate familial relations and His chariot
driving, Arjuna, overwhelmed and breathing very heavily, began to speak.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Living Being is perfect in all relations with His pure devotee. Sri Arjuna is one of the
typical pure devotees of the Lord reciprocating in the fraternal relationship, and the Lord's dealings with
Arjuna are displays of friendship of the highest perfect order. He was not only a well-wisher of Arjuna but
actually a benefactor, and to make it still more perfect the Lord tied him into a family relationship by
arranging Subhadra's marriage with him. And above all, the Lord agreed to become a chariot driver of
Arjuna in order to protect His friend from warfare risks, and the Lord became actually happy when He
established the Pandavas to rule over the world. Arjuna remembered all these one after another, and thus
he became overwhelmed with such thoughts.
