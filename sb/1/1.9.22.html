<h2>Text</h2>
tathapy ekanta-bhaktesu
pasya bhupanukampitam
yan me 'sums tyajatah saksat
krsno darsanam agatah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tathapi--still; ekanta--unflinching; bhaktesu--unto the devotees; pasya--see here; bhu-pa--O King;
anukampitam--how sympathetic; yat--for which; me--my; asun--life; tyajatah--ending; saksat--directly;
krsnah--the Personality of Godhead; darsanam--in my view; agatah--has kindly come.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Yet, despite His being equally kind to everyone, He has graciously come before me while I am ending
my life, for I am His unflinching servitor.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, although equal to everyone, is still
more inclined to His unflinching devotee who is completely surrendered and knows no one else as his
protector and master. Having unflinching faith in the Supreme Lord as one's protector, friend and master
is the natural condition of eternal life. A living entity is so made by the will of the Almighty that he is
most happy when placing himself in a condition of absolute dependence.
The opposite tendency is the cause of falldown. The living entity has this tendency of falling down by
dint of misidentifying himself as fully independent to lord it over the material world. The root cause of all
troubles is there in false egotism. One must draw towards the Lord in all circumstances.
The appearance of Lord Krsna at the deathbed of Bhismaji is due to his being an unflinching devotee of
the Lord. Arjuna had some bodily relation with Krsna because the Lord happened to be his maternal
cousin. But Bhisma had no such bodily relation. Therefore the cause of attraction was due to the intimate
relation of the soul. Yet because the relation of the body is very pleasing and natural, the Lord is more
pleased when He is addressed as the son of Maharaja Nanda, the son of Yasoda, the lover of Radharani.
This affinity by bodily relation with the Lord is another feature of reciprocating loving service with the
Lord. Bhismadeva is conscious of this sweetness of transcendental humor, and therefore he likes to
address the Lord as Vijaya-Sakhe, Partha-Sakhe, etc., exactly like Nanda-nandana or Yasoda-nandana. The
best way to establish our relation in transcendental sweetness is to approach Him through His recognized
devotees. One should not try to establish the relation directly; there must be a via medium which is
transparent and competent to lead us to the right path.
