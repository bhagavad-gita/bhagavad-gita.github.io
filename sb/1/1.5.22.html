<h2>Translation</h2>
Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge,
namely austerities, study of the Vedas, sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the
transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics,
chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By culture of such knowledge the human society can
attain perfection of life. This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being, Visnu.
The sruti therefore directs that those who are actually advanced in learning should aspire for the service
of Lord Visnu. Unfortunately persons who are enamored by the external beauty of visnu-maya do not
understand that culmination of perfection or self-realization depends on Visnu. Visnu-maya means sense
enjoyment, which is transient and miserable. Those who are entrapped by visnu-maya utilize
advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. Sri Narada Muni has explained that all paraphernalia of
the cosmic universe is but an emanation from the Lord out of His different energies because the Lord has
set in motion, by His inconceivable energy, the actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They
have come to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation they merge into Him.
Nothing is, therefore, different from Him, but at the same time the Lord is always different from them.
When advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord, the whole process becomes
absolute. The Personality of Godhead and His transcendental name, fame, glory, etc., are all nondifferent
from Him. Therefore, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of
art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology and all other branches of knowledge should be
wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc., may be used in
glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers, poets and celebrated litterateurs are generally engaged in writing
of sensuous subjects, but if they turn towards the service of the Lord they can describe the transcendental
pastimes of the Lord. Valmiki was a great poet, and similarly Vyasadeva is a great writer, and both of them
have absolutely engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord and by doing
so have become immortal. Similarly, science and philosophy also should be applied in the service of the
Lord. There is no use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. philosophy and science
should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced people are eager to understand the
Absolute Truth through the medium of science, and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove
the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical speculations should be utilized to
establish the Supreme Truth as sentient and all-powerful. Similarly, all other branches of knowledge
should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita also the same is affirmed. All
"knowledge" not engaged in the service of the Lord is but nescience. Real utilization of advanced
knowledge is to establish the glories of the Lord, and that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged
in the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factually hari-kirtana, or glorification of the Lord.
