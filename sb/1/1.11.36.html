<h2>Translation</h2>
Although the queens' beautiful smiles and furtive glances were all spotless and exciting, and although
they could conquer Cupid himself by making him give up his bow in frustration, and although even the
tolerant Siva could fall victim to them, still, despite all their magical feats and attractions, they could not
agitate the senses of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The path of salvation or the path going back to Godhead always forbids the association of women, and
the complete sanatana-dharma or varnasrama-dharma scheme forbids or restricts association with women.
How, then, can one be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is addicted to more than
sixteen thousand wives? This question may be relevantly raised by inquisitive persons really anxious to
know about the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord. And to answer such questions, the sages at
Naimisaranya have discussed the transcendental character of the Lord in this and in following verses. It is
clear herein that the feminine attractive features which can conquer Cupid or even the supermost tolerant
Lord Siva could not conquer the senses of the Lord. Cupid's business is to invoke mundane lust. The
whole universe is moving being agitated by Cupid's arrow. The activities of the world are being carried on
by the central attraction of male and female. A male is searching after a mate to his liking, and the female
is looking after a suitable male. That is the way of material stimulus. And as soon as a male is combined
with a female, the material bondage of the living being is at once tightly interlocked by sex relation, and as
a result of this, both the male's and female's attraction for sweet home, motherland, bodily offspring,
society and friendship and accumulation of wealth becomes the illusory field of activities, and thus a false
but indefatigable attraction for the temporary material existence, which is full of miseries, is manifest.
Those who are, therefore, on the path of salvation for going back home back to Godhead, are especially
advised by all scriptural instruction to become free from such paraphernalia of material attraction. And
that is possible only by the association of the devotees of the Lord, who are called the mahatmas. Cupid
throws his arrow upon the living beings to make them mad after the opposite sex, whether the party is
actually beautiful or not. Cupid's provocations are going on, even among beastly societies who are all
ugly-looking in the estimation of the civilized nations. Thus Cupid's influence is exerted even amongst
the ugliest forms, and what to speak of the most perfect beauties. Lord Siva, who is considered to be most
tolerant, was also struck by Cupid's arrow because he also became mad after the Mohini incarnation of the
Lord and acknowledged himself to be defeated. Cupid, however, was himself captivated by the grave and
exciting dealings of the goddesses of fortune, and he voluntarily gave up his bow and arrow in a spirit of
frustration. Such was the beauty and attraction of the queens of Lord Krsna. Yet they could not disturb the
transcendental senses of the Lord. This is because the Lord is all-perfect atmarama, or self-sufficient. He
does not require anyone's extraneous help for His personal satisfaction. Therefore, the queens could not
satisfy the Lord by their feminine attractiveness, but they satisfied Him by their sincere affection and
service. Only by unalloyed transcendental loving service could they satisfy the Lord, and the Lord was
pleased to treat them as wives in reciprocation. Thus being satisfied by their unalloyed service only, the
Lord reciprocated the service just like a devout husband. Otherwise He had no business becoming the
husband of so many wives. He is the husband of everyone, but to one who accepts Him as such, He
reciprocates. This unalloyed affection for the Lord is never to be compared to mundane lust. It is purely
transcendental. And the grave dealings, which the queens displayed in natural feminine ways, were also
transcendental because the feelings were expressed out of transcendental ecstasy. It is already explained in
the previous verse that the Lord appeared like a mundane husband, but factually His relation with His
wives was transcendental, pure and unconditioned by the modes of material nature.
