<h2>Translation</h2>
[The sages said:] O chief of all the saintly kings of the Pandu dynasty who are strictly in the line of Lord
Sri Krsna! It is not at all astonishing that you give up your throne, which is decorated with the helmets of
many kings, to achieve eternal association with the Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Foolish politicians who hold political administrative posts think that the temporary posts they occupy
are the highest material gain of life, and therefore they stick to those posts even up to the last moment of
life, without knowing that achievement of liberation as one of the associates of the Lord in His eternal
abode is the highest gain of life. The human life is meant for achieving this end. The Lord has assured us
in the Bhagavad-gita many times that going back to Godhead, His eternal abode, is the highest
achievement. Prahlada Maharaja, while praying to Lord Nrsimha, said, "O my Lord, I am very much afraid
of the materialistic way of life, and I am not the least afraid of Your present ghastly ferocious feature as
Nrsimhadeva. This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stone, and we are being crushed
by it. We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the tossing waves of life, and thus, my Lord, I pray at
Your lotus feet to call me back to Your eternal abode as one of Your servitors. This is the summit
liberation of this materialistic way of life. I have very bitter experience of the materialistic way of life. In
whichever species of life I have taken birth, compelled by the force of my own activities, I have very
painfully experienced two things, namely separation from my beloved and meeting with what is not
wanted. And to counteract them, the remedies which I undertook were more dangerous than the disease
itself. So I drift from one point to another birth after birth, and I pray to You therefore to give me a shelter
at Your lotus feet."
The Pandava kings, who are more than many saints of the world, knew the bitter results of the
materialistic way of life. They were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupied, and
they sought always the opportunity of being called by the Lord to associate with Him eternally. Maharaja
Pariksit was the worthy grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira. Maharaja Yudhisthira gave up the imperial
throne to his grandson, and similarly Maharaja Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira, gave up
the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya. That is the way of all the kings in the dynasty because they are
all strictly in the line of Lord Krsna. Thus the devotees of the Lord are never enchanted by the glare of
materialistic life, and they live impartially, unattached to the objects of the false, illusory materialistic way
of life.
