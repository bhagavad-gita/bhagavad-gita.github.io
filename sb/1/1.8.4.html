<h2>Translation</h2>
Citing the stringent laws of the Almighty and their reactions upon living beings, Lord Sri Krsna and the
munis began to pacify those who were shocked and affected.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The stringent laws of nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot be altered
by any living entity. The living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the almighty Lord. The Lord
makes all the laws and orders, and these laws and orders are generally called dharma or religion. No one
can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord's orders
are clearly declared in the Bhagavad-gita. Everyone should follow Him only or His orders, and that will
make all happy, both materially and spiritually. As long as we are in the material world, our duty is to
follow the orders of the Lord, and if by the grace of the Lord we are liberated from the clutches of the
material world, then in our liberated stage also we can render transcendental loving service unto the Lord.
In our material stage we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. But when we
are liberated from material affection and are situated in our original spiritual form we can see both
ourselves and the Lord face to face. Mukti means to be reinstated in one's original spiritual status after
giving up the material conception of life. Therefore, human life is specifically meant for qualifying
ourselves for this spiritual liberty. Unfortunately, under the influence of illusory material energy, we
accept this spot-life of only a few years as our permanent existence and thus become illusioned by
possessing so-called country, home, land, children, wife, community, wealth, etc., which are false
representations created by maya (illusion). And under the dictation of maya, we fight with one another to
protect these false possessions. By cultivating spiritual knowledge, we can realize that we have nothing to
do with all this material paraphernalia. Then at once we become free from material attachment. This
clearance of the misgivings of material existence at once takes place by association with the Lord's
devotees, who are able to inject the transcendental sound into the depths of the bewildered heart and thus
make one practically liberated from all lamentation and illusion. That is a summary of the pacifying
measures for those affected by the reaction of stringent material laws, exhibited in the forms of birth,
death, old age and disease, which are insoluble factors of material existence. The victims of war, namely,
the family members of the Kurus, were lamenting the problems of death, and the Lord pacified them on
the basis of knowledge.
