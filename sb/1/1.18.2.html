<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
brahma-kopotthitad yas tu
taksakat prana-viplavat
na sammumohorubhayad
bhagavaty arpitasayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahma-kopa--fury of a brahmana; utthitat--caused by; yah--what was; tu--but; taksakat--by the snakebird;
prana-viplavat--from dissolution of life; na--never; sammumoha--was overwhelmed; uru-bhayat--
great fear; bhagavati--unto the Personality of Godhead; arpita--surrendered; asayah--consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Furthermore, Maharaja Pariksit was always consciously surrendered to the Personality of Godhead, and
therefore he was neither afraid nor overwhelmed by fear due to a snake-bird which was to bite him
because of the fury of a brahmana boy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A self-surrendered devotee of the Lord is called narayana-parayana. Such a person is never afraid of any
place or person, not even of death. For him nothing is as important as the Supreme Lord, and thus he
gives equal importance to heaven and hell. He knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the
Lord, and similarly life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord. But in all
conditions and in all circumstances, remembrance of Narayana is essential. The narayana-parayana
practices this constantly. Maharaja Pariksit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an
inexperienced son of a brahmana, who was under the influence of Kali, and Maharaja Pariksit took this to
be sent by Narayana. He knew that Narayana (Lord Krsna) had saved him when he was burned in the
womb of his mother, and if he were to be killed by a snake bite, it would also take place by the will of the
Lord. The devotee never goes against the will of the Lord; anything sent by God is a blessing for the
devotee. Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was neither afraid of nor bewildered by such things. That is the sign
of a pure devotee of the Lord.
