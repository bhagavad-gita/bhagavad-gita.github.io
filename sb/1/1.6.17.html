TRANSLATION
One who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may
sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the
other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.
PURPORT
As far as the duties of mankind are concerned, there are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound
not only to his parents, family members, society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods,
etc., but also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists, etc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can
relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes
successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But it so happens
sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentiment, and in
the long run, due to so many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable
association. There are so many instances of this in the histories. Bharata Maharaja was obliged to take his
birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in
the next birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incident of his previous birth. Similarly,
Citraketu also fell down due to his offenses at the feet of Siva. But in spite of all this, the stress is given
here to surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lord, even if there is a chance of falling down, because even
though one falls down from the prescribed duties of devotional service, he will never forget the lotus feet
of the Lord. Once engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, one will continue the service in all
circumstances. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that even a small quantity of devotional service can save one
from the most dangerous position. There are many instances of such examples in history. Ajamila is one
of them. Ajamila in his early life was a devotee, but in his youth he fell down. Still he was saved by the
Lord at the end.
