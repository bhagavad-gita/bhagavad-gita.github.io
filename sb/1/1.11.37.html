<h2>Text</h2>
tam ayam manyate loko
hy asangam api sanginam
atmaupamyena manujam
vyaprnvanam yato 'budhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--unto Lord Krsna; ayam--all these (common men); manyate--do speculate within the mind; lokah--
the conditioned souls; hi--certainly; asangam--unattached; api--in spite of; sanginam--affected; atma--self;
aupamyena--by comparison with the self; manujam--ordinary man; vyaprnvanam--being engaged in;
yatah--because; abudhah--foolish because of ignorance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The common materialistic conditioned souls speculate that the Lord is one of them. Out of their
ignorance they think that the Lord is affected by matter, although He is unattached.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word abudhah is significant here. Due to ignorance only, the foolish mundane wranglers
misunderstand the Supreme Lord and spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by
propaganda. The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna is the original primeval Personality of Godhead, and when He
was personally present before the eyes of everyone, He displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field
of activities. As we have already explained in the first verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam, He is completely
independent to act however He likes, but all His actions are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. Only the
foolish mundaners misunderstand Him, unaware of His eternal form of knowledge and bliss, which is
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita and Upanisads. His different potencies work in a perfect plan of natural
sequence, and doing everything by the agency of His different potencies, He remains eternally the
supreme independent. When He descends on the material world by His causeless mercy to different living
beings, He does so by His own potency. He is not subject to any condition of the material modes of
nature, and He descends as He is originally. The mental speculators misunderstand Him as the Supreme
Person, and they consider His impersonal features as inexplicable Brahman to be all. Such a conception is
also the product of conditioned life because they cannot go beyond their own personal capacity.
Therefore, one who considers the Lord on the level of one's limited potency is only a common man. Such
a man cannot be convinced that the Personality of Godhead is always unaffected by the modes of material
nature. He cannot understand that the sun is always unaffected by infectious matter. The mental
speculators compare everything from the standpoint of experimental knowledge of their own selves. Thus
when the Lord is found to act like an ordinary person in matrimonial bondage, they consider Him to be
like one of them, without considering that the Lord can at once marry sixteen thousand wives or more.
Due to a poor fund of knowledge they accept one side of the picture while disbelieving the other. This
means that due to ignorance only they always think of Lord Krsna as like themselves and make their own
conclusions, which are absurd and unauthentic from the version of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
