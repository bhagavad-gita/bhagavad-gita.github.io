<h2>Text</h2>
anyatha te 'vyakta-gater
darsanam nah katham nrnam
nitaram mriyamananam
samsiddhasya vaniyasah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anyatha--otherwise; te--your; avyakta-gateh--of one whose movements are invisible; darsanam--meeting;
nah--for us; katham--how; nrnam--of the people; nitaram--specifically; mriyamananam--of those who are
about to die; samsiddhasya--of one who is all-perfect; vaniyasah--voluntary appearance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Otherwise [without being inspired by Lord Krsna] how is it that you have voluntarily appeared here,
though you are moving incognito to the common man and are not visible to us who are on the verge of
death?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great sage Sukadeva Gosvami was certainly inspired by Lord Krsna to appear voluntarily before
Maharaja Pariksit, the great devotee of the Lord, just to give him the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
One can achieve the nucleus of the devotional service of the Lord by the mercy of the spiritual master and
the Personality of Godhead. The spiritual master is the manifested representative of the Lord to help one
achieve ultimate success. One who is not authorized by the Lord cannot become a spiritual master. Srila
Sukadeva Gosvami is an authorized spiritual master, and thus he was inspired by the Lord to appear
before Maharaja Pariksit and instruct him in the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam. One can achieve the
ultimate success of going back to Godhead if he is favored by the Lord's sending His true representative.
As soon as a true representative of the Lord is met by a devotee of the Lord, the devotee is assured a
guarantee for going back to Godhead just after leaving the present body. This, however, depends on the
sincerity of the devotee himself. The Lord is seated in the heart of all living beings, and thus he knows
very well the movements of all individual persons. As soon as the Lord finds that a particular soul is very
eager to go back to Godhead, the Lord at once sends His bona fide representative. The sincere devotee is
thus assured by the Lord of going back to Godhead. The conclusion is that to get the assistance and help
of a bona fide spiritual master means to receive the direct help of the Lord Himself.
