<h2>Text</h2>
iti putra-krtaghena
so 'nutapto maha-munih
svayam viprakrto rajna
naivagham tad acintayat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; putra--son; krta--done by; aghena--by the sin; sah--he (the muni); anutaptah--regretting;
maha-munih--the sage; svayam--personally; viprakrtah--being so insulted; rajna--by the King; na--not;
eva--certainly; agham--the sin; tat--that; acintayat--thought of it.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage thus regretted the sin committed by his own son. He did not take the insult paid by the King
very seriously.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole incident is now cleared up. Maharaja Pariksit's garlanding the sage with a dead snake was not
at all a very serious offense, but Srngi's cursing the King was a serious offense. The serious offense was
committed by a foolish child only; therefore he deserved to be pardoned by the Supreme Lord, although it
was not possible to get free from the sinful reaction. Maharaja Pariksit also did not mind the curse offered
to him by a foolish brahmana. On the contrary, he took full advantage of the awkward situation, and by
the great will of the Lord, Maharaja Pariksit achieved the highest perfection of life through the grace of
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami. Actually it was the desire of the Lord, and Maharaja Pariksit, Rsi Samika and his
son Srngi were all instrumental in fulfilling the desire of the Lord. So none of them were put into
difficulty because everything was done in relation with the Supreme Person.
