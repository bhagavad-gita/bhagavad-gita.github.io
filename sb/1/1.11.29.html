TRANSLATION
The children of these ladies are Pradyumna, Samba, Amba, etc: Ladies like Rukmini, Satyabhama and
Jambavati were forcibly taken away by Him from their svayamvara ceremonies after He defeated many
powerful kings, headed by Sisupala. And other ladies were also forcibly taken away by Him after He killed
Bhaumasura and thousands of his assistants. All of these ladies are glorious.
PURPORT
Exceptionally qualified daughters of powerful kings were allowed to make a choice of their own
bridegrooms in open competition, and such ceremonies were called svayamvara, or selection of the
bridegroom. Because the svayamvara was an open competition between the rival and valiant princes, such
princes were invited by the father of the princess, and usually there were regular fights between the
invited princely order in a sporting spirit. But it so happened that sometimes the belligerent princes were
killed in such marriage-fighting, and the victorious prince was offered the trophy princess for whom so
many princes died. Rukmini, the principal queen of Lord Krsna, was the daughter of the King of
Vidarbha, who wished that his qualified and beautiful daughter be given away to Lord Krsna. But her
eldest brother wanted her to be given away to King Sisupala, who happened to be a cousin of Krsna. So
there was open competition, and as usual Lord Krsna emerged successful, after harassing Sisupala and
other princes by His unrivalled prowess. Rukmini had ten sons, like Pradyumna. There were other queens
also taken away by Lord Krsna in a similar way. Full description of this beautiful booty of Lord Krsna will
be given in the Tenth Canto. There were 16,100 beautiful girls who were daughters of many kings and
were forcibly stolen by Bhaumasura, who kept them captive for his carnal desire. These girls prayed
piteously to Lord Krsna for their deliverance, and the merciful Lord, called by their fervent prayer,
released them all by fighting and killing Bhaumasura. All these captive princesses were then accepted by
the Lord as His wives, although in the estimation of society they were all fallen girls. The all-powerful
Lord Krsna accepted the humble prayers of these girls and married them with the adoration of queens. So
altogether Lord Krsna had 16,108 queens at Dvaraka, and in each of them He begot ten children. All these
children grew up, and each had as many children as the father. The aggregate of the family numbered
10,000,000.
