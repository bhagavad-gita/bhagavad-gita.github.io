<h2>Text</h2>
mrgendra iva vikranto
nisevyo himavan iva
titiksur vasudhevasau
sahisnuh pitarav iva
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mrgendrah--the lion; iva--like; vikrantah--powerful; nisevyah--worthy of taking shelter; himavan--the
Himalaya Mountains; iva--like; titiksuh--forbearance; vasudha iva--like the earth; asau--the child;
sahisnuh--tolerant; pitarau--parents; iva--like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This child will be as strong as a lion, and as worthy a shelter as the Himalaya Mountains. He will be
forbearing like the earth, and as tolerant as his parents.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One is compared to the lion when one is very strong in chasing an enemy. One should be a lamb at
home and a lion in the chase. The lion never fails in the chase of an animal; similarly, the head of the state
should never fail in chasing an enemy. The Himalaya Mountains are famous for all richness. There are
innumerable caves to live in, numberless trees of good fruits to eat, good springs to drink water from and
profuse drugs and minerals to cure diseases. Any man who is not materially prosperous can take shelter of
these great mountains, and he will be provided with everything required. Both the materialist and the
spiritualist can take advantage of the great shelter of the Himalayas. On the surface of the earth there are
so many disturbances caused by the inhabitants. In the modern age the people have begun to detonate
atomic weapons on the surface of the earth, and still the earth is forbearing to the inhabitants, like a
mother who excuses a little child. Parents are always tolerant to children for all sorts of mischievous acts.
An ideal king may be possessed of all these good qualities, and the child Pariksit is foretold to have all
these qualities in perfection.
