<h2>Translation</h2>
The transcendental Personality of Godhead is indirectly associated with the three modes of material
nature, namely passion, goodness and ignorance, and just for the material world's creation, maintenance
and destruction He accepts the three qualitative forms of Brahma, Visnu and Siva. Of these three, all
human beings can derive ultimate benefit from Visnu, the form of the quality of goodness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That Lord Sri Krsna, by His plenary parts, should be rendered devotional service, as explained above, is
confirmed by this statement. Lord Sri Krsna and all His plenary parts are visnu-tattva, or the Lordship of
Godhead. From Sri Krsna, the next manifestation is Baladeva. From Baladeva is Sankarsana, from
Sankarsana is Narayana, from Narayana there is the second Sankarsana, and from this Sankarsana the
Visnu purusa-avataras. The Visnu or the Deity of the quality of goodness in the material world is the
purusa-avatara known as Ksirodakasayi Visnu or Paramatma. Brahma is the deity of rajas (passion), and
Siva of ignorance. They are the three departmental heads of the three qualities of this material world.
Creation is made possible by the goodness of Visnu, and when it requires to be destroyed, Lord Siva does
it by the tandavanrtya. The materialists and the foolish human beings worship Brahma and Siva
respectively. But the pure transcendentalists worship the form of goodness, Visnu, in His various forms.
Visnu is manifested by His millions and billions of integrated forms and separated forms. The integrated
forms are called Godhead, and the separated forms are called the living entities or the jivas. Both the jivas
and Godhead have their original spiritual forms. Jivas are sometimes subjected to the control of material
energy, but the Visnu forms are always controllers of this energy. When Visnu, the Personality of
Godhead, appears in the material world, He comes to deliver the conditioned living beings who are under
the material energy. Such living beings appear in the material world with intentions of being lords, and
thus they become entrapped by the three modes of nature. As such, the living entities have to change their
material coverings for undergoing different terms of imprisonment. The prison house of the material
world is created by Brahma under instruction of the Personality of Godhead, and at the conclusion of a
kalpa the whole thing is destroyed by Siva. But as far as maintenance of the prison house is concerned, it
is done by Visnu, as much as the state prison house is maintained by the state. Anyone, therefore, who
wishes to get out of this prison house of material existence, which is full of miseries like repetition of
birth, death, disease and old age, must please Lord Visnu for such liberation. Lord Visnu is worshiped by
devotional service only, and if anyone has to continue prison life in the material world, he may ask for
relative facilities for temporary relief from the different demigods like Siva, Brahma, Indra and Varuna. No
demigod, however, can release the imprisoned living being from the conditioned life of material existence.
This can be done only by Visnu. Therefore, the ultimate benefit may be derived from Visnu, the
Personality of Godhead.
