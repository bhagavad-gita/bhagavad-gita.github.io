<h2>Text</h2>
karmany asminn anasvase
dhuma-dhumratmanam bhavan
apayayati govindapada-
padmasavam madhu
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
karmani--performance of; asmin--in this; anasvase--without certainty; dhuma--smoke; dhumraatmanam--
tinged body and mind; bhavan--your good self; apayayati--very much pleasing; govinda--the
Personality of Godhead; pada--feet; padma-asavam--nectar of the lotus flower; madhu--honey.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We have just begun the performance of this fruitive activity, a sacrificial fire, without certainty of its
result due to the many imperfections in our action. Our bodies have become black from the smoke, but
we are factually pleased by the nectar of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, Govinda, which you
are distributing.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The sacrificial fire kindled by the sages of Naimisaranya was certainly full of smoke and doubts because
of so many flaws. The first flaw is that there is an acute scarcity of expert brahmanas able to carry out
such performances successfully in this age of Kali. Any discrepancy in such sacrifices spoils the whole
show, and the result is uncertain, like agricultural enterprises. The good result of tilling the paddy field
depends on providential rain, and therefore the result is uncertain. Similarly, performance of any kind of
sacrifice in this age of Kali is also uncertain. Unscrupulous greedy brahmanas of the age of Kali induce the
innocent public to such uncertain sacrificial shows without disclosing the scriptural injunction that in the
age of Kali there is no fruitful sacrificial performance but the sacrifice of the congregational chanting of
the holy name of the Lord. Suta Gosvami was narrating the transcendental activities of the Lord before the
congregation of sages, and they were factually perceiving the result of hearing these transcendental
activities. One can feel this practically, as one can feel the result of eating food. Spiritual realization acts in
that way.
The sages of Naimisaranya were practically sufferers from the smoke of a sacrificial fire and were
doubtful about the result, but by hearing from a realized person like Suta Gosvami, they were fully
satisfied. In the Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Visnu tells Siva that in the age of Kali, men full of anxieties of
various kinds can vainly labor in fruitive activity and philosophical speculations, but when they are
engaged in devotional service, the result is sure and certain, and there is no loss of energy. In other words,
nothing performed for spiritual realization or for material benefit can be successful without the devotional
service to the Lord.
