<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
vyasanam viksya tat tesam
ananya-visayatmanam
sudarsanena svastrena
svanam raksam vyadhad vibhuh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vyasanam--great danger; viksya--having observed; tat--that; tesam--their; ananya--no other; visaya--
means; atmanam--thus inclined; sudarsanena--by the wheel of Sri Krsna; sva-astrena--by the weapon;
svanam--of His own devotees; raksam--protection; vyadhat--did it; vibhuh--the Almighty.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The almighty Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, having observed that a great danger was befalling His
unalloyed devotees, who were fully surrendered souls, at once took up His Sudarsana disc to protect
them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The brahmastra, the supreme weapon released by Asvatthama, was something similar to the nuclear
weapon but with more radiation and heat. This brahmastra is the product of a more subtle science, being
the product of a finer sound, a mantra recorded in the Vedas. Another advantage of this weapon is that it
is not blind like the nuclear weapon because it can be directed only to the target and nothing else.
Asvatthama released the weapon just to finish all the male members of Pandu's family; therefore in one
sense it was more dangerous than the atomic bombs because it could penetrate even the most protected
place and would never miss the target. Knowing all this, Lord Sri Krsna at once took up His personal
weapon to protect His devotees, who did not know anyone other than Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita the
Lord has clearly promised that His devotees are never to be vanquished. And He behaves according to the
quality or degree of the devotional service rendered by the devotees. Here the word ananya-visayatmanam
is significant. The Pandavas were cent percent dependent on the protection of the Lord, although they
were all great warriors themselves. But the Lord neglects even the greatest warriors and also vanquishes
them in no time. When the Lord saw that there was no time for the Pandavas to counteract the
brahmastra of Asvatthama, He took up His weapon even at the risk of breaking His own vow. Although
the Battle of Kuruksetra was almost finished, still, according to His vow, He should not have taken up His
own weapon. But the emergency was more important than the vow. He is better known as the bhaktavatsala,
or the lover of His devotee, and thus He preferred to continue as bhakta-vatsala than to be a
worldly moralist who never breaks his solemn vow.
