<h2>Text</h2>
janmaisvarya-sruta-sribhir
edhamana-madah puman
naivarhaty abhidhatum vai

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
janma--birth; aisvarya--opulence; sruta--education; sribhih--by the possession of beauty; edhamana--
progressively increasing; madah--intoxication; puman--the human being; na--never; eva--ever; arhati--
deserves; abhidhatum--to address in feeling; vai--certainly; tvam--You; akincana-gocaram--one who is
approached easily by the materially exhausted man.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by those who are materially exhausted. One
who is on the path of [material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great
opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere feeling.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Being materially advanced means taking birth in an aristocratic family and possessing great wealth, an
education and attractive personal beauty. All materialistic men are mad after possessing all these material
opulences, and this is known as the advancement of material civilization. But the result is that by
possessing all these material assets one becomes artificially puffed up, intoxicated by such temporary
possessions. Consequently, such materially puffed up persons are incapable of uttering the holy name of
the Lord by addressing Him feelingly, "O Govinda, O Krsna." It is said in the sastras that by once uttering
the holy name of the Lord, the sinner gets rid of a quantity of sins that he is unable to commit. Such is the
power of uttering the holy name of the Lord. There is not the least exaggeration in this statement.
Actually the Lord's holy name has such powerful potency. But there is a quality to such utterances also. It
depends on the quality of feeling. A helpless man can feelingly utter the holy name of the Lord, whereas a
man who utters the same holy name in great material satisfaction cannot be so sincere. A materially
puffed up person may utter the holy name of the Lord occasionally, but he is incapable of uttering the
name in quality. Therefore, the four principles of material advancement, namely (1) high parentage, (2)
good wealth, (3) high education and (4) attractive beauty, are, so to speak, disqualifications for progress
on the path of spiritual advancement. The material covering of the pure spirit soul is an external feature,
as much as fever is an external feature of the unhealthy body. The general process is to decrease the
degree of the fever and not to aggravate it by maltreatment. Sometimes it is seen that spiritually advanced
persons become materially impoverished. This is no discouragement. On the other hand, such
impoverishment is a good sign as much as the falling of temperature is a good sign. The principle of life
should be to decrease the degree of material intoxication which leads one to be more and more illusioned
about the aim of life. Grossly illusioned persons are quite unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God.
