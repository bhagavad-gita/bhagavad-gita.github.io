<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Upon hearing of Lord Krsna's returning to His abode, and upon understanding the end of the Yadu
dynasty's earthly manifestation, Maharaja Yudhisthira decided to go back home, back to Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira also turned his attention to the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita after hearing
about the Lord's departure from the vision of earthly people. He began to deliberate on the Lord's way of
appearance and departure. The mission of the Lord's appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe
is completely dependent on His supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior
energy, as the living beings appear and disappear, being forced by the laws of nature. Whenever the Lord
likes, He can appear Himself from anywhere and everywhere without disturbing His appearance and
disappearance in any other place. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at
any place without disturbing its presence in other places. The sun appears in the morning in India
without disappearing from the Western Hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all
over the solar system, but it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also
disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concern, and so
what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is the creator and controller of the sun. Therefore, in the
Bhagavad-gita it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and
disappearance of the Lord by His inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death
and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaikuntha planets are. There such liberated persons
can eternally live without the pangs of birth, death, old age and disease. In the spiritual sky the Lord and
those who are eternally engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are all eternally young
because there is no old age and disease and there is no death. Because there is no death there is no birth.
It is concluded, therefore, that simply by understanding the Lord's appearance and disappearance in truth,
one can attain the perfectional stage of eternal life. Therefore, Maharaja Yudhisthira also began to consider
going back to Godhead. The Lord appears on the earth or any other mortal planet along with His
associates who live with Him eternally, and the members of the Yadu family who were engaged in
supplementing the pastimes of the Lord are no other than His eternal associates, and so also Maharaja
Yudhisthira and his brothers and mother, etc. Since the appearance and disappearance of the Lord and His
eternal associates are transcendental, one should not be bewildered by the external features of appearance
and disappearance.
