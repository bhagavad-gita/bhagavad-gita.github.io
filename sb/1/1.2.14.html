<h2>Text</h2>
tasmad ekena manasa
bhagavan satvatam patih
srotavyah kirtitavyas ca
dhyeyah pujyas ca nityada
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--therefore; ekena--by one; manasa--attention of the mind; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead;
satvatam--of the devotees; patih--protector; srotavyah--is to be heard; kirtitavyah--to be glorified; ca--and;
dhyeyah--to be remembered; pujyah--to be worshiped; ca--and; nityada--constantly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, with one-pointed attention, one should constantly hear about, glorify, remember and
worship the Personality of Godhead, who is the protector of the devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
If realization of the Absolute Truth is the ultimate aim of life, it must be carried out by all means. In any
one of the above-mentioned castes and orders of life, the four processes, namely glorifying, hearing,
remembering and worshiping, are general occupations. Without these principles of life, no one can exist.
Activities of the living being involve engagements in these four different principles of life. Especially in
modern society, all activities are more or less dependent on hearing and glorifying. Any man from any
social status becomes a well-known man in human society within a very short time if he is simply
glorified truly or falsely in the daily newspapers. Sometimes political leaders of a particular party are also
advertised by newspaper propaganda, and by such a method of glorification an insignificant man becomes
an important man--within no time. But such propaganda by false glorification of an unqualified person
cannot bring about any good, either for the particular man or for the society. There may be some
temporary reactions to such propaganda, but there are no permanent effects. Therefore such activities are
a waste of time. The actual object of glorification is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has created
everything manifested before us. We have broadly discussed this fact from the beginning of the "janmady
asya" sloka of this Bhagavatam. The tendency to glorify others or hear others must be turned to the real
object of glorification--the Supreme Being. And that will bring happiness.
