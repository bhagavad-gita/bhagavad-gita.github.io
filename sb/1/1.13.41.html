<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Narada said: O pious King, do not lament for anyone, for everyone is under the control of the
Supreme Lord. Therefore all living beings and their leaders carry on worship to be well protected. It is He
only who brings them together and disperses them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living being, either in this material world or in the spiritual world, is under the control of the
Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Beginning from Brahmaji, the leader of this universe, down to
the insignificant ant, all are abiding by the order of the Supreme Lord. Thus the constitutional position of
the living being is subordination under the control of the Lord. The foolish living being, especially man,
artificially rebels against the law of the Supreme and thus becomes chastised as an asura, or lawbreaker. A
living being is placed in a particular position by the order of the Supreme Lord, and he is again shifted
from that place by the order of the Supreme Lord or His authorized agents. Brahma, Siva, Indra, Candra,
Maharaja Yudhisthira or, in modern history, Napoleon, Akbar, Alexander, Gandhi, Shubhash and Nehru
all are servants of the Lord, and they are placed in and removed from their respective positions by the
supreme will of the Lord. None of them is independent. Even though such men or leaders rebel so as not
to recognize the supremacy of the Lord, they are put under still more rigorous laws of the material world
by different miseries. Only the foolish man, therefore, says that there is no God. Maharaja Yudhisthira was
being convinced of this naked truth because he was greatly overwhelmed by the sudden departure of his
old uncles and aunt. Maharaja Dhrtarastra was placed in that position according to his past deeds; he had
already suffered or enjoyed the benefits accrued to him in the past, but due to his good luck, somehow or
other he had a good younger brother, Vidura, and by his instruction he left to achieve salvation by closing
all accounts in the material world.
Ordinarily one cannot change the course of one's due happiness and distress by plan. Everyone has to
accept them as they come under the subtle arrangement of kala, or invincible time. There is no use trying
to counteract them. The best thing is, therefore, that one should endeavor to achieve salvation, and this
prerogative is given only to man because of his developed condition of mental activities and intelligence.
Only for man are there different Vedic instructions for attainment of salvation during the human form of
existence. One who misuses this opportunity of advanced intelligence is verily condemned and put into
different types of miseries, either in this present life or in the future. That is the way the Supreme controls
everyone.
