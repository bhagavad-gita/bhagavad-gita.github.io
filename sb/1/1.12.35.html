<h2>Text</h2>
ahuto bhagavan rajna
yajayitva dvijair nrpam
uvasa katicin masan
suhrdam priya-kamyaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ahutah--being called by; bhagavan--Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead; rajna--by the King;
yajayitva--causing to be performed; dvijaih--by the learned brahmanas; nrpam--on behalf of the King;
uvasa--resided; katicit--a few; masan--months; suhrdam--for the sake of the relatives; priya-kamyaya--for
the pleasure.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, being invited to the sacrifices by Maharaja Yudhisthira, saw
to it that they were performed by qualified [twice-born] brahmanas. After that, for the pleasure of the
relatives, the Lord remained a few months.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna was invited by Maharaja Yudhisthira to look into the supervision of the performances of
yajna, and the Lord, to abide by the orders of His elderly cousin, caused the performance of yajnas by
learned twice-born brahmanas. Simply taking birth in the family of a brahmana does not make one
qualified to perform yajnas. One must be twice-born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide
acarya. The once-born scions of brahmana families are equal with the once-born sudras, and such
brahma-bandhus, or unqualified once-born scions, must be rejected for any purpose of religious or Vedic
function. Lord Sri Krsna was entrusted to look after this arrangement, and perfect as He is, He caused the
yajnas to be performed by the bona fide twice-born brahmanas for successful execution.
