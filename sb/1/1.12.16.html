destruction; upeyusi--having been enforced; ratah--restored; vah--for you; anugraha-arthaya--for the sake

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The brahmanas said: This spotless son has been restored by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Lord
Visnu, the Personality of Godhead, in order to oblige you. He was saved when he was doomed to be
destroyed by an irresistible supernatural weapon.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The child Pariksit was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Visnu (Lord Krsna) for two reasons.
The first reason is that the child in the womb of his mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee
of the Lord. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puru, the pious
forefather of the virtuous King Yudhisthira. The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule
over the earth as His representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. After the
Battle of Kuruksetra, even up to the next generation of Maharaja Yudhisthira was annihilated, and there
were none who could generate another son in the great royal family. Maharaja Pariksit, the son of
Abhimanyu, was the only surviving heir apparent in the family, and by the irresistible supernatural
brahmastra weapon of Asvatthama, he was forced to be annihilated. Lord Krsna is described herein as
Visnu, and this is also significant. Lord Krsna, the original Personality of Godhead, does the work of
protection and annihilation in His capacity of Visnu. Lord Visnu is the plenary expansion of Lord Krsna.
The all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by Him in His Visnu feature. Child Pariksit is
described here as spotlessly white because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. Such unalloyed
devotees of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord. The Lord desires the
conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed to go back home, back to Godhead,
and thus He helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the Vedas, by sending
missionaries of saints and sages and by deputing His representative, the spiritual master. Such
transcendental literatures, missionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the
contamination of the material qualities cannot even touch them. They are always protected by the Lord
when they are threatened with annihilation. Such foolish threats are made by the gross materialists. The
brahmastra, which was thrown by Asvatthama at the child Pariksit, was certainly supernaturally powerful,
and nothing of the material world could resist its force of penetration. But the all-powerful Lord, who is
present everywhere, within and without, could counteract it by His all-powerful potency just to save a
bona fide servant of the Lord and descendant of another devotee, Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was always
obliged by the Lord by His causeless mercy.
