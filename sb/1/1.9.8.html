<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami (Brahmarata): The famous son and disciple of Sri Vyasadeva, who taught him first
the Mahabharata and then Srimad-Bhagavatam. Sukadeva Gosvami recited 1,400,000 verses of the
Mahabharata in the councils of the Gandharvas, Yaksas and Raksasas, and he recited Srimad-Bhagavatam
for the first time in the presence of Maharaja Pariksit. He thoroughly studied all the Vedic literatures from
his great father. Thus he was a completely purified soul by dint of his extensive knowledge in the
principles of religion. From Mahabharata, Sabha-parva (4.11) it is understood that he was also present in
the royal assembly of Maharaja Yudhisthira and at the fasting of Maharaja Pariksit. As a bona fide disciple
of Sri Vyasadeva, he inquired from his father very extensively about religious principles and spiritual
values, and his great father also satisfied him by teaching him the yoga system by which one can attain the
spiritual kingdom, the difference between fruitive work and empiric knowledge, the ways and means of
attaining spiritual realization, the four asramas (namely the student life, the householder's life, the retired
life and the renounced life), the sublime position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the process of
seeing Him eye to eye, the bona fide candidate for receiving knowledge, the consideration of the five
elements, the unique position of intelligence, the consciousness of the material nature and the living
entity, the symptoms of the self-realized soul, the working principles of the material body, the symptoms
of the influential modes of nature, the tree of perpetual desire, and psychic activities. Sometimes he went
to the sun planet with the permission of his father and Naradaji. Descriptions of his travel in space are
given in the Santi-parva of the Mahabharata (332). At last he attained the transcendental realm. He is
known by different names like Araneya, Arunisuta, Vaiyasaki and Vyasatmaja.
Kasyapa: One of the prajapatis, the son of Marici and one of the sons-in-law of Prajapati Daksa. He is the
father of the gigantic bird Garuda, who was given elephants and tortoises as eatables. He married thirteen
daughters of Prajapati Daksa, and their names are Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kastha, Arista, Surasa, Ila, Muni,
Krodhavasa, Tamra, Surabhi, Sarama and Timi. He begot many children, both demigods and demons, by
those wives. From his first wife, Aditi, all the twelve Adityas were born; one of them is Vamana, the
incarnation of Godhead. This great sage, Kasyapa, was also present at the time of Arjuna's birth. He
received a presentation of the whole world from Parasurama, and later on he asked Parasurama to go out
of the world. His other name is Aristanemi. He lives on the northern side of the universe.
Angirasa: He is the son of Maharsi Angira and is known as Brhaspati, the priest of the demigods. It is
said that Dronacarya was his partial incarnation. Sukracarya was the spiritual master of the demons, and
Brhaspati challenged him. His son is Kaca, and he delivered the fire weapon first to Bharadvaja Muni. He
begot six sons (like the fire-god) by his wife Candramasi, one of the reputed stars. He could travel in
space, and therefore he could present himself even in the planets of Brahmaloka and Indraloka. He
advised the King of heaven, Indra, about conquering the demons. Once he cursed Indra, who thus had to
become a hog on the earth and was unwilling to return to heaven. Such is the power of the attraction of
the illusory energy. Even a hog does not wish to part with its earthly possessions in exchange for a
heavenly kingdom. He was the religious preceptor of the natives of different planets.
