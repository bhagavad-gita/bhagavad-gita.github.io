pratikriya na yasyeha
kutascit karhicit prabho
sa esa bhagavan kalah
sarvesam nah samagatah
SYNONYMS
pratikriya--remedial measure; na--there is none; yasya--of which; iha--in this material world; kutascit--
by any means; karhicit--or by anyone; prabho--O my lord; sah--that; esah--positively; bhagavan--the
Personality of Godhead; kalah--eternal time; sarvesam--of all; nah--of us; samagatah--arrived.
TRANSLATION
This frightful situation cannot be remedied by any person in this material world. My lord, it is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as eternal time [kala] that has approached us all.
PURPORT
There is no superior power which can check the cruel hands of death. No one wants to die, however
acute the source of bodily sufferings may be. Even in the days of so-called scientific advancement of
knowledge, there is no remedial measure either for old age or for death. Old age is the notice of the arrival
of death served by cruel time, and no one can refuse to accept either summon calls or the supreme
judgment of eternal time. This is explained before Dhrtarastra because he might ask Vidura to find out
some remedial measure for the imminent fearful situation, as he had ordered many times before. Before
ordering, however, Vidura informed Dhrtarastra that there was no remedial measure by anyone or from
any source in this material world. And because there is no such thing in the material world, death is
identical with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as it is said by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita
(10.34).
Death cannot be checked by anyone or from any source within this material world. Hiranyakasipu
wanted to be immortal and underwent a severe type of penance by which the whole universe trembled,
and Brahma himself approached him to dissuade Hiranyakasipu from such a severe type of penance.
Hiranyakasipu asked Brahma to award him the blessings of immortality, but Brahma said that he himself
was subject to death, even in the topmost planet, so how could he award him the benediction of
immortality? So there is death even in the topmost planet of this universe, and what to speak of other
planets, which are far, far inferior in quality to Brahmaloka, the residing planet of Brahma. Wherever
there is the influence of eternal time, there is this set of tribulations, namely birth, disease, old age and
death, and all of them are invincible.
