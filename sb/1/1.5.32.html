<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Brahmana Vyasadeva, it is decided by the learned that the best remedial measure for removing all
troubles and miseries is to dedicate one's activities to the service of the Supreme Lord Personality of
Godhead [Sri Krsna].
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Narada Muni personally experienced that the most feasible and practical way to open the path of
salvation or get relief from all miseries of life is to hear submissively the transcendental activities of the
Lord from the right and bona fide sources. This is the only remedial process. The entire material existence
is full of miseries. Foolish people have manufactured, out of their tiny brains, many remedial measures for
removing the threefold miseries pertaining to the body and mind, pertaining to the natural disturbances
and in relation with other living beings. The whole world is struggling very hard to exist out of these
miseries, but men do not know that without the sanction of the Lord no plan or no remedial measure can
actually bring about the desired peace and tranquillity. The remedial measure to cure a patient by medical
treatment is useless if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. To cross the river or the ocean by a suitable boat is
no remedial measure if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. We should know for certain that the Lord is the
ultimate sanctioning officer, and we must therefore dedicate our attempts to the mercy of the Lord for
ultimate success or to get rid of the obstacles on the path of success. The Lord is all-pervading, allpowerful,
omniscient and omnipresent. He is the ultimate sanctioning agent of all good or bad effects. We
should, therefore, learn to dedicate our activities unto the mercy of the Lord and accept Him either as
impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It does not matter
what one is. One must dedicate everything in the service of the Lord. If one is a learned scholar, scientist,
philosopher, poet, etc., then he should employ his learning to establish the supremacy of the Lord. Try to
study the energy of the Lord in every sphere of life. Do not decry Him and try to become like Him or take
His position simply by fragmental accumulation of knowledge. If one is an administrator, statesman,
warrior, politician, etc., then one should try to establish the Lord's supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for
the cause of the Lord as Sri Arjuna did. In the beginning, Sri Arjuna, the great fighter, declined to fight,
but when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting was necessary, Sri Arjuna changed his decision
and fought for His cause. Similarly, if one is a businessman, an industrialist, an agriculturist, etc., then
one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord. Think always that the money which is
accumulated is the wealth of the Lord. Wealth is considered to be the goddess of fortune (Laksmi), and
the Lord is Narayana, or the husband of Laksmi. Try to engage Laksmi in the service of Lord Narayana
and be happy. That is the way to realize the Lord in every sphere of life. The best thing is, after all, to get
relief from all material activities and engage oneself completely in hearing the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord. But in case of the absence of such an opportunity, one should try to engage in the service of the
Lord everything for which one has specific attraction, and that is the way of peace and prosperity. The
word samsucitam in this stanza is also significant. One should not think for a moment that the realization
of Narada was childish imagination only. It is not like that. It is so realized by the expert and erudite
scholars, and that is the real import of the word samsucitam.
