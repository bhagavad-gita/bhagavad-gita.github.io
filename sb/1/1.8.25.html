<h2>Text</h2>
vipadah santu tah sasvat
tatra tatra jagad-guro
bhavato darsanam yat syad
apunar bhava-darsanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vipadah--calamities; santu--let there be; tah--all; sasvat--again and again; tatra--there; tatra--and there;
jagat-guro--O Lord of the universe; bhavatah--Your; darsanam--meeting; yat--that which; syat--is;
apunah--not again; bhava-darsanam--seeing repetition of birth and death.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again,
for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Generally the distressed, the needy, the intelligent and the inquisitive, who have performed some pious
activities, worship or begin to worship the Lord. Others, who are thriving on misdeeds only, regardless of
status, cannot approach the Supreme due to being misled by the illusory energy. Therefore, for a pious
person, if there is some calamity there is no other alternative than to take shelter of the lotus feet of the
Lord. Constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation from birth and
death. Therefore, even though there are so-called calamities, they are welcome because they give us an
opportunity to remember the Lord, which means liberation.
One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord, which are accepted as the most suitable boat for
crossing the ocean of nescience, can achieve liberation as easily as one leaps over the holes made by the
hoofs of a calf. Such persons are meant to reside in the abode of the Lord, and they have nothing to do
with a place where there is danger in every step.
This material world is certified by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gita as a dangerous place full of calamities.
Less intelligent persons prepare plans to adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this
place is itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the Lord, which is full of bliss
and without trace of calamity. The duty of the sane person, therefore, is to be undisturbed by worldly
calamities, which are sure to happen in all circumstances. Suffering all sorts of unavoidable misfortunes,
one should make progress in spiritual realization because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul
is transcendental to all material calamities; therefore, the so-called calamities are called false. A man may
see a tiger swallowing him in a dream, and he may cry for this calamity. Actually there is no tiger and
there is no suffering; it is simply a case of dreams. In the same way, all calamities of life are said to be
dreams. If someone is lucky enough to get in contact with the Lord by devotional service, it is all gain.
Contact with the Lord by any one of the nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path
going back to Godhead.
