jnanam guhyatamam yat tat
saksad bhagavatoditam
anvavocan gamisyantah
krpaya dina-vatsalah
SYNONYMS
jnanam--knowledge; guhyatamam--most confidential; yat--what is; tat--that; saksat--directly; bhagavata
uditam--propounded by the Lord Himself; anvavocan--gave instruction; gamisyantah--while departing
from; krpaya--by causeless mercy; dina-vatsalah--those who are very kind to the poor and meek.
TRANSLATION
As they were leaving, those bhakti-vedantas, who are very kind to poor-hearted souls, instructed me in
that most confidential subject which is instructed by the Personality of Godhead Himself.
PURPORT
A pure Vedantist, or a bhakti-vedanta, instructs followers exactly according to the instructions of the
Lord Himself. The Personality of Godhead, both in the Bhagavad-gita and in all other scriptures, has
definitely instructed men to follow the Lord only. The Lord is the creator, maintainer and annihilator of
everything. The whole manifested creation is existing by His will, and by His will when the whole show is
finished He will remain in His eternal abode with all His paraphernalia. Before the creation He was there
in the eternal abode, and after the annihilation He will continue to remain. He is not, therefore, one of the
created beings. He is transcendental. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that long, long before the
instruction was imparted to Arjuna, the same was instructed to the sun-god, and in course of time, the
same instruction, being wrongly handled and being broken, was again instructed to Arjuna because he
was His perfect devotee and friend. Therefore, the instruction of the Lord can be understood by the
devotees only and no one else. The impersonalist, who has no idea of the transcendental form of the Lord,
cannot understand this most confidential message of the Lord. The expression "most confidential" is
significant here because knowledge of devotional service is far, far above knowledge of impersonal
Brahman. Jnanam means ordinary knowledge or any branch of knowledge. This knowledge develops up
to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Above this, when it is partially mixed with devotion, such
knowledge develops to knowledge of Paramatma, or the all-pervading Godhead. This is more confidential.
But when such knowledge is turned into pure devotional service and the confidential part of
transcendental knowledge is attained, it is called the most confidential knowledge. This most confidential
knowledge was imparted by the Lord to Brahma, Arjuna, Uddhava, etc.
