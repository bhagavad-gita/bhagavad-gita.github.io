<h2>Text</h2>
hantasmin janmani bhavan
ma mam drastum iharhati
avipakva-kasayanam
durdarso 'ham kuyoginam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hanta--O Narada; asmin--this; janmani--duration of life; bhavan--yourself; ma--not; mam--Me;
drastum--to see; iha--here; arhati--deserve; avipakva--immature; kasayanam--material dirt; durdarsah--
difficult to be seen; aham--I; kuyoginam--incomplete in service.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Narada [the Lord spoke], I regret that during this lifetime you will not be able to see Me anymore.
Those who are incomplete in service and who are not completely free from all material taints can hardly
see Me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Personality of Godhead is described in the Bhagavad-gita as the most pure, the Supreme and the
Absolute Truth. There is no trace of a tinge of materiality in His person, and thus one who has the
slightest tinge of material affection cannot approach Him. The beginning of devotional service starts from
the point when one is freed from at least two forms of material modes, namely the mode of passion and
the mode of ignorance. The result is exhibited by the signs of being freed from kama (lust) and lobha
(covetousness). That is to say, one must be freed from the desires for sense satisfaction and avarice for
sense gratification. The balanced mode of nature is goodness. And to be completely freed from all material
tinges is to become free from the mode of goodness also. To search the audience of God in a lonely forest
is considered to be in the mode of goodness. One can go out into the forest to attain spiritual perfection,
but that does not mean that one can see the Lord personally there. One must be completely freed from all
material attachment and be situated on the plane of transcendence, which alone will help the devotee get
in personal touch with the Personality of Godhead. The best method is that one should live at a place
where the transcendental form of the Lord is worshiped. The temple of the Lord is a transcendental place,
whereas the forest is a materially good habitation. A neophyte devotee is always recommended to worship
the Deity of the Lord (arcana) rather than go into the forest to search out the Lord. Devotional service
begins from the process of arcana, which is better than going out in the forest. In his present life, which is
completely freed from all material hankerings, Sri Narada Muni does not go into the forest, although he
can turn every place into Vaikuntha by his presence only. He travels from one planet to another to
convert men, gods, Kinnaras, Gandharvas, rsis, munis and all others to become devotees of the Lord. By
his activities he has engaged many devotees like Prahlada Maharaja, Dhruva Maharaja and many others in
the transcendental service of the Lord. A pure devotee of the Lord, therefore, follows in the footsteps of
the great devotees like Narada and Prahlada and engages his whole time in glorifying the Lord by the
process of kirtana. Such a preaching process is transcendental to all material qualities.
