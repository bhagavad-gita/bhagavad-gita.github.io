<h2><a href="http://bhagavad-gita.today/sb/1/1.8.22.html">1.8.22</a></h2>

<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
namah pankaja-nabhaya
namah pankaja-maline
namah pankaja-netraya
namas te pankajanghraye
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
namah--all respectful obeisances; pankaja-nabhaya--unto the Lord who has a specific depression
resembling a lotus flower in the center of His abdomen; namah--obeisances; pankaja-maline--one who is
always decorated with a garland of lotus flowers; namah--obeisances; pankaja-netraya--one whose glance
is as cooling as a lotus flower; namah te--respectful obeisances unto You; pankaja-anghraye--unto You,
the soles of whose feet are engraved with lotus flowers (and who are therefore said to possess lotus feet).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My respectful obeisances are unto You, O Lord, whose abdomen is marked with a depression like a
lotus flower, who are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, whose glance is as cool as the lotus
and whose feet are engraved with lotuses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead
which distinguish His body from the bodies of all others. They are all special features of the body of the
Lord. The Lord may appear as one of us, but He is always distinct by His specific bodily features. Srimati
Kunti claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman. This is claimed because women,
sudras (the laborer class) and the dvija-bandhus, or the wretched descendants of the higher three classes,
are unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual name, fame,
attributes, forms, etc., of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such persons, although they are unfit to enter into
the spiritual affairs of the Lord, can see Him as the arca-vigraha, who descends on the material world just
to distribute favors to the fallen souls, including the above-mentioned women, sudras and dvija-bandhus.
Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matter, the Lord condescends to enter into each
and every one of the innumerable universes as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who grows a lotus stem from
the lotuslike depression in the center of His transcendental abdomen, and thus Brahma, the first living
being in the universe, is born. Therefore, the Lord is known as the Pankajanabhi. The Pankajanabhi Lord
accepts the arca-vigraha (His transcendental form) in different elements, namely a form within the mind,
a form made of wood, a form made of earth, a form made of metal, a form made of jewel, a form made of
paint, a form drawn on sand, etc. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus
flowers, and there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning
attention of the nondevotees always engaged in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form
within the mind. Therefore, the Lord is merciful even to the women, sudras and dvija-bandhus, provided
they agree to visit the temple of worship in different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not
idolaters, as alleged by some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great acaryas established such
temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligent, and one should not pose himself as
transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of the sudras and the
women or less. One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feet, gradually rising to the thighs, waist,
chest and face. One should not try to look at the face of the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the
lotus feet of the Lord. Srimati Kunti, because of her being the aunt of the Lord, did not begin to see the
Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamed, and thus Kuntidevi, just to save a painful
situation for the Lord, began to see the Lord just above His lotus feet, i.e., from the waist of the Lord,
gradually rising to the face, and then down to the lotus feet. In the round, everything there is in order.
