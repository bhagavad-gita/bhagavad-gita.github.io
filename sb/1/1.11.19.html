<h2>Translation</h2>
At the same time, many hundreds of well-known prostitutes began to proceed on various vehicles. They
were all very eager to meet the Lord, and their beautiful faces were decorated with dazzling earrings,
which enhanced the beauty of their foreheads.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We may not hate even the prostitutes if they are devotees of the Lord. Even to date there are many
prostitutes in great cities of India who are sincere devotees of the Lord. By tricks of chance one may be
obliged to adopt a profession which is not very adorable in society, but that does not hamper one in
executing devotional service to the Lord. Devotional service to the Lord is uncheckable in all
circumstances. It is understood herewith that even in those days, about five thousand years ago, there
were prostitutes in a city like Dvaraka, where Lord Krsna resided. This means that prostitutes are
necessary citizens for the proper upkeep of society. The government opens wine shops, but this does not
mean that the government encourages the drinking of wine. The idea is that there is a class of men who
will drink at any cost, and it has been experienced that prohibition in great cities encouraged illicit
smuggling of wine. Similarly, men who are not satisfied at home require such concessions, and if there is
no prostitute, then such low men will induce others into prostitution. It is better that prostitutes be
available in the marketplace so that the sanctity of society can be maintained. It is better to maintain a
class of prostitutes than to encourage prostitutes within society. The real reformation is to enlighten all
people to become devotees of the Lord, and that will check all kinds of deteriorating factors of life.
Sri Bilvamangala Thakura, a great acarya of the Visnusvami Vaisnava sect, in his householder life was
overly attached to a prostitute who happened to be a devotee of the Lord. One night when the Thakura
came to Cintamani's house in torrents of rain and thunder, Cintamani was astonished to see how the
Thakura could come on such a dreadful night after crossing a foaming river which was full of waves. She
said to Thakura Bilvamangala that his attraction for the flesh and bone of an insignificant woman like her
would be properly utilized if it could be diverted to the devotional service of the Lord to achieve attraction
for the transcendental beauty of the Lord. It was a momentous hour for the Thakura, and he took a turn
towards spiritual realization by the words of a prostitute. Later on the Thakura accepted the prostitute as
his spiritual master, and in several places of his literary works he has glorified the name of Cintamani,
who showed him the right path.
In the Bhagavad-gita (9.32) the Lord says, "O son of Prtha, even the low-born candalas and those who
are born in a family of unbelievers, and even the prostitutes, shall attain perfection of life if they take
shelter of unalloyed devotional service to Me, because in the path of devotional service there are no
impediments due to degraded birth and occupation. The path is open for everyone who agrees to follow
it."
It appears that the prostitutes of Dvaraka, who were so eager to meet the Lord, were all His unalloyed
devotees, and thus they were all on the path of salvation according to the above version of the Bhagavadgita.
Therefore, the only reformation that is necessary in society is to make an organized effort to turn the
citizens into devotees of the Lord, and thus all good qualities of the denizens of heaven will overtake them
in their own way. On the other hand, those who are nondevotees have no good qualifications whatsoever,
however they may be materially advanced. The difference is that the devotees of the Lord are on the path
of liberation, whereas the nondevotees are on the path of further entanglement in material bondage. The
criterion of advancement of civilization is whether the people are educated and advanced on the path of
salvation.
