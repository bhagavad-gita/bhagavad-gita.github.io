asruyantasisah satyas
tatra tatra dvijeritah
nanurupanurupas ca
nirgunasya gunatmanah
SYNONYMS
asruyanta--being heard; asisah--benediction; satyah--all truths; tatra--here; tatra--there; dvija-iritah--
sounded by learned brahmanas; na--not; anurupa--befitting; anurupah--fitting; ca--also; nirgunasya--of the
Absolute; guna-atmanah--playing the role of a human being.
TRANSLATION
It was being heard here and there that the benedictions being paid to Krsna were neither befitting nor
unbefitting because they were all for the Absolute, who was now playing the part of a human being.
PURPORT
At places there were sounds of Vedic benediction aiming at the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. The
benedictions were fitting in the sense that the Lord was playing the part of a human being, as if a cousin
of Maharaja Yudhisthira, but they were also unfitting because the Lord is absolute and has nothing to do
with any kind of material relativities. He is nirguna, or there are no material qualities in Him, but He is
full of transcendental qualities. In the transcendental world there is nothing contradictory, whereas in the
relative world everything has its opposite. In the relative world white is the opposite conception of black,
but in the transcendental world there is no distinction between white and black. Therefore the sounds of
benedictions uttered by the learned brahmanas here and there appear to be contradictory in relation with
the Absolute Person, but when they are applied to the Absolute Person they lose all contradiction and
become transcendental. One example may clear this idea. Lord Sri Krsna is sometimes described as a thief.
He is very famous amongst His pure devotees as the Makhana-cora. He used to steal butter from the
houses of neighbors at Vrndavana in His early age. Since then He is famous as a thief. But in spite of His
being famous as a thief, He is worshiped as a thief, whereas in the mundane world a thief is punished and
is never praised. Since He is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, everything is applicable to Him, and
still in spite of all contradictions He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
