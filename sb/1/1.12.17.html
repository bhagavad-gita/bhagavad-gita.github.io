<h2>Text</h2>
tasman namna visnu-rata
iti loke bhavisyati
na sandeho maha-bhaga
maha-bhagavato mahan
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

iti--thus; loke--in all the planets; bhavisyati--shall become well known; na--no; sandehah--doubts; mahabhaga--
most fortunate; maha-bhagavatah--the first-class devotee of the Lord; mahan--qualified by all good
qualities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For this reason this child will be well known in the world as one who is protected by the Personality of
Godhead. O most fortunate one, there is no doubt that this child will become a first-class devotee and will
be qualified with all good qualities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord gives protection to all living beings because He is their supreme leader. The Vedic hymns
confirm that the Lord is the Supreme Person amongst all personalities. The difference between the two
living beings is that the one, the Personality of Godhead, provides for all other living beings, and by
knowing Him one can achieve eternal peace (Katha Upanisad). Such protection is given by His different
potencies to different grades of living beings. But as far as His unalloyed devotees are concerned, He gives
the protection personally. Therefore, Maharaja Pariksit is protected from the very beginning of his
appearance in the womb of his mother. And because he is especially given protection by the Lord, the
indication must be concluded that the child would be a first-grade devotee of the Lord with all good
qualities. There are three grades of devotees, namely the maha-bhagavata, madhyam-adhikari and the
kanistha-adhikari. Those who go to the temples of the Lord and offer worshipful respect to the Deity
without sufficient knowledge in the theological science and therefore without any respect for the devotees
of the Lord are called materialistic devotees, or kanistha-adhikari, the third-grade devotees. Secondly, the
devotees who have developed a mentality of genuine service to the Lord and who thus make friendships
only with similar devotees, show favor to the neophytes and avoid the atheists are called the second-grade
devotees. But those who see everything in the Lord or everything of the Lord and also see in everything an
eternal relation of the Lord, so that there is nothing within their purview of sight except the Lord, are
called the maha-bhagavatas, or the first-grade devotees of the Lord. Such first-grade devotees of the Lord
are perfect in all respects. A devotee who may be in any of these categories is automatically qualified by all
good qualities, and thus a maha-bhagavata devotee like Maharaja Pariksit is certainly perfect in all
respects. And because Maharaja Pariksit took his birth in the family of Maharaja Yudhisthira, he is
addressed herein as the maha-bhagavata, or the greatest of the fortunates. The family in which a mahabhagavata
takes his birth is fortunate because due to the birth of a first-grade devotee the members of the
family, past, present and future up to one hundred generations, become liberated by the grace of the Lord,
out of respect for His beloved devotee. Therefore, the highest benefit is done to one's family simply by
becoming an unalloyed devotee of the Lord.
