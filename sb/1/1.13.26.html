<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
gata-svartham imam deham
virakto mukta-bandhanah
avijnata-gatir jahyat
sa vai dhira udahrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
gata-sva-artham--without being properly utilized; imam--this; deham--material body; viraktah--
indifferently; mukta--being freed; bandhanah--from all obligations; avijnata-gatih--unknown destination;
jahyat--one should give up this body; sah--such a person; vai--certainly; dhirah--undisturbed; udahrtah--is
said to be so.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He is called undisturbed who goes to an unknown, remote place and, freed from all obligations, quits
his material body when it has become useless.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narottama dasa Thakura, a great devotee and acarya of the Gaudiya Vaisnava sect, has sung: "My Lord, I
have simply wasted my life. Having obtained the human body, I have neglected to worship Your Lordship,
and therefore I have willingly drunk poison." In other words, the human body is especially meant for
cultivating knowledge of devotional service to the Lord, without which life becomes full of anxieties and
miserable conditions. Therefore, one who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to
leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives and, being thus freed from all obligations of
family, society, country, etc., give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know
where and how he has met his death. Dhira means one who is not disturbed, even when there is sufficient
provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relation with wife and
children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for family, and if anyone is at all able to
forget such a relation, he is called undisturbed, or dhira. This is, however, the path of renunciation based
on a frustrated life, but stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide
saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord.
Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of
service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord. Dhrtarastra was lucky
enough to have a brother whose very association was a source of liberation for his frustrated life.
