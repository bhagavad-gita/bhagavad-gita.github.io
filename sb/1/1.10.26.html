<h2>Translation</h2>
Oh, how supremely glorified is the dynasty of King Yadu, and how virtuous is the land of Mathura,
where the supreme leader of all living beings, the husband of the goddess of fortune, has taken His birth
and wandered in His childhood.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna has expressively given a description of His
transcendental appearance, disappearance and activities. The Lord appears in a particular family or place
by His inconceivable potency. He does not take His birth as a conditioned soul quits his body and accepts
another body. His birth is like the appearance and disappearance of the sun. The sun arises on the eastern
horizon, but that does not mean that the eastern horizon is the parent of the sun. The sun is existent in
every part of the solar system, but he becomes visible at a scheduled time and so also becomes invisible at
another scheduled time. Similarly, the Lord appears in this universe like the sun and again leaves our
sight at another time. He exists at all times and at every place, but by His causeless mercy when He
appears before us we take it for granted that He has taken His birth. Anyone who can understand this
truth, in terms of the statements of revealed scriptures, certainly becomes liberated just after quitting the
present body. Liberation is obtainable after many births and after great endeavor in patience and
perseverance, in knowledge and renunciation. But simply by knowing in truth about the Lord's
transcendental births and activities, one can get liberation at once. That is the verdict of the Bhagavadgita.
But those who are in the darkness of ignorance conclude that the Lord's birth and activities in the
material world are similar to those of the ordinary living being. Such imperfect conclusions cannot give
anyone liberation. His birth, therefore, in the family of King Yadu as the son of King Vasudeva and His
transfer into the family of Nanda Maharaja in the land of Mathura are all transcendental arrangements
made by the internal potency of the Lord. The fortunes of the Yadu dynasty and that of the inhabitants of
the land of Mathura cannot be materially estimated. If simply by knowing the transcendental nature of the
birth and activities of the Lord one can get liberation easily, we can just imagine what is in store for those
who actually enjoyed the company of the Lord in person as a family member or as a neighbor. All those
who were fortunate enough to associate with the Lord, the husband of the goddess of fortune, certainly
obtained something more than what is known as liberation. Therefore, rightly, the dynasty and the land
are both ever glorious by the grace of the Lord.
