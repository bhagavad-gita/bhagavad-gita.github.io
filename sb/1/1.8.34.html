<h2>Translation</h2>
Others say that the world, being overburdened like a boat at sea, is much aggrieved, and that Brahma,
who is Your son, prayed for You, and so You have appeared to diminish the trouble.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma, or the first living being born just after the creation, is the direct son of Narayana. Narayana, as
Garbhodakasayi Visnu, first of all entered the material universe. Without spiritual contact, matter cannot
create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered
the universe, and the first living being, Brahma, was born on a lotus flower grown out of the
transcendental abdomen of Visnu. Visnu is therefore known as Padmanabha. Brahma is known as atmabhu
because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Laksmiji. Laksmiji
was present near Narayana, engaged in the service of the Lord, and still, without contact with Laksmiji,
Narayana begot Brahma. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers Narayana like
other living beings should take a lesson from this. Narayana is not an ordinary living being. He is the
Personality of Godhead Himself, and He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His
transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourse, and he has no other
means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But Narayana, being omnipotent, is not
bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His
various potencies, very easily and perfectly. Brahma is therefore directly the son of the father and was not
put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as atma-bhu. This Brahma is in charge of further
creations in the universe, secondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the
universe there is a transcendental planet known as Svetadvipa, which is the abode of the Ksirodakasayi
Visnu, the Paramatma feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot
be solved by the administrative demigods, they approach Brahmaji for a solution, and if it is not to be
solved even by Brahmaji, then Brahmaji consults and prays to the Ksirodakasayi Visnu for an incarnation
and solution to the problems. Such a problem arose when Kamsa and others were ruling over the earth
and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras. Brahmaji, along with other
demigods, prayed at the shore of the Ksirodaka Ocean, and they were advised of the descent of Krsna as
the son of Vasudeva and Devaki. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of
Brahmaji.
