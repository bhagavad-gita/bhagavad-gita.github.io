<h2>Text</h2>
tatrasinam kuru-patim
dhrtarastram sahanujam

prtham krsnam ca madhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--there; asinam--sitting; kuru-patim--the King of the Kurus; dhrtarastram--Dhrtarastra; sahaanujam--
with his younger brothers; gandharim--Gandhari; putra--son; soka-artam--overtaken by
bereavement; prtham--Kunti; krsnam--Draupadi; ca--also; madhavah--Lord Sri Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There sat the King of the Kurus, Maharaja Yudhisthira, along with his younger brothers and Dhrtarastra,
Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi, all overwhelmed with grief. Lord Krsna was also there.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Battle of Kuruksetra was fought between family members, and thus all affected persons were also
family members like Maharaja Yudhisthira and brothers, Kunti, Draupadi, Subhadra, Dhrtarastra,
Gandhari and her daughters-in-law, etc. All the principal dead bodies were in some way or other related
with each other, and therefore the family grief was combined. Lord Krsna was also one of them as a
cousin of the Pandavas and nephew of Kunti, as well as brother of Subhadra, etc. The Lord, therefore, was
equally sympathetic toward all of them, and therefore he began to pacify them befittingly.
