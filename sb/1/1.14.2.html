<h2>Text</h2>
vyatitah katicin masas
tada nayat tato 'rjunah
dadarsa ghora-rupani
nimittani kurudvahah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vyatitah--after passing; katicit--a few; masah--months; tada--at that time; na ayat--did not return; tatah--
from there; arjunah--Arjuna; dadarsa--observed; ghora--fearful; rupani--appearances; nimittani--various

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A few months passed, and Arjuna did not return. Maharaja Yudhisthira then began to observe some
inauspicious omens, which were fearful in themselves.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead is ad infinitum, more powerful than the most
powerful sun of our experience. Millions and billions of suns are created by Him and annihilated by Him
within His one breathing period. In the material world the sun is considered to be the source of all
productivity and material energy, and only due to the sun can we have the necessities of life. Therefore,
during the personal presence of the Lord on the earth, all paraphernalia for our peace and prosperity,
especially religion and knowledge, were in full display because of the Lord's presence, just as there is a
full flood of light in the presence of the glowing sun. Maharaja Yudhisthira observed some discrepancies
in his kingdom, and therefore he became very anxious about Arjuna, who was long absent, and there was
also no news about Dvaraka's well-being. He suspected the disappearance of Lord Krsna, otherwise there
would have been no possibility of fearful omens.
