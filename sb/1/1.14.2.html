yavatah krtavan prasnan
ksatta kausaravagratah
jataika-bhaktir govinde
tebhyas copararama ha
SYNONYMS
yavatah--all that; krtavan--did he put; prasnan--questions; ksatta--a name of Vidura; kausarava--a name
of Maitreya; agratah--in the presence of; jata--having grown up; eka--one; bhaktih--transcendental loving
service; govinde--unto Lord Krsna; tebhyah--regarding further questions; ca--and; upararama--retired
from; ha--in the past.
TRANSLATION
After asking various questions and becoming established in the transcendental loving service of Lord
Krsna, Vidura retired from putting questions to Maitreya Muni.
PURPORT
Vidura retired from putting questions before Maitreya Muni when he was convinced by Maitreya Rsi
that the summum bonum of life is to be finally situated in the transcendental loving service of Lord Sri
Krsna, who is Govinda, or one who satisfies His devotees in all respects. The conditioned soul, the living
being in material existence, seeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialism, but that
cannot give him satisfaction. He then searches after the Supreme Truth by the empiric philosophic
speculative method and intellectual feats. But if he does not find the ultimate goal, he again goes down to
material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic works, which all fail to give
him satisfaction. So neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction
because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, and all the Vedic
literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-gita (15.15) confirms this
statement.
Like Vidura, an inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya
and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma (fruitive activities), jnana
(philosophical research for the Supreme Truth) and yoga (the linking process of spiritual realization).
One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a
show-bottle spiritual master, nor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if
he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord Sri Krsna.
Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreya, and he got the ultimate goal of
life: bhakti unto Govinda. Thus there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress.

TRANSLATION
When they saw Vidura return to the palace, all the inhabitants--Maharaja Yudhisthira, his younger
brothers, Dhrtarastra, Satyaki, Sanjaya, Krpacarya, Kunti, Gandhari, Draupadi, Subhadra, Uttara, Krpi,
many other wives of the Kauravas, and other ladies with children--all hurried to him in great delight. It so
appeared that they had regained their consciousness after a long period.
PURPORT
Gandhari: The ideal chaste lady in the history of the world. She was the daughter of Maharaja Subala,
the King of Gandhara (now Kandahar in Kabul), and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord Siva. Lord
Siva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gandhari satisfied Lord Siva, and by
his benediction to obtain one hundred sons, she was betrothed to Dhrtarastra, despite his being blind
forever. When Gandhari came to know that her would-be husband was a blind man, to follow her life
companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linens,
and she was married to Dhrtarastra under the guidance of her elder brother Sakuni. She was the most
beautiful girl of her time, and she was equally qualified by her womanly qualities, which endeared every
member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualities, she had the natural frailties of a woman,
and she was envious of Kunti when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnant,
but Kunti first gave birth to a male child. Thus Gandhari became angry and gave a blow to her own
abdomen. As a result, she gave birth to a lump of flesh only, but since she was a devotee of Vyasadeva, by
the instruction of Vyasadeva the lump was divided into one hundred parts, and each part gradually
developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was
fulfilled, and she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of
the Battle of Kuruksetra was going on, she was not in favor of fighting with the Pandavas; rather, she
blamed Dhrtarastra, her husband, for such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two
parts, for the sons of Pandu and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of
Kuruksetra, and she wanted to curse Bhimasena and Yudhisthira, but she was checked by Vyasadeva. Her
mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Duhsasana before Lord Krsna was very pitiful, and Lord
Krsna pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Karna, and she
described to Lord Krsna the lamentation of Karna's wife. She was pacified by Srila Vyasadeva when he
showed her dead sons, then promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the
jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Maharaja Yudhisthira
performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt.
Prtha: Daughter of Maharaja Surasena and sister of Vasudeva, Lord Krsna's father. Later she was adopted
by Maharaja Kuntibhoja, and hence she is known as Kunti. She is the incarnation of the success potency
of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of
King Kuntibhoja, and Kunti was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage
Durvasa, and being satisfied by her faithful service, Durvasa Muni gave her a mantra by which it was
possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitiveness, she at once called for
the sun-god, who desired couplement with her, but she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity
from virgin adulteration, and so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplement, she became
pregnant, and Karna was born by her. By the grace of the sun, she again turned into a virgin girl, but
being afraid of her parents, she quitted the newly born child, Karna. After that, when she actually selected
her own husband, she preferred Pandu to be her husband. Maharaja Pandu later wanted to retire from
family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kunti refused to allow her husband to adopt such life,
but at last Maharaja Pandu gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable
personalities. Kunti did not accept this proposal at first, but when vivid examples were set by Pandu she
agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durvasa Muni she called for Dharmaraja, and thus
Yudhisthira was born. She called for the demigod Vayu (air), and thus Bhima was born. She called for
Indra, the King of heaven, and thus Arjuna was born. The other two sons, namely Nakula and Sahadeva,
were begotten by Pandu himself in the womb of Madri. Later on, Maharaja Pandu died at an early age, for
which Kunti was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wives, namely Kunti and Madri, decided that
Kunti should live for the maintenance of the five minor children, the Pandavas, and Madri should accept
the sati rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great
sages like Satasrnga and others present on the occasion.
Later on, when the Pandavas were banished from the kingdom by the intrigues of Duryodhana, Kunti
followed her sons, and she equally faced all sorts of difficulties during those days. During the forest life
one demon girl, Hidimba, wanted Bhima as her husband. Bhima refused, but when the girl approached
Kunti and Yudhisthira, they ordered Bhima to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this
combination, Ghatotkaca was born, and he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In
their forest life they lived with a brahmana family that was in trouble because of one Bakasura demon, and
Kunti ordered Bhima to kill the Bakasura to protect the brahmana family against troubles created by the
demon. She advised Yudhisthira to start for the Pancaladesa. Draupadi was gained in this Pancaladesa by
Arjuna, but by order of Kunti all five of the Pandava brothers became equally the husbands of Pancali, or
Draupadi. She was married with five Pandavas in the presence of Vyasadeva. Kuntidevi never forgot her
first child, Karna, and after Karna's death in the Battle of Kuruksetra she lamented and admitted before
her other sons that Karna was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Maharaja Pandu. Her prayers for
the Lord after the Battle of Kuruksetra, when Lord Krsna was going back home, are excellently explained.
Later she went to the forest with Gandhari for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty
days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire.
Draupadi: The most chaste daughter of Maharaja Drupada and partly an incarnation of goddess Saci, the
wife of Indra. Maharaja Drupada performed a great sacrifice under the superintendence of the sage Yaja.
By his first offering, Dhrstadyumna was born, and by the second offering, Draupadi was born. She is
therefore the sister of Dhrstadyumna, and she is also named Pancali. The five Pandavas married her as a
common wife, and each of them begot a son in her. Maharaja Yudhisthira begot a son named Pratibhit,
Bhimasena begot a son named Sutasoma, Arjuna begot Srutakirti, Nakula begot Satanika, and Sahadeva
begot Srutakarma. She is described as a most beautiful lady, equal to her mother-in-law, Kunti. During her
birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Krsna. The same message also declared that she
was born to kill many a ksatriya. By dint of her blessings from Sankara, she was awarded five husbands,
equally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husband, princes and kings were invited from all
the countries of the world. She was married with the Pandavas during their exile in the forest, but when
they went back home Maharaja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by
all the daughters-in-law of Dhrtarastra. When she was lost in a gambling game, she was forcibly dragged
into the assembly hall, and an attempt was made by Duhsasana to see her naked beauty, even though
there were elderly persons like Bhisma and Drona present. She was a great devotee of Lord Krsna, and by
her praying, the Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the
name Jatasura kidnapped her, but her second husband, Bhimasena, killed the demon and saved her. She
saved the Pandavas from the curse of Maharsi Durvasa by the grace of Lord Krsna. When the Pandavas
lived incognito in the palace of Virata, Kicaka was attracted by her exquisite beauty, and by arrangement
with Bhima the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were
killed by Asvatthama. At the last stage, she accompanied her husband Yudhisthira and others and fell on
the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhisthira, but when Yudhisthira entered the
heavenly planet he saw Draupadi gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet.
Subhadra: Daughter of Vasudeva and sister of Lord Sri Krsna. She was not only a very dear daughter of
Vasudeva, but also a very dear sister to both Krsna and Baladeva. The two brothers and sister are
represented in the famous Jagannatha temple of Puri, and the temple is still visited by thousands of
pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kuruksetra during an occasion of solar
eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of Vrndavana. The meeting of Radha and Krsna
during this occasion is a very pathetic story, and Lord Sri Caitanya, in the ecstasy of Radharani, always
pined for Lord Sri Krsna at Jagannatha Puri. While Arjuna was at Dvaraka, he wanted to have Subhadra as
his queen, and he expressed his desire to Lord Krsna. Sri Krsna knew that His elder brother, Lord
Baladeva, was arranging her marriage elsewhere, and since He did not dare to go against the arrangement
of Baladeva, He advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadra. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the
Raivata Hill, Arjuna managed to kidnap Subhadra according to the plan of Sri Krsna. Sri Baladeva was very
angry at Arjuna, and He wanted to kill him, but Lord Krsna implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then
Subhadra was duly married with Arjuna, and Abhimanyu was born of Subhadra. At the premature death
of Abhimanyu, Subhadra was very mortified, but on the birth of Pariksit she was happy and solaced.
