<h2>Translation</h2>
Having been awarded a transcendental body befitting an associate of the Personality of Godhead, I quit
the body made of five material elements, and thus all acquired fruitive results of work [karma] stopped.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Informed by the Personality of Godhead that he would be awarded a transcendental body befitting the
Lord's association, Narada got his spiritual body as soon as he quitted his material body. This
transcendental body is free from material affinity and invested with three primary transcendental
qualities, namely eternity, freedom from material modes, and freedom from reactions of fruitive activities.
The material body is always afflicted with the lack of these three qualities. A devotee's body becomes at
once surcharged with the transcendental qualities as soon as he is engaged in the devotional service of the
Lord. It acts like the magnetic influence of a touchstone upon iron. The influence of transcendental
devotional service is like that. Therefore change of the body means stoppage of the reaction of three
qualitative modes of material nature upon the pure devotee. There are many instances of this in the
revealed scriptures. Dhruva Maharaja and Prahlada Maharaja and many other devotees were able to see
the Personality of Godhead face to face apparently in the same body. This means that the quality of a
devotee's body changes from material to transcendence. That is the opinion of the authorized Gosvamis
via the authentic scriptures. In the Brahma-samhita it is said that beginning from the indra-gopa germ up
to the great Indra, King of heaven, all living beings are subjected to the law of karma and are bound to
suffer and enjoy the fruitive results of their own work. Only the devotee is exempt from such reactions, by
the causeless mercy of the supreme authority, the Personality of Godhead.
