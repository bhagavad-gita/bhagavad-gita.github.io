<h2>Text</h2>

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit, who is also known as Visnurata [one who is always protected by Visnu], bowed his
head to receive the chief guest, Sukadeva Gosvami. At that time all the ignorant women and boys ceased
following Srila Sukadeva. Receiving respect from all, Sukadeva Gosvami took his exalted seat.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
On Sukadeva Gosvami's arrival at the meeting, everyone, except Srila Vyasadeva, Narada and a few
others, stood up, and Maharaja Pariksit, who was glad to receive a great devotee of the Lord, bowed down
before him with all the limbs of his body. Sukadeva Gosvami also exchanged the greetings and reception
by embrace, shaking of hands, nodding and bowing down, especially before his father and Narada Muni.
Thus he was offered the presidential seat at the meeting. When he was so received by the king and sages,
the street boys and less intelligent women who followed him were struck with wonder and fear. So they
retired from their frivolous activities, and everything was full of gravity and calm.
