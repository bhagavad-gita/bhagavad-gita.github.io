<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tada rajas-tamo-bhavah
kama-lobhadayas ca ye
ceta etair anaviddham
sthitam sattve prasidati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tada--at that time; rajah--in the mode of passion; tamah--the mode of ignorance; bhavah--the situation;
kama--lust and desire; lobha--hankering; adayah--others; ca--and; ye--whatever they are; cetah--the mind;
etaih--by these; anaviddham--without being affected; sthitam--being fixed; sattve--in the mode of
goodness; prasidati--thus becomes fully satisfied.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart, the effects of nature's modes of passion
and ignorance, such as lust, desire and hankering, disappear from the heart. Then the devotee is
established in goodness, and he becomes completely happy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A living being in his normal constitutional position is fully satisfied in spiritual bliss. This state of
existence is called brahma-bhuta or atma-nandi, or the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not
like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorance, whereas the
self-satisfied atmanandi is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is
attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivity, but
the unalloyed activity of the soul.
The soul's activity becomes adulterated in contact with matter, and as such the diseased activities are
expressed in the form of lust, desire, hankering, inactivity, foolishness and sleep. The effect of devotional
service becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and ignorance. The devotee
is fixed at once in the mode of goodness, and he makes further progress to rise to the position of
Vasudeva, or the state of unmixed sattva, or suddha-sattva. Only in this suddha-sattva state can one
always see Krsna eye to eye by dint of pure affection for the Lord.
A devotee is always in the mode of unalloyed goodness; therefore he harms no one. But the nondevotee,
however educated he may be, is always harmful. A devotee is neither foolish nor passionate. The harmful,
foolish and passionate cannot be devotees of the Lord, however they may advertise themselves as devotees
by outward dress. A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such
qualifications may be different, but qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same.
