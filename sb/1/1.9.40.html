<h2>Translation</h2>
Let my mind be fixed upon Lord Sri Krsna, whose motions and smiles of love attracted the damsels of
Vrajadhama [the gopis]. The damsels imitated the characteristic movements of the Lord [after His
disappearance from the rasa dance].
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By intense ecstasy in loving service, the damsels of Vrajabhumi attained qualitative oneness with the
Lord by dancing with Him on an equal level, embracing Him in nuptial love, smiling at Him in joke, and
looking at Him with a loving attitude. The relation of the Lord with Arjuna is undoubtedly praiseworthy
for devotees like Bhismadeva, but the relation of the gopis with the Lord is still more praiseworthy
because of their still more purified loving service. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna was fortunate enough
to have the fraternal service of the Lord as chariot driver, but the Lord did not award Arjuna with equal
strength. The gopis, however, practically became one with the Lord by attainment of equal footing with
the Lord. Bhisma's aspiration to remember the gopis is a prayer to have their mercy also at the last stage of
his life. The Lord is satisfied more when His pure devotees are glorified, and therefore Bhismadeva has not
only glorified the acts of Arjuna, his immediate object of attraction, but has also remembered the gopis,
who were endowed with unrivalled opportunities by rendering loving service to the Lord. The gopis'
equality with the Lord should never be misunderstood to be like the sayujya liberation of the
impersonalist. The equality is one of perfect ecstasy where the differential conception is completely
eradicated, for the interests of the lover and the beloved become identical.
