<h2>Translation</h2>
Please, therefore, describe the Almighty Lord's activities which you have learned by your vast
knowledge of the Vedas, for that will satisfy the hankerings of great learned men and at the same time
mitigate the miseries of the masses of common people who are always suffering from material pangs.
Indeed, there is no other way to get out of such miseries.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Narada Muni from practical experience definitely asserts that the prime solution of all problems of
material work is to broadcast very widely the transcendental glories of the Supreme Lord. There are four
classes of good men, and there are four classes of bad men also. The four classes of good men
acknowledge the authority of the Almighty God, and therefore such good men (1) when they are in
difficulty, (2) when they are in need of money, (3) when they are advanced in knowledge and (4) when
they are inquisitive to know more and more about God, intuitively take shelter of the Lord. As such,
Naradaji advises Vyasadeva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic
knowledge which he had already attained.
As far as the bad men are concerned, they are also four in number: (1) those who are simply addicted to
the mode of progressive fruitive work and thus are subjected to the accompanying miseries, (2) those who
are simply addicted to vicious work for sense satisfaction and so suffer the consequence, (3) those who
are materially very much advanced in knowledge, but who suffer because they do not have the sense to
acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Lord, and (4) the class of men who are known as atheists and
who therefore purposely hate the very name of God, although they are always in difficulty.
Sri Naradaji advised Vyasadeva to describe the glories of the Lord just to do good to all eight classes of
men, both good and bad. Srimad-Bhagavatam is therefore not meant for any particular class of men or
sect. It is for the sincere soul who actually wants his own welfare and peace of mind.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Narada's Instructions on Srimad-Bhagavatam for Vyasadeva."
