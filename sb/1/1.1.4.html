<h2>Translation</h2>
Once, in a holy place in the forest of Naimisaranya, great sages headed by the sage Saunaka assembled to
perform a great thousand-year sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord and His devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The prelude of the Srimad-Bhagavatam was spoken in the previous three slokas. Now the main topic of
this great literature is being presented. Srimad-Bhagavatam, after its first recitation by Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami, was repeated for the second time at Naimisaranya.
In the Vayaviya Tantra, it is said that Brahma, the engineer of this particular universe, contemplated a
great wheel which could enclose the universe. The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place
known as Naimisaranya. Similarly, there is another reference to the forest of Naimisaranya in the Varaha
Purana, where it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is
curtailed. Thus brahmanas prefer Naimisaranya for such sacrificial performances.
The devotees of Lord Visnu offer all kinds of sacrifices for His pleasure. The devotees are always
attached to the service of the Lord, whereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence.
In Bhagavad-gita, it is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the
pleasure of Lord Visnu causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must
be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Visnu and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace
and prosperity.
The great sages are always anxious to do good to the people in general, and as such the sages headed by
Saunaka and others assembled at this holy place of Naimisaranya with a program of performing a great
and continuous chain of sacrificial ceremonies. Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and
prosperity. However, the sages know it well, and therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious
to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entities,
and at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the
good of all people. Lord Visnu is just like a great tree, and all others, including the demigods, men,
Siddhas, Caranas, Vidyadharas and other living entities, are like branches, twigs and leaves of that tree. By
pouring water on the root of the tree, all the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those
branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up
gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarly, human society, when it is detached from the Personality
of Godhead like detached branches and leaves, is not capable of being watered, and one attempting to do
so is simply wasting his energy and resources.
The modern materialistic society is detached from its relation to the Supreme Lord. And all its plans
which are being made by atheistic leaders are sure to be baffled at every step. Yet they do not wake up to
this.
In this age, the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord is the prescribed method for
waking up. The ways and means are most scientifically presented by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and
intelligent persons may take advantage of His teachings in order to bring about real peace and prosperity.
Srimad-Bhagavatam is also presented for the same purpose, and this will be explained more specifically
later in the text.
