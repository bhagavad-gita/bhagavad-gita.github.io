<h2>Translation</h2>
As soon as I began to meditate upon the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead with my mind
transformed in transcendental love, tears rolled down my eyes, and without delay the Personality of
Godhead Sri Krsna appeared on the lotus of my heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word bhava is significant here. This bhava stage is attained after one has transcendental affection for
the Lord. The first initial stage is called sraddha, or a liking for the Supreme Lord, and in order to increase
that liking one has to associate with pure devotees of the Lord. The third stage is to practice the
prescribed rules and regulations of devotional service. This will dissipate all sorts of misgivings and
remove all personal deficiencies that hamper progress in devotional service.
When all misgivings and personal deficiencies are removed, there is a standard faith in transcendental
matter, and the taste for it increases in greater proportion. This stage leads to attraction, and after this
there is bhava, or the prior stage of unalloyed love for God. All the above different stages are but different
stages of development of transcendental love. Being so surcharged with transcendental love, there comes a
strong feeling of separation which leads to eight different kinds of ecstasies. Tears from the eyes of a
devotee is an automatic reaction, and because Sri Narada Muni in his previous birth attained that stage
very quickly after his departure from home, it was quite possible for him to perceive the actual presence
of the Lord, which he tangibly experienced by his developed spiritual senses without material tinge.
