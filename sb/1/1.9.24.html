<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He; deva-devah--the Supreme Lord of the lords; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead;
pratiksatam--may kindly wait; kalevaram--body; yavat--as long as; idam--this (material body); hinomi--
may quit; aham--I; prasanna--cheerful; hasa--smiling; aruna-locana--eyes red like the morning sun;
ullasat--beautifully decorated; mukha-ambujah--the lotus flower of His face; dhyana-pathah--in the path
of my meditation; catur-bhujah--the four-handed form of Narayana (the worshipable Deity of
Bhismadeva).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
May my Lord, who is four-handed and whose beautifully decorated lotus face, with eyes as red as the
rising sun, is smiling, kindly await me at that moment when I quit this material body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhismadeva knew well that Lord Krsna is the original Narayana. His worshipable Deity was four-handed
Narayana, but he knew that four-handed Narayana is a plenary expansion of Lord Krsna. Indirectly he
desired Lord Sri Krsna to manifest Himself in His four-handed feature of Narayana. A Vaisnava is always
humble in his behavior. Although it was cent percent certain that Bhismadeva was approaching
Vaikuntha-dhama just after leaving his material body, still as a humble Vaisnava he desired to see the
beautiful face of the Lord, for after quitting the present body he might not be in a position to see the Lord
any more. A Vaisnava is not puffed up, although the Lord guarantees His pure devotee entrance into His
abode. Here Bhismadeva says, "as long as I do not quit this body." This means that the great General
would quit the body by his own will; he was not being forced by the laws of nature. He was so powerful
that he could stay in his body as long as he desired. He got this benediction from his father. He desired
that the Lord stay before him in His four-handed Narayana feature so that he might concentrate upon Him
and thus be in trance in that meditation. Then his mind might be sanctified with thinking of the Lord.
Thus he did not mind wherever he might go. A pure devotee is never very anxious to go back to the
kingdom of God. He entirely depends on the good will of the Lord. He is equally satisfied even if the Lord
desires him to go to hell. The only desire that a pure devotee entertains is that he may always be in rapt
attention with thinking of the lotus feet of the Lord, regardless. Bhismadeva wanted this much only: that
his mind be absorbed in thinking of the Lord and that he pass away thus. That is the highest ambition of a
pure devotee.
