<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
sa go-dohana-matram hi
grhesu grha-medhinam
aveksate maha-bhagas
tirthi-kurvams tad asramam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Sukadeva Gosvami); go-dohana-matram--only for the time of milking the cow; hi--certainly;
grhesu--in the house; grha-medhinam--of the householders; aveksate--waits; maha-bhagah--the most
fortunate; tirthi--pilgrimage; kurvan--transforming; tat asramam--the residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He [Sukadeva Gosvami] was accustomed to stay at the door of a householder only long enough for a
cow to be milked. And he did this just to sanctify the residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami met Emperor Pariksit and explained the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam. He was not
accustomed to stay at any householder's residence for more than half an hour (at the time of milking the
cow), and he would just take alms from the fortunate householder. That was to sanctify the residence by
his auspicious presence. Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami is an ideal preacher established in the
transcendental position. From his activities, those who are in the renounced order of life and dedicated to
the mission of preaching the message of Godhead should learn that they have no business with
householders save and except to enlighten them in transcendental knowledge. Such asking for alms from
the householder should be for the purpose of sanctifying his home. One who is in the renounced order of
life should not be allured by the glamor of the householder's worldly possessions and thus become
subservient to worldly men. For one who is in the renounced order of life, this is much more dangerous
than drinking poison and committing suicide.
