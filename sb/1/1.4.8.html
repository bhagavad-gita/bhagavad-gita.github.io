trtiyam rsi-sargam vai
devarsitvam upetya sah
tantram satvatam acasta
naiskarmyam karmanam yatah
SYNONYMS
trtiyam--the third one; rsi-sargam--the millennium of the rsis; vai--certainly; devarsitvam--incarnation of
the rsi amongst the demigods; upetya--having accepted; sah--he; tantram--exposition of the Vedas;
satvatam--which is especially meant for devotional service; acasta--collected; naiskarmyam--nonfruitive;
karmanam--of work; yatah--from which.
TRANSLATION
In the millennium of the rsis, the Personality of Godhead accepted the third empowered incarnation in
the form of Devarsi Narada, who is a great sage among the demigods. He collected expositions of the
Vedas which deal with devotional service and which inspire nonfruitive action.
PURPORT
The great Rsi Narada, who is an empowered incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, propagates
devotional service all over the universe. All great devotees of the Lord all over the universe and in
different planets and species of life are his disciples. Srila Vyasadeva, the compiler of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, is also one of his disciples. Narada is the author of Narada-pancaratra, which is the
exposition of the Vedas particularly for the devotional service of the Lord. This Narada-pancaratra trains
the karmis, or the fruitive workers, to achieve liberation from the bondage of fruitive work. The
conditioned souls are mostly attracted by fruitive work because they want to enjoy life by the sweat of
their own brows. The whole universe is full of fruitive workers in all species of life. The fruitive works
include all kinds of economic development plans. But the law of nature provides that every action has its
resultant reaction, and the performer of the work is bound up by such reactions, good or bad. The
reaction of good work is comparative material prosperity, whereas the reaction of bad work is
comparative material distress. But material conditions, either in so-called happiness or in so-called
distress, are all meant ultimately for distress only. Foolish materialists have no information of how to
obtain eternal happiness in the unconditional state. Sri Narada informs these foolish fruitive workers how
to realize the reality of happiness. He gives direction to the diseased men of the world how one's present
engagement can lead one to the path of spiritual emancipation. The physician directs the patient to take
treated milk in the form of curd for his sufferings from indigestion due to his taking another milk
preparation. So the cause of the disease and the remedy of the disease may be the same, but it must be
treated by an expert physician like Narada. The Bhagavad-gita also gives the same solution of serving the
Lord by the fruits of one's labor. That will lead one to the path of naiskarmya, or liberation.
