<h2>Translation</h2>
O Suta Gosvami, please describe those topics of the Lord by which Maharaja Pariksit, whose intelligence
was fixed on liberation, attained the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of Garuda, the king of birds.
Those topics were vibrated by the son of Vyasa [Srila Sukadeva].
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is some controversy amongst the students on the path of liberation. Such transcendental students
are known as impersonalists and devotees of the Lord. The devotee of the Lord worships the
transcendental form of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist meditates upon the glaring effulgence, or the
bodily rays of the Lord, known as the brahmajyoti. Here in this verse it is said that Maharaja Pariksit
attained the lotus feet of the Lord by instructions in knowledge delivered by the son of Vyasadeva, Srila
Sukadeva Gosvami. Sukadeva Gosvami was also an impersonalist in the beginning, as he himself has
admitted in the Bhagavatam (2.1.9), but later on he was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord and thus became a devotee. Such devotees with perfect knowledge are called maha-bhagavatas, or
first-class devotees. There are three classes of devotees, namely the prakrta, madhyama, and mahabhagavata.
The prakrta, or third-class devotees, are temple worshipers without specific knowledge of the
Lord and the Lord's devotees. The madhyama, or the second-class devotee, knows well the Lord, the
Lord's devotees, the neophytes, and the nondevotees also. But the maha-bhagavata, or the first-class
devotee, sees everything in relation with the Lord and the Lord present in everyone's relation. The mahabhagavata,
therefore, does not make any distinction, particularly between a devotee and nondevotee.
Maharaja Pariksit was such a maha-bhagavata devotee because he was initiated by a maha-bhagavata
devotee, Sukadeva Gosvami. He was equally kind, even to the personality of Kali, and what to speak of
others.
So there are many instances in the transcendental histories of the world of an impersonalist who has
later become a devotee. But a devotee has never become an impersonalist. This very fact proves that on
the transcendental steps, the step occupied by a devotee is higher than the step occupied by an
impersonalist. It is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita (12.5) that persons stuck on the impersonal step
undergo more sufferings than achievement of reality. Therefore knowledge imparted by Sukadeva
Gosvami unto Maharaja Pariksit helped him attain the service of the Lord. And this stage of perfection is
called apavarga, or the perfect stage of liberation. Simple knowledge of liberation is material knowledge.
Actual freedom from material bondage is called liberation, but attainment of the transcendental service of
the Lord is called the perfect stage of liberation. Such a stage is attained by knowledge and renunciation,
as we have already explained (Bhag. 1.2.12), and perfect knowledge, as delivered by Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami, results in the attainment of the transcendental service of the Lord.
