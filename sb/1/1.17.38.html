<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: Maharaja Pariksit, thus being petitioned by the personality of Kali, gave him
permission to reside in places where gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter were
performed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The basic principles of irreligiosity, such as pride, prostitution, intoxication and falsehood, counteract
the four principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The personality of
Kali was given permission to live in four places particularly mentioned by the King, namely the place of
gambling, the place of prostitution, the place of drinking and the place of animal slaughter.
Srila Jiva Gosvami directs that drinking against the principles of scriptures, such as the sautramaniyajna,
association with women outside marriage, and killing animals against the injunctions of scriptures
are irreligious. In the Vedas two different types of injunctions are there for the pravrttas, or those who are
engaged in material enjoyment, and for the nivrttas, or those who are liberated from material bondage.
The Vedic injunction for the pravrttas is to gradually regulate their activities towards the path of
liberation. Therefore, for those who are in the lowest stage of ignorance and who indulge in wine, women
and flesh, drinking by performing sautramani-yajna, association of women by marriage and flesh-eating
by sacrifices are sometimes recommended. Such recommendations in the Vedic literature are meant for a
particular class of men, and not for all. But because they are injunctions of the Vedas for particular types
of persons, such activities by the pravrttas are not considered adharma. One man's food may be poison for
others; similarly, what is recommended for those in the mode of ignorance may be poison for those in the
mode of goodness. Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhu, therefore, affirms that recommendations in the scriptures
for a certain class of men are never to be considered adharma, or irreligious. But such activities are
factually adharma, and they are never to be encouraged. The recommendations in the scriptures are not
meant for the encouragement of such adharma, but for regulating the necessary adharma gradually toward
the path of dharma.
Following in the footsteps of Maharaja Pariksit, it is the duty of all executive heads of states to see that
the principles of religion, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, are established in the
state, and that the principles of irreligion, namely pride, illicit female association or prostitution,
intoxication and falsity, are checked by all means. And to make the best use of a bad bargain, the
personality of Kali may be transferred to places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and slaughterhouses, if
there are any places like that. Those who are addicted to these irreligious habits may be regulated by the
injunctions of the scripture. In no circumstances should they be encouraged by any state. In other words,
the state should categorically stop all sorts of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity. The state which
wants to eradicate corruption by majority may introduce the principles of religion in the following
manner:
1. Two compulsory fasting days in a month, if not more (austerity). Even from the economic point of
view, such two fasting days in a month in the state will save tons of food, and the system will also act very
favorably on the general health of the citizens.
2. There must be compulsory marriage of young boys and girls attaining twenty-four years of age and
sixteen years of age respectively. There is no harm in coeducation in the schools and colleges, provided
the boys and girls are duly married, and in case there is any intimate connection between a male and
female student, they should be married properly without illicit relation. The divorce act is encouraging
prostitution, and this should be abolished.
3. The citizens of the state must give in charity up to fifty percent of their income for the purpose of
creating a spiritual atmosphere in the state or in human society, both individually and collectively. They
should preach the principles of Bhagavatam by (a) karma-yoga, or doing everything for the satisfaction of
the Lord, (b) regular hearing of the Srimad-Bhagavatam from authorized persons or realized souls, (c)
chanting of the glories of the Lord congregationally at home or at places of worship, (d) rendering all
kinds of service to bhagavatas engaged in preaching Srimad-Bhagavatam and (e) residing in a place where
the atmosphere is saturated with God consciousness. If the state is regulated by the above process,
naturally there will be God consciousness everywhere.
Gambling of all description, even speculative business enterprise, is considered to be degrading, and
when gambling is encouraged in the state, there is a complete disappearance of truthfulness. Allowing
young boys and girls to remain unmarried more than the above-mentioned ages and licensing animal
slaughterhouses of all description should be at once prohibited. The flesh-eaters may be allowed to take
flesh as mentioned in the scriptures, and not otherwise. Intoxication of all description--even smoking
cigarettes, chewing tobacco or the drinking of tea--must be prohibited.
