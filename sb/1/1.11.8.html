amantrya cabhyanujnatah
parisvajyabhivadya tam
aruroha ratham kaiscit
parisvakto 'bhivaditah
SYNONYMS
amantrya--taking permission; ca--and; abhyanujnatah--being permitted; parisvajya--embracing;
abhivadya--bowing down at the feet; tam--unto Maharaja Yudhisthira; aruroha--ascended; ratham--the
chariot; kaiscit--by someone; parisvaktah--being embraced; abhivaditah--being offered obeisances.
TRANSLATION
Afterwards, when the Lord asked permission to depart and the King gave it, the Lord offered His
respects to Maharaja Yudhisthira by bowing down at his feet, and the King embraced Him. After this the
Lord, being embraced by others and receiving their obeisances, got into His chariot.
PURPORT
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the elder cousin of Lord Krsna, and therefore while departing from him the
Lord bowed down at the King's feet. The King embraced Him as a younger brother, although the King
knew perfectly well that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord takes pleasure when
some of His devotees accept Him as less important in terms of love. No one is greater than or equal to the
Lord, but He takes pleasure in being treated as younger than His devotees. These are all transcendental
pastimes of the Lord. The impersonalist cannot enter into the supernatural roles played by the devotee of
the Lord. Thereafter Bhima and Arjuna embraced the Lord because they were of the same age, but Nakula
and Sahadeva bowed down before the Lord because they were younger than He.
TEXTS 9-10
subhadra draupadi kunti
virata-tanaya tatha
gandhari dhrtarastras ca
yuyutsur gautamo yamau
vrkodaras ca dhaumyas ca
striyo matsya-sutadayah
na sehire vimuhyanto
viraham sarnga-dhanvanah
SYNONYMS
subhadra--the sister of Krsna; draupadi--the wife of the Pandavas; kunti--the mother of the Pandavas;
virata-tanaya--the daughter of Virata (Uttara); tatha--also; gandhari--the mother of Duryodhana;
dhrtarastrah--the father of Duryodhana; ca--and; yuyutsuh--the son of Dhrtarastra by his vaisya wife;
gautamah--Krpacarya; yamau--the twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva; vrkodarah--Bhima; ca--and;
dhaumyah--Dhaumya; ca--and; striyah--also other ladies of the palace; matsya-suta-adayah--the daughter
of a fisherman (Satyavati, Bhisma's stepmother); na--could not; sehire--tolerate; vimuhyantah--almost
fainting; viraham--separation; sarnga-dhanvanah--of Sri Krsna, who bears a conch in His hand.
TRANSLATION
At that time Subhadra, Draupadi, Kunti, Uttara, Gandhari, Dhrtarastra, Yuyutsu, Krpacarya, Nakula,
Sahadeva, Bhimasena, Dhaumya and Satyavati all nearly fainted because it was impossible for them to bear
separation from Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna is so attractive for the living beings, especially for the devotees, that it is impossible for
them to tolerate separation. The conditioned soul under the spell of illusory energy forgets the Lord,
otherwise he cannot. The feeling of such separation cannot be described, but it can simply be imagined by
devotees only. After His separation from Vrndavana and the innocent rural cowherd boys, girls, ladies and
others, they all felt shock throughout their lives, and the separation of Radharani, the most beloved
cowherd girl, is beyond expression. Once they met at Kuruksetra during a solar eclipse, and the feeling
which was expressed by them is heartrending. There is, of course, a difference in the qualities of the
transcendental devotees of the Lord, but none of them who have ever contacted the Lord by direct
communion or otherwise can leave Him for a moment. That is the attitude of the pure devotee.
TEXTS 11-12
sat-sangan mukta-duhsango
hatum notsahate budhah
kirtyamanam yaso yasya
sakrd akarnya rocanam
tasmin nyasta-dhiyah parthah
saheran viraham katham
darsana-sparsa-samlapasayanasana-
bhojanaih
SYNONYMS
sat-sangat--by the association of pure devotees; mukta-duhsangah--freed from bad materialistic
association; hatum--to give up; na utsahate--never attempts; budhah--one who has understood the Lord;
kirtyamanam--glorifying; yasah--fame; yasya--whose; sakrt--once only; akarnya--hearing only; rocanam--
pleasing; tasmin--unto Him; nyasta-dhiyah--one who has given his mind unto Him; parthah--the sons of
Prtha; saheran--can tolerate; viraham--separation; katham--how; darsana--seeing face to face; sparsa--
touching; samlapa--conversing; sayana--sleeping; asana--sitting; bhojanaih--dining together.
TRANSLATION
The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have
become freed from bad materialistic association, can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord, even
though they have heard them only once. How, then, could the Pandavas tolerate His separation, for they
had been intimately associated with His person, seeing Him face to face, touching Him, conversing with
Him, and sleeping, sitting and dining with Him?
PURPORT
The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the
dictates of illusory material energy in different phases of sense gratification. And in serving the senses he
is never tired. Even though he may be tired, the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without
being satisfied. There is no end to such sense gratificatory business, and the conditioned soul becomes
entangled in such servitude without hope of release. The release is only effected by association with pure
devotees. By such association one is gradually promoted to his transcendental consciousness. Thus he can
know that his eternal position is to render service unto the Lord and not to the perverted senses in the
capacity of lust, anger, desire to lord it over, etc. Material society, friendship and love are all different
phases of lust. Home, country, family, society, wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes of bondage
in the material world, where the threefold miseries of life are concomitant factors. By associating with
pure devotees and by hearing them submissively, attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened,
and attraction for hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord becomes prominent. Once they
are, they will go on progressively without stoppage, like fire in gunpowder. It is said that Hari, the
Personality of Godhead, is so transcendentally attractive that even those who are self-satisfied by selfrealization
and are factually liberated from all material bondage also become devotees of the Lord. Under
the circumstances it is easily understood what must have been the position of the Pandavas, who were
constant companions of the Lord. They could not even think of separation from Sri Krsna, since the
attraction was more intense for them because of continuous personal contact. His remembrance by His
form, quality, name, fame, pastimes, etc., is also attractive for the pure devotee, so much so that he forgets
all forms, quality, name, fame and activities of the mundane world, and due to his mature association with
pure devotees he is not out of contact with the Lord for a moment.
