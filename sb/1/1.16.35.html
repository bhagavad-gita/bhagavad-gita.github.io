ka--who; va--either; saheta--can tolerate; viraham--separation; purusa-uttamasya--of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; prema--loving; avaloka--glancing; rucira-smita--pleasing smile; valgu-jalpaih--
hearty appeals; sthairyam--gravity; sa-manam--along with passionate wrath; aharat--conquered; madhu--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Who, therefore, can tolerate the pangs of separation from that Supreme Personality of Godhead? He
could conquer the gravity and passionate wrath of His sweethearts like Satyabhama by His sweet smile of
love, pleasing glance and hearty appeals. When He traversed my [earth's] surface, I would be immersed in
the dust of His lotus feet and thus would be sumptuously covered with grass which appeared like hairs
standing on me out of pleasure.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There were chances of separation between the Lord and His thousands of queens because of the Lord's
being absent from home, but as far as His connection with earth was concerned, the Lord would traverse
the earth with His lotus feet, and therefore there was no chance of separation. When the Lord left the
surface of the earth to return to His spiritual abode, the earth's feelings of separation were therefore more
acute.
