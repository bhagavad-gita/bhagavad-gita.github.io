<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the King, the worthy descendant of the Pandavas, decided once and for all and sat on the Ganges'
bank to fast until death and give himself up to the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, who alone is able to award
liberation. So, freeing himself from all kinds of associations and attachments, he accepted the vows of a
sage.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The water of the Ganges sanctifies all the three worlds, including the gods and the demigods, because it
emanates from the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead Visnu. Lord Krsna is the fountainhead of the
principle of visnu-tattva, and therefore shelter of His lotus feet can deliver one from all sins, including an
offense committed by a king unto a brahmana. Maharaja Pariksit, therefore, decided to meditate upon the
lotus feet of Lord Sri Krsna, who is Mukunda, or the giver of liberations of all description. The banks of
the Ganges or the Yamuna give one a chance to remember the Lord continuously. Maharaja Pariksit freed
himself from all sorts of material association and meditated upon the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and that is
the way of liberation. To be free from all material association means to cease completely from committing
any further sins. To meditate upon the lotus feet of the Lord means to become free from the effects of all
previous sins. The conditions of the material world are so made that one has to commit sins willingly or
unwillingly, and the best example is Maharaja Pariksit himself, who was a recognized sinless, pious king.
But he also became a victim of an offense, even though he was ever unwilling to commit such a mistake.
He was cursed also, but because he was a great devotee of the Lord, even such reverses of life became
favorable. The principle is that one should not willingly commit any sin in his life and should constantly
remember the lotus feet of the Lord without deviation. Only in such a mood will the Lord help the
devotee make regular progress toward the path of liberation and thus attain the lotus feet of the Lord.
Even if there are accidental sins committed by the devotee, the Lord saves the surrendered soul from all
sins, as confirmed in all scriptures.
sva-pada-mulam bhajatah priyasya
tyaktany abhavasya harih paresah
vikarma yac cotpatitam kathancid
dhunoti sarvam hrdi sannivistah
(Bhag. 11.5.42)
