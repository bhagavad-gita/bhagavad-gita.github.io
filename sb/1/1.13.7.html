<h2>Text</h2>
tam bhuktavantam visrantam
asinam sukham asane
prasrayavanato raja
praha tesam ca srnvatam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--him (Vidura); bhuktavantam--after feeding him sumptuously; visrantam--and having taken rest;
asinam--being seated; sukham asane--on a comfortable seat; prasraya-avanatah--naturally very gentle and
meek; raja--King Yudhisthira; praha--began to speak; tesam ca--and by them; srnvatam--being heard.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After Vidura ate sumptuously and took sufficient rest, he was comfortably seated. Then the King began
to speak to him, and all who were present there listened.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
King Yudhisthira was expert in reception also, even in the case of his family members. Vidura was well
received by all the family members by exchange of embraces and obeisances. After that, bathing and
arrangements for a sumptuous dinner were made, and then he was given sufficient rest. After finishing his
rest, he was offered a comfortable place to sit, and then the King began to talk about all happenings, both
family and otherwise. That is the proper way to receive a beloved friend, or even an enemy. According to
Indian moral codes, even an enemy received at home should be so well received that he will not feel any
fearful situation. An enemy is always afraid of his enemy, but this should not be so when he is received at
home by his enemy. This means that a person, when received at home, should be treated as a relative, so
what to speak of a family member like Vidura, who was a well-wisher for all the members of the family.
Thus Yudhisthira Maharaja began to speak in the presence of all the other members.
