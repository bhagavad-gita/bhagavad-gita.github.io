<h2>Text</h2>
taya vilasitesv esu
gunesu gunavan iva
antah-pravista abhati
vijnanena vijrmbhitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
taya--by them; vilasitesu--although in the function; esu--these; gunesu--the modes of material nature;
gunavan--affected by the modes; iva--as if; antah--within; pravistah--entered into; abhati--appears to be;
vijnanena--by transcendental consciousness; vijrmbhitah--fully enlightened.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After creating the material substance, the Lord [Vasudeva] expands Himself and enters into it. And
although He is within the material modes of nature and appears to be; one of the created beings, He is
always fully enlightened in His transcendental position.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entities are separated parts and parcels of the Lord, and the conditioned living entities, who
are unfit for the spiritual kingdom, are strewn within the material world to enjoy matter to the fullest
extent. As Paramatma and eternal friend of the living entities, the Lord, by one of His plenary portions,
accompanies the living entities to guide them in their material enjoyment and to become witness to all
activities. While the living entities enjoy the material conditions, the Lord maintains His transcendental
position without being affected by the material atmosphere. In the Vedic literatures (sruti) it is said that
there are two birds in one tree.
* One of them is eating the fruit of the tree, while the other is witnessing the actions. The witness is the
Lord, and the fruit-eater is the living entity. The fruit-eater (living entity) has forgotten his real identity
and is overwhelmed in the fruitive activities of the material conditions, but the Lord (Paramatma) is
always full in transcendental knowledge. That is the difference between the Supersoul and the
conditioned soul. The conditioned soul, the living entity, is controlled by the laws of nature, while the
Paramatma, or the Supersoul, is the controller of the material energy.
