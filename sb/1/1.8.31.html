<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Krsna, Yasoda took up a rope to bind You when You committed an offense, and Your perturbed
eyes overflooded with tears, which washed the mascara from Your eyes. And You were afraid, though fear
personified is afraid of You. This sight is bewildering to me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is another explanation of the bewilderment created by the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. The
Supreme Lord is the Supreme in all circumstances, as already explained. Here is a specific example of the
Lord's being the Supreme and at the same time a plaything in the presence of His pure devotee. The Lord's
pure devotee renders service unto the Lord out of unalloyed love only, and while discharging such
devotional service the pure devotee forgets the position of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord also
accepts the loving service of His devotees more relishably when the service is rendered spontaneously out
of pure affection, without anything of reverential admiration. Generally the Lord is worshiped by the
devotees in a reverential attitude, but the Lord is meticulously pleased when the devotee, out of pure
affection and love, considers the Lord to be less important than himself. The Lord's pastimes in the
original abode of Goloka Vrndavana are exchanged in that spirit. The friends of Krsna consider Him one
of them. They do not consider Him to be of reverential importance. The parents of the Lord (who are all
pure devotees) consider Him a child only. The Lord accepts the chastisements of the parents more
cheerfully than the prayers of the Vedic hymns. Similarly, He accepts the reproaches of His fiancees more
palatably than the Vedic hymns. When Lord Krsna was present in this material world to manifest His
eternal pastimes of the transcendental realm of Goloka Vrndavana as an attraction for the people in
general, He displayed a unique picture of subordination before His foster mother, Yasoda. The Lord, in
His naturally childish playful activities, used to spoil the stocked butter of mother Yasoda by breaking the
pots and distributing the contents to His friends and playmates, including the celebrated monkeys of
Vrndavana, who took advantage of the Lord's munificence. Mother Yasoda saw this, and out of her pure
love she wanted to make a show of punishment for her transcendental child. She took a rope and
threatened the Lord that she would tie Him up, as is generally done in the ordinary household. Seeing the
rope in the hands of mother Yasoda, the Lord bowed down His head and began to weep just like a child,
and tears rolled down His cheeks, washing off the black ointment smeared about His beautiful eyes. This
picture of the Lord is adored by Kuntidevi because she is conscious of the Lord's supreme position. He is
feared often by fear personified, yet He is afraid of His mother, who wanted to punish Him just in an
ordinary manner. Kunti was conscious of the exalted position of Krsna, whereas Yasoda was not.
Therefore Yasoda's position was more exalted than Kunti's. Mother Yasoda got the Lord as her child, and
the Lord made her forget altogether that her child was the Lord Himself. If mother Yasoda had been
conscious of the exalted position of the Lord, she would certainly have hesitated to punish the Lord. But
she was made to forget this situation because the Lord wanted to make a complete gesture of childishness
before the affectionate Yasoda. This exchange of love between the mother and the son was performed in a
natural way, and Kunti, remembering the scene, was bewildered, and she could do nothing but praise the
transcendental filial love. Indirectly mother Yasoda is praised for her unique position of love, for she
could control even the all-powerful Lord as her beloved child.
