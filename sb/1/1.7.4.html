<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus he fixed his mind, perfectly engaging it by linking it in devotional service [bhakti-yoga] without
any tinge of materialism, and thus he saw the Absolute Personality of Godhead along with His external
energy, which was under full control.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Perfect vision of the Absolute Truth is possible only by the linking process of devotional service. This is
also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita. One can perfectly realize the Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead
only by the process of devotional service, and one can enter into the kingdom of God by such perfect
knowledge. Imperfect realization of the Absolute by the partial approach of the impersonal Brahman or
localized Paramatma does not permit anyone to enter into the kingdom of God. Sri Narada advised Srila
Vyasadeva to become absorbed in transcendental meditation on the Personality of Godhead and His
activities. Srila Vyasadeva did not take notice of the effulgence of Brahman because that is not absolute
vision. The absolute vision is the Personality of Godhead, as it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.19):
vasudevah sarvam iti. In the Upanisads also it is confirmed that Vasudeva, the Personality of Godhead, is
covered by the golden glowing hiranmayena patrena veil of impersonal Brahman, and when that curtain is
removed by the mercy of the Lord the real face of the Absolute is seen. The Absolute is mentioned here as
the purusa, or person. The Absolute Personality of Godhead is mentioned in so many Vedic literatures,
and in the Bhagavad-gita, the purusa is confirmed as the eternal and original person. The Absolute
Personality of Godhead is the perfect person. The Supreme Person has manifold energies, out of which
the internal, external and marginal energies are specifically important. The energy mentioned here is the
external energy, as will be clear from the statements of her activities. The internal energy is there along
with the Absolute Person as the moonlight is there with the moon. The external energy is compared to
darkness because it keeps the living entities in the darkness of ignorance. The word apasrayam suggests
that this energy of the Lord is under full control. The internal potency or superior energy is also called
maya, but it is spiritual maya, or energy exhibited in the absolute realm. When one is under the shelter of
this internal potency, the darkness of material ignorance is at once dissipated. And even those who are
atmarama, or fixed in trance, take shelter of this maya, or internal energy. Devotional service, or bhaktiyoga,
is the function of the internal energy; thus there is no place for the inferior energy, or material
energy, just as there is no place for darkness in the effulgence of spiritual light. Such internal energy is
even superior to the spiritual bliss attainable in the conception of impersonal Brahman. It is stated in the
Bhagavad-gita that the impersonal Brahman effulgence is also an emanation from the Absolute Personality
of Godhead Sri Krsna. The parama-purusa cannot be anyone except Sri Krsna Himself, as will be
explained in the later slokas.
