<h2>Translation</h2>
After that, Maharaja Yudhisthira dressed himself in torn clothing, gave up eating all solid foods,
voluntarily became dumb and let his hair hang loose. All this combined to make him look like an urchin
or madman with no occupation. He did not depend on his brothers for anything. And, just like a deaf
man, he heard nothing.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Thus being freed from all external affairs, he had nothing to do with imperial life or family prestige, and
for all practical purposes he posed himself exactly like an inert mad urchin and did not speak of material
affairs. He had no dependence on his brothers, who had all along been helping him. This stage of
complete independence from everything is also called the purified stage of fearlessness.
