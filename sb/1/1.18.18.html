<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Suta Gosvami said: O God, although we are born in a mixed caste, we are still promoted in birthright
simply by serving and following the great who are advanced in knowledge. Even by conversing with such
great souls, one can without delay cleanse oneself of all disqualifications resulting from lower births.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Suta Gosvami did not take his birth in a brahmana family. He was born in a family of mixed caste, or an
uncultured low family. But because of higher association, like Sri Sukadeva Gosvami and the great rsis of
Naimisaranya, certainly the disqualification of inferior birth was washed off. Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu followed this principle in pursuance of the Vedic usages, and by His transcendental
association He elevated many lowborn, or those disqualified by birth or action, to the status of devotional
service and established them in the position of acaryas, or authorities. He clearly stated that any man,
whatever he may be, whether a brahmana or sudra by birth, or a householder or mendicant in the order of
society, if he is conversant with the science of Krsna, he can be accepted as an acarya or guru, a spiritual
master.
Suta Gosvami learned the science of Krsna from great rsis and authorities like Sukadeva and Vyasadeva
and he was so qualified that even the sages of Naimisaranya eagerly wanted to hear from him the science
of Krsna in the form of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So he had the double association of great souls by hearing
and preaching. Transcendental science, or the science of Krsna, has to be learned from the authorities,
and when one preaches the science, he becomes still more qualified. So Suta Gosvami had both the
advantages, and thus undoubtedly he was completely freed from all disqualifications of low birth and
mental agonies. This verse definitely proves that Srila Sukadeva Gosvami did not refuse to teach Suta
Gosvami about the transcendental science nor did the sages of Naimisaranya refuse to hear lessons from
him because of his inferior birth. This means that thousands of years ago there was no bar to learning or
preaching the transcendental science because of inferior birth. The rigidity of the so-called caste system in
Hindu society became prominent within only one hundred years or so when the number of dvijabandhus,
or disqualified men in the families of higher castes, increased. Lord Sri Caitanya revived the
original Vedic system, and He elevated Thakura Haridasa to the position of namacarya, or the authority in
preaching the glories of the holy name of the Lord, although His Holiness Srila Haridasa Thakura was
pleased to appear in a family of Mohammedans.
Such is the power of pure devotees of the Lord. The Ganges water is accepted as pure, and one can
become purified after taking a bath in the waters of the Ganges. But as far as the great devotees of the Lord
are concerned, they can purify a degraded soul even by being seen by the lowborn, and what to speak of
association. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted to purify the whole atmosphere of the polluted world
by sending qualified preachers all over the world, and it remains with the Indians to take up this task
scientifically and thus do the best kind of humanitarian work. The mental diseases of the present
generation are more acute than bodily diseases; it is quite fit and proper to take up the preaching of
Srimad-Bhagavatam all over the world without delay. Mahattamanam abhidhana also means dictionary of
great devotees, or a book full of the words of great devotees. Such a dictionary of the words of great
devotees and those of the Lord are in the Vedas and allied literatures, specifically the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
