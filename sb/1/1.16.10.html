<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: While Maharaja Pariksit was residing in the capital of the Kuru empire, the
symptoms of the age of Kali began to infiltrate within the jurisdiction of his state. When he learned about
this, he did not think the matter very palatable. This did, however, give him a chance to fight. He took up
his bow and arrows and prepared himself for military activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The state administration of Maharaja Pariksit was so perfect that he was sitting in his capital peacefully.
But he got the news that the symptoms of the age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his
state, and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the age of Kali? They are (1) illicit
connection with women, (2) indulgence in meat-eating, (3) intoxication and (4) taking pleasure in
gambling. The age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel, and the abovementioned four symptoms in
human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. Maharaja Pariksit heard that some of the people
of the state had already taken to those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such
causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of Maharaja Pariksit, such symptoms of public
life were practically unknown, and as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out.
The news was not palatable for him, but in a way it was, because Maharaja Pariksit got a chance to fight.
There was no need to fight with small states because everyone was peacefully under his subordination,
but the Kali-yuga miscreants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect ksatriya king is
always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a sportsman is eager when there is a chance for
a sporting match. It is no argument that in the age of Kali such symptoms are predestined. If so, then why
was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such arguments are offered by lazy and
unfortunate men. In the rainy season, rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect
themselves. Similarly, in the age of Kali the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to infiltrate into social
life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens from the association of the agents of the age of Kali.
Maharaja Pariksit wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali, and thus save the
innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of religion. It is the duty of the king to give such
protection, and Maharaja Pariksit was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight.
