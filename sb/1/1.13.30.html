TRANSLATION
So his son would become famous in the world as Pariksit [examiner] because he would come to
examine all human beings in his search after that personality whom he saw before his birth. Thus he
would come to constantly contemplate Him.
PURPORT
Maharaja Pariksit, fortunate as he was, got the impression of the Lord even in the womb of his mother,
and thus his contemplation on the Lord was constantly with him. Once the impression of the
transcendental form of the Lord is fixed in one's mind, one can never forget Him in any circumstance.
Child Pariksit, after coming out of the womb, was in the habit of examining everyone to see whether he
was the same personality whom he first saw in the womb. But no one could be equal to or more attractive
than the Lord, and therefore he never accepted anyone. But the Lord was constantly with him by such
examination, and thus Maharaja Pariksit was always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord by
remembrance.
Srila Jiva Gosvami remarks in this connection that every child, if given an impression of the Lord from
his very childhood, certainly becomes a great devotee of the Lord like Maharaja Pariksit. One may not be
as fortunate as Maharaja Pariksit to have the opportunity to see the Lord in the womb of his mother, but
even if he is not so fortunate, he can be made so if the parents of the child desire him to be so. There is a
practical example in my personal life in this connection. My father was a pure devotee of the Lord, and
when I was only four or five years old, my father gave me a couple of forms of Radha and Krsna. In a
playful manner, I used to worship these Deities along with my sister, and I used to imitate the
performances of a neighboring temple of Radha-Govinda. By constantly visiting this neighboring temple
and copying the ceremonies in connection with my own Deities of play, I developed a natural affinity for
the Lord. My father used to observe all the ceremonies befitting my position. Later on, these activities
were suspended due to my association in the schools and colleges, and I became completely out of
practice. But in my youthful days, when I met my spiritual master, Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
Gosvami Maharaja, again I revived my old habit, and the same playful Deities became my worshipful
Deities in proper regulation. This was followed up until I left the family connection, and I am pleased that
my generous father gave the first impression which was developed later into regulative devotional service
by His Divine Grace. Maharaja Prahlada also advised that such impressions of a godly relation must be
impregnated from the beginning of childhood, otherwise one may miss the opportunity of the human
form of life, which is very valuable although it is temporary like others.
