TRANSLATION
Maharaja Yudhisthira was intelligent enough to understand the influence of the age of Kali,
characterized by increasing avarice, falsehood, cheating and violence throughout the capital, state, home
and among individuals. So he wisely prepared himself to leave home, and he dressed accordingly.
PURPORT
The present age is influenced by the specific qualities of Kali. Since the days of the Battle of Kuruksetra,
about five thousand years ago, the influence of the age of Kali began manifesting, and from authentic
scriptures it is learned that the age of Kali is still to run on for 427,000 years. The symptoms of the Kaliyuga,
as mentioned above, namely avarice, falsehood, diplomacy, cheating, nepotism, violence and all
such things, are already in vogue, and no one can imagine what is going to happen gradually with further
increase of the influence of Kali till the day of annihilation. We have already come to know that the
influence of the age of Kali is meant for godless so-called civilized man; those who are under the
protection of the Lord have nothing to fear from this horrible age. Maharaja Yudhisthira was a great
devotee of the Lord, and there was no necessity of his being afraid of the age of Kali, but he preferred to
retire from active household life and prepare himself to go back home, back to Godhead. The Pandavas
are eternal companions of the Lord, and therefore they are more interested in the company of the Lord
than anything else. Besides that, being an ideal king, Maharaja Yudhisthira wanted to retire just to set an
example for others. As soon as there is some young fellow to look after the household affairs, one should
at once retire from family life to uplift oneself to spiritual realization. One should not rot in the dark well
of household life till one is dragged out by the will of Yamaraja. Modern politicians should take lessons
from Maharaja Yudhisthira about voluntary retirement from active life and should make room for the
younger generation. Also retired old gentlemen should take lessons from him and leave home for spiritual
realization before forcefully dragged away to meet death.
