<h2>Translation</h2>
It was by His influence only that in a fight I was able to astonish the personality of god Lord Siva and his
wife, the daughter of Mount Himalaya. Thus he [Lord Siva] became pleased with me and awarded me his
own weapon. Other demigods also delivered their respective weapons to me, and in addition I was able to
reach the heavenly planets in this present body and was allowed a half-elevated seat.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, all the demigods, including Lord Siva,
were pleased with Arjuna. The idea is that one who is favored by Lord Siva or any other demigod may not
necessarily be favored by the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. Ravana was certainly a great devotee of Lord Siva,
but he could not be saved from the wrath of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra. And
there are many instances like that in the histories of the Puranas. But here is an instance where we can see
that Lord Siva became pleased even in the fight with Arjuna. The devotees of the Supreme Lord know
how to respect the demigods, but the devotees of the demigods sometimes foolishly think that the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is no greater than the demigods. By such a conception, one becomes an
offender and ultimately meets with the same end as Ravana and others. The instances described by Arjuna
during his friendly dealings with Lord Sri Krsna are instructive for all who may be convinced by the
lessons that one can achieve all favors simply by pleasing the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, whereas the
devotees or worshipers of the demigods may achieve only partial benefits, which are also perishable, just
as the demigods themselves are.
Another significance of the present verse is that Arjuna, by the grace of Lord Sri Krsna, was able to reach
the heavenly planet even with the selfsame body and was honored by the heavenly demigod Indradeva,
being seated with him half-elevated. One can reach the heavenly planets by the pious acts recommended
in the sastras in the category of fruitive activities. And as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (9.21), when the
reactions of such pious acts are spent, the enjoyer is again degraded to this earthly planet. The moon is
also on the level with the heavenly planets, and only persons who have performed virtues only--
performing sacrifices, giving charity and undergoing severe austerities--can be allowed to enter into the
heavenly planets after the duration of life of the body. Arjuna was allowed to enter into the heavenly
planets in the selfsame body simply by the grace of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible to do so. The
present attempts to enter into the heavenly planets by the modern scientists will certainly prove futile
because such scientists are not on the level of Arjuna. They are ordinary human beings, without any assets
of sacrifice, charity or austerities. The material body is influenced by the three modes of material nature,
namely goodness, passion and ignorance. The present population is more or less influenced by the modes
of passion and ignorance, and the symptoms for such influence are exhibited in their becoming very lusty
and greedy. Such degraded fellows can hardly approach the higher planetary systems. Above the heavenly
planets there are many other planets also, which only those who are influenced by goodness can reach. In
heavenly and other planets within the universe, the inhabitants are all highly intelligent, many more times
than the human beings, and they are all pious in the higher and highest mode of goodness. They are all
devotees of the Lord, and although their goodness is not unadulterated, still they are known as demigods
possessing the maximum amount of good qualities possible within the material world.
