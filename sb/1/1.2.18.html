<h2>Translation</h2>
By regular attendance in classes on the Bhagavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee, all
that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of
Godhead, who is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is the remedy for eliminating all inauspicious things within the heart which are considered to be
obstacles in the path of self-realization. The remedy is the association of the Bhagavatas. There are two
types of Bhagavatas, namely the book Bhagavata and the devotee Bhagavata. Both the Bhagavatas are
competent remedies, and both of them or either of them can be good enough to eliminate the obstacles. A
devotee Bhagavata is as good as the book Bhagavata because the devotee Bhagavata leads his life in terms
of the book Bhagavata and the book Bhagavata is full of information about the Personality of Godhead and
His pure devotees, who are also Bhagavatas. Bhagavata book and person are identical.
The devotee Bhagavata is a direct representative of Bhagavan, the Personality of Godhead. So by pleasing
the devotee Bhagavata one can receive the benefit of the book Bhagavata. Human reason fails to
understand how by serving the devotee Bhagavata or the book Bhagavata one gets gradual promotion on
the path of devotion. But actually these are facts explained by Srila Naradadeva, who happened to be a
maidservant's son in his previous life. The maidservant was engaged in the menial service of the sages,
and thus he also came into contact with them. And simply by associating with them and accepting the
remnants of foodstuff left by the sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great
devotee and personality Srila Naradadeva. These are the miraculous effects of the association of
Bhagavatas. And to understand these effects practically, it should be noted that by such sincere association
of the Bhagavatas one is sure to receive transcendental knowledge very easily, with the result that he
becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. The more progress is made in devotional service
under the guidance of the Bhagavatas, the more one becomes fixed in the transcendental loving service of
the Lord. The messages of the book Bhagavata, therefore, have to be received from the devotee Bhagavata,
and the combination of these two Bhagavatas will help the neophyte devotee to make progress on and on.
