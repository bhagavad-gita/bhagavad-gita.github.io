<h2>Text</h2>
yayaharad bhuvo bharam
tam tanum vijahav ajah
kantakam kantakeneva
dvayam capisituh samam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yaya--that by which; aharat--took away; bhuvah--of the world; bharam--burden; tam--that; tanum--
body; vijahau--relinquished; ajah--the unborn; kantakam--thorn; kantakena--by the thorn; iva--like that;
dvayam--both; ca--also; api--although; isituh--controlling; samam--equal.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The supreme unborn, Lord Sri Krsna, caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their
bodies, and thus He relieved the burden of the world. This action was like picking out a thorn with a
thorn, though both are the same to the controller.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura suggests that the rsis like Saunaka and others who were hearing
Srimad-Bhagavatam from Suta Gosvami at Naimisaranya were not happy to hear about the Yadu's dying in
the madness of intoxication. To give them relief from this mental agony, Suta Gosvami assured them that
the Lord caused the members of the Yadu dynasty to relinquish their bodies by which they had to take
away the burden of the world. The Lord and His eternal associates appeared on earth to help the
administrative demigods in eradicating the burden of the world. He therefore called for some of the
confidential demigods to appear in the Yadu family and serve Him in His great mission. After the mission
was fulfilled, the demigods, by the will of the Lord, relinquished their corporeal bodies by fighting
amongst themselves in the madness of intoxication. The demigods are accustomed to drinking the somarasa
beverage, and therefore the drinking of wine and intoxication are not unknown to them. Sometimes
they were put into trouble for indulging in intoxication. Once the sons of Kuvera fell in the wrath of
Narada for being intoxicated, but afterwards they regained their original forms by the grace of the Lord Sri
Krsna. We shall find this story in the Tenth Canto. For the Supreme Lord, both the asuras and the
demigods are equal, but the demigods are obedient to the Lord, whereas the asuras are not. Therefore, the
example of picking out a thorn by another thorn is quite befitting. One thorn, which causes pinpricks on
the leg of the Lord, is certainly disturbing to the Lord, and the other thorn, which takes out the disturbing
elements, certainly gives service to the Lord. So although every living being is a part and parcel of the
Lord, still one who is a pinprick to the Lord is called an asura, and one who is a voluntary servitor of the
Lord is called a devata, or demigod. In the material world the devatas and asuras are always contending,
and the devatas are always saved from the hands of the asuras by the Lord. Both of them are under the
control of the Lord. The world is full of two kinds of living beings, and the Lord's mission is always to
protect the devatas and destroy the asuras, whenever there is such a need in the world, and to do good to
both of them.
