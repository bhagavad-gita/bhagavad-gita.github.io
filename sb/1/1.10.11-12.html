<h2>Translation</h2>
The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have
become freed from bad materialistic association, can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord, even
though they have heard them only once. How, then, could the Pandavas tolerate His separation, for they
had been intimately associated with His person, seeing Him face to face, touching Him, conversing with
Him, and sleeping, sitting and dining with Him?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living being's constitutional position is one of serving a superior. He is obliged to serve by force the
dictates of illusory material energy in different phases of sense gratification. And in serving the senses he
is never tired. Even though he may be tired, the illusory energy perpetually forces him to do so without
being satisfied. There is no end to such sense gratificatory business, and the conditioned soul becomes
entangled in such servitude without hope of release. The release is only effected by association with pure
devotees. By such association one is gradually promoted to his transcendental consciousness. Thus he can
know that his eternal position is to render service unto the Lord and not to the perverted senses in the
capacity of lust, anger, desire to lord it over, etc. Material society, friendship and love are all different
phases of lust. Home, country, family, society, wealth and all sorts of corollaries are all causes of bondage
in the material world, where the threefold miseries of life are concomitant factors. By associating with
pure devotees and by hearing them submissively, attachment for material enjoyment becomes slackened,
and attraction for hearing about the transcendental activities of the Lord becomes prominent. Once they
are, they will go on progressively without stoppage, like fire in gunpowder. It is said that Hari, the
Personality of Godhead, is so transcendentally attractive that even those who are self-satisfied by selfrealization
and are factually liberated from all material bondage also become devotees of the Lord. Under
the circumstances it is easily understood what must have been the position of the Pandavas, who were
constant companions of the Lord. They could not even think of separation from Sri Krsna, since the
attraction was more intense for them because of continuous personal contact. His remembrance by His
form, quality, name, fame, pastimes, etc., is also attractive for the pure devotee, so much so that he forgets
all forms, quality, name, fame and activities of the mundane world, and due to his mature association with
pure devotees he is not out of contact with the Lord for a moment.
