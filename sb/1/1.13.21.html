<h2>Text</h2>
pitr-bhratr-suhrt-putra
hatas te vigatam vayam
atma ca jaraya grastah
para-geham upasase
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pitr--father; bhratr--brother; suhrt--well-wishers; putrah--sons; hatah--all dead; te--yours; vigatam--
expended; vayam--age; atma--the body; ca--also; jaraya--by invalidity; grastah--overcome; para-geham--
another's home; upasase--you do live.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Your father, brother, well-wishers and sons are all dead and passed away. You yourself have expended
the major portion of your life, your body is now overtaken by invalidity, and you are living in the home of
another.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The King is reminded of his precarious condition, influenced by cruel time, and by his past experience
he should have been more intelligent to see what was going to happen to his own life. His father,
Vicitravirya, died long ago, when he and his younger brothers were all little children, and it was due to
the care and kindness of Bhismadeva that they were properly brought up. Then again his brother Pandu
died also. Then in the Battlefield of Kuruksetra his one hundred sons and his grandsons all died, along
with all other well-wishers like Bhismadeva, Dronacarya, Karna and many other kings and friends. So he
had lost all men and money, and now he was living at the mercy of his nephew, whom he had put into
troubles of various types. And despite all these reverses, he thought that he would prolong his life more
and more. Vidura wanted to point out to Dhrtarastra that everyone has to protect himself by his action
and the grace of the Lord. One has to execute his duty faithfully, depending for the result on the supreme
authority. No friend, no children, no father, no brother, no state and no one else can protect a person who
is not protected by the Supreme Lord. One should, therefore, seek the protection of the Supreme Lord, for
the human form of life is meant for seeking that protection. He was warned of his precarious conditions
more and more by the following words.
