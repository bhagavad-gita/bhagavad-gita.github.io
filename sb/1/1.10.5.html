<h2>Translation</h2>
The rivers, oceans, hills, mountains, forests, creepers and active drugs, in every season, paid their tax
quota to the King in profusion.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since Maharaja Yudhisthira was under the protection of the ajita, the infallible Lord, as above
mentioned, the properties of the Lord, namely the rivers, oceans, hills, forests, etc., were all pleased, and
they used to supply their respective quota of taxes to the King. The secret to success is to take refuge
under the protection of the Supreme Lord. Without His sanction, nothing can be possible. To make
economic development by our own endeavors on the strength of tools and machinery is not all. The
sanction of the Supreme Lord must be there, otherwise despite all instrumental arrangements everything
will be unsuccessful. The ultimate cause of success is the daiva, the Supreme. Kings like Maharaja
Yudhisthira knew perfectly well that the king is the agent of the Supreme Lord to look after the welfare of
the mass of people. Actually the state belongs to the Supreme Lord. The rivers, oceans, forests, hills,
drugs, etc., are not creations of man. They are all creations of the Supreme Lord, and the living being is
allowed to make use of the property of the Lord for the service of the Lord. Today's slogan is that
everything is for the people, and therefore the government is for the people and by the people. But to
produce a new species of humanity at the present moment on the basis of God consciousness and
perfection of human life, the ideology of godly communism, the world has to again follow in the footsteps
of kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira or Pariksit. There is enough of everything by the will of the Lord, and
we can make proper use of things to live comfortably without enmity between men, or animal and man or
nature. The control of the Lord is everywhere, and if the Lord is pleased, every part of nature will be
pleased. The river will flow profusely to fertilize the land; the oceans will supply sufficient quantities of
minerals, pearls and jewels; the forest will supply sufficient wood, drugs and vegetables, and the seasonal
changes will effectively help produce fruits and flowers in profuse quantity. The artificial way of living
depending on factories and tools can render so-called happiness only to a limited number at the cost of
millions. Since the energy of the mass of people is engaged in factory production, the natural products are
being hampered, and for this the mass is unhappy. Without being educated properly, the mass of people
are following in the footsteps of the vested interests by exploiting natural reserves, and therefore there is
acute competition between individual and individual and nation and nation. There is no control by the
trained agent of the Lord. We must look into the defects of modern civilization by comparison here, and
should follow in the footsteps of Maharaja Yudhisthira to cleanse man and wipe out anachronisms.
