dharany uvaca
bhavan hi veda tat sarvam
yan mam dharmanuprcchasi
caturbhir vartase yena
padair loka-sukhavahaih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharani uvaca--mother earth replied; bhavan--your good self; hi--certainly; veda--know; tat sarvam--all
that you have inquired from me; yat--that; mam--from me; dharma--O personality of religious principles;
anuprcchasi--you have inquired one after another; caturbhih--by four; vartase--you exist; yena--by which;
padaih--by the legs; loka--in each and every planet; sukha-avahaih--increasing the happiness.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The earthly deity [in the form of a cow] thus replied to the personality of religious principles [in the
form of a bull]: O Dharma, whatever you have inquired from me shall be known to you. I shall try to
reply to all those questions. Once you too were maintained by your four legs, and you increased happiness
all over the universe by the mercy of the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord Himself, and the executor of such laws is
Dharmaraja, or Yamaraja. Such principles work fully in the age of Satya-yuga; in the Treta-yuga they are
reduced by a fraction of one fourth; in the Dvapara-yuga they are reduced to one half, and in the Kaliyuga
they are reduced to one fourth, gradually diminishing to the zero point, and then devastation takes
place. Happiness in the world depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principles,
individually or collectively. The best part of valor is to maintain the principles despite all kinds of odds.
Thus one can be happy during the span of life and ultimately return to Godhead.

<h2>Translation</h2>
In Him reside (1) truthfulness, (2) cleanliness, (3) intolerance of another's unhappiness, (4) the power
to control anger, (5) self-satisfaction, (6) straightforwardness, (7) steadiness of mind, (8) control of the
sense organs, (9) responsibility, (10) equality, (11) tolerance, (12) equanimity, (13) faithfulness, (14)
knowledge, (15) absence of sense enjoyment, (16) leadership, (17) chivalry, (18) influence, (19) the
power to make everything possible, (20) the discharge of proper duty, (21) complete independence, (22)
dexterity, (23) fullness of all beauty, (24) serenity, (25) kindheartedness, (26) ingenuity, (27) gentility,
(28) magnanimity, (29) determination, (30) perfection in all knowledge, (31) proper execution, (32)
possession of all objects of enjoyment, (33) joyfulness, (34) immovability, (35) fidelity, (36) fame, (37)
worship, (38) pridelessness, (39) being (as the Personality of Godhead), (40) eternity, and many other
transcendental qualities which are eternally present and never to be separated from Him. That Personality
of Godhead, the reservoir of all goodness and beauty, Lord Sri Krsna, has now closed His transcendental
pastimes on the face of the earth. In His absence the age of Kali has spread its influence everywhere, so I
am sorry to see this condition of existence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder, still it would not be
possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva
has tried to expound the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with His numberless tongues, and
that for numberless years together it has been impossible to estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above
statement of the qualities of the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to see
Him. But even if it is so, the above qualities can be divided into many subheadings. According to Srila Jiva
Gosvami, the third quality, intolerance of another's unhappiness, can be subdivided into (1) protection of
the surrendered souls and (2) well wishes for the devotees. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord states that He
wants every soul to surrender unto Him only, and He assures everyone that if one does so He will give
protection from the reactions of all sins. Unsurrendered souls are not devotees of the Lord, and thus there
is no particular protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishes, and for those
who are actually engaged in loving transcendental service of the Lord, He gives particular attention. He
gives direction to such pure devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to
Godhead. By equality (10), the Lord is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays
over everyone. Yet there are many who are unable to take advantage of the sun's rays. Similarly, the Lord
says that surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Him, but unfortunate persons are
unable to accept this proposition, and therefore they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the
Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, the unfortunate living being, due to bad association only, is
unable to accept His instructions in toto, and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the wellwisher
for the devotees only. He appears to be partial to His devotees, but factually the matter rests on the
living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord.
The Lord never deviates from His word of honor. When He gives assurance for protection, the promise
is executed in all circumstances. It is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty
entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord's bona fide representative, the spiritual master. The rest is
carried on by the Lord without a break.
The responsibility of the Lord is also unique. The Lord has no responsibility because all His work is
done by His different appointed energies. But still He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying
different roles in His transcendental pastimes. As a boy, He was playing the part of a cowboy. As the son
of Nanda Maharaja, He discharged responsibility perfectly. Similarly, when He was playing the part of a
ksatriya as the son of Maharaja Vasudeva, He displayed all the skill of a martially spirited ksatriya. In
almost all cases, the ksatriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping. This sort of behavior for
a ksatriya is praiseworthy in the sense that a ksatriya must show his power of chivalry to his would-be
wife so that the daughter of a ksatriya can see the valor of her would-be husband. Even the Personality of
Godhead Sri Rama displayed such a spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bow,
called Haradhanur, and achieved the hand of Sitadevi, the mother of all opulence. The ksatriya spirit is
displayed during marriage festivals, and there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord Sri Krsna
discharged such responsibility fully because although He had more than sixteen thousand wives, in each
and every case He fought like a chivalrous ksatriya and thus secured a wife. To fight sixteen thousand
times to secure sixteen thousand wives is certainly possible only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Similarly, He displayed full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes.
The fourteenth quality, knowledge, can be further extended into five subheadings, namely (1)
intelligence, (2) gratefulness, (3) power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object
and time, (4) perfect knowledge of everything, and (5) knowledge of the self. Only fools are ungrateful to
their benefactors. The Lord, however, does not require benefit from anyone besides Himself because He is
full in Himself; still He feels benefited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to
His devotees for such unsophisticated, unconditional service and tries to reciprocate it by rendering
service, although the devotee also has no such desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord
is itself a transcendental benefit for the devotee, and therefore the devotee has nothing to expect from the
Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism sarvam khalv idam brahma, we can understand that the
Lord, by the omnipresent rays of His effulgence, called brahmajyoti, is all-pervading inside or outside of
everything, like the omnipresent material sky, and thus He is also omniscient.
As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, He has some special features that distinguish Him from all
other living beings, and over and above that He has some special attractive beautiful features by which He
attracts the mind of even Radharani, the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. He is known, therefore,
as Madana-mohana, or one who attracts the mind of even Cupid. Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhu has
scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord Sri Krsna is the
Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Parabrahman). He is omnipotent by His inconceivable
energies, and therefore He is the Yogesvara, or the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the
Yogesvara, His eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The nondevotee
class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge because they are satisfied to reach up to
His eternal form of knowledge. All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that
all other knowledge is ever insufficient, flexible and measurable, whereas the knowledge of the Lord is
ever fixed and unfathomable. Srila Suta Gosvami affirms in the Bhagavatam that although He was
observed by the citizens of Dvaraka every day, they were ever increasingly anxious to see Him again and
again. The living beings can appreciate the qualities of the Lord as the ultimate goal, but they cannot
attain the status quo of such equality. This material world is a product of the mahat-tattva, which is a state
of the Lord's dreaming condition in His yoga-nidra mystic slumber in the Causal Ocean, and yet the
whole creation appears to be a factual presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord's dreaming
conditions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything under His transcendental
control, and thus whenever and wherever He does appear, He does so in His fullness.
The Lord, being all that is described above, maintains the affairs of the creation, and by His so doing He
gives salvation even to His enemies who are killed by Him. He is attractive even to the topmost liberated
soul, and thus He is worshipable even by Brahma and Siva, the greatest of all demigods. Even in His
incarnation of purusa-avatara He is the Lord of the creative energy. The creative material energy is
working under His direction, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (9.10). He is the control switch of the
material energy, and to control the material energy in the innumerable universes, He is the root cause of
innumerable incarnations in all the universes. There are more than five hundred thousand incarnations of
Manu in only one universe, besides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual world,
however, beyond the mahat-tattva, there is no question of incarnations, but there are plenary expansions
of the Lord in different Vaikunthas. The planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of
those within the innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva. And all the Narayana forms of the Lord are
but expansions of His Vasudeva feature, and thus He is Vasudeva, Narayana and Krsna simultaneously. He
is sri-krsna govinda hare murare, he natha narayana vasudeva, all in one. His qualities, therefore, cannot
be counted by anyone, however great one may be.
