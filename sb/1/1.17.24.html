<h2>Translation</h2>
In the age of Satya [truthfulness] your four legs were established by the four principles of austerity,
cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. But it appears that three of your legs are broken due to rampant
irreligion in the form of pride, lust for women, and intoxication.

<h2>Purport</h2>
The deluding energy, or material nature, can act upon the living beings proportionately in terms of the
living beings' falling prey to the deluding attraction of maya. Moths are captivated by the glaring
brightness of light, and thus they become prey to the fire. Similarly, the deluding energy is always
captivating the conditioned souls to become prey to the fire of delusion, and the Vedic scriptures warn the
conditioned souls not to become prey to delusion but to get rid of it. The Vedas warn us to go not to the
darkness of ignorance but to the progressive path of light. The Lord Himself also warns that the deluding
power of material energy is too powerful to overcome, but one who completely surrenders unto the Lord
can easily do so. But to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is also not very easy. Such surrender is
possible by persons of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. These four principles of advanced
civilization were remarkable features in the age of Satya. In that age, every human being was practically a
qualified brahmana of the highest order, and in the social orders of life they were all paramahamsas, or
the topmost in the renounced order. By cultural standing, the human beings were not at all subjected to
the deluding energy. Such strong men of character were competent enough to get away from the clutches
of maya. But gradually, as the basic principles of brahminical culture, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy
and truthfulness, became curtailed by proportionate development of pride, attachment for women and
intoxication, the path of salvation or the path of transcendental bliss retreated far, far away from human
society. With the progression of the age of Kali, people are becoming very proud, and attached to women
and intoxication. By the influence of the age of Kali, even a pauper is proud of his penny, the women are
always dressed in an overly attractive fashion to victimize the minds of men, and the man is addicted to
drinking wine, smoking, drinking tea and chewing tobacco, etc. All these habits, or so-called
advancement of civilization, are the root causes of all irreligiosities, and therefore it is not possible to
check corruption, bribery and nepotism. Man cannot check all these evils simply by statutory acts and
police vigilance, but he can cure the disease of the mind by the proper medicine, namely advocating the
principles of brahminical culture or the principles of austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness.
Modern civilization and economic development are creating a new situation of poverty and scarcity with
the result of blackmailing the consumer's commodities. If the leaders and the rich men of the society
spend fifty percent of their accumulated wealth mercifully for the misled mass of people and educate them
in God consciousness, the knowledge of Bhagavatam, certainly the age of Kali will be defeated in its
attempt to entrap the conditioned souls. We must always remember that false pride, or too high an
estimation of one's own values of life, undue attachment to women or association with them, and
intoxication will divert human civilization from the path of peace, however much the people clamor for
peace in the world. The preaching of the Bhagavatam principles will automatically render all men austere,
clean both inside and outside, merciful to the suffering, and truthful in daily behavior. That is the way of
correcting the flaws of human society, which are very prominently exhibited at the present moment.
