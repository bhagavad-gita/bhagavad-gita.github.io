te sadhu-krta-sarvartha
jnatvatyantikam atmanah
manasa dharayam asur
vaikuntha-caranambujam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
te--all of them; sadhu-krta--having performed everything worthy of a saint; sarva-arthah--that which
includes everything worthy; jnatva--knowing it well; atyantikam--the ultimate; atmanah--of the living
being; manasa--within the mind; dharayam asuh--sustained; vaikuntha--the Lord of the spiritual sky;
carana-ambujam--the lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
They all had performed all the principles of religion and as a result rightly decided that the lotus feet of
the Lord Sri Krsna are the supreme goal of all. Therefore they meditated upon His feet without
interruption.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita (7.28) the Lord says that only those who have done pious deeds in previous lives
and have become freed from the results of all impious acts can concentrate upon the lotus feet of the
Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. The Pandavas, not only in this life but also in their previous lives, had always
performed the supreme pious work, and thus they are ever free from all the reactions of impious work. It
is quite reasonable, therefore, that they concentrated their minds upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord
Sri Krsna. According to Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti, dharma, artha, kama and moksa principles are accepted
by persons who are not free from the results of impious action. Such persons affected with the
contaminations of the above four principles cannot at once accept the lotus feet of the Lord in the
spiritual sky. The Vaikuntha world is situated far beyond the material sky. The material sky is under the
management of Durga Devi, or the material energy of the Lord, but the Vaikuntha world is managed by
the personal energy of the Lord.

visuddha--purified; dhisanah--by intelligence; pare--unto the Transcendence; tasmin--in that; narayana--

kalmasah--material contaminations; sthanam--abode; virajena--without material passion; atmana eva--by
the selfsame body; hi--certainly.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus by pure consciousness due to constant devotional remembrance, they attained the spiritual sky,
which is ruled over by the Supreme Narayana, Lord Krsna. This is attained only by those who meditate
upon the one Supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Sri Krsna, known as Goloka
Vrndavana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. But the
Pandavas, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode in their very same
bodies.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, a person freed from the three modes of material qualities, namely
goodness, passion and ignorance, and situated in transcendence can reach the highest perfection of life
without change of body. Srila Sanatana Gosvami in his Hari-bhakti-vilasa says that a person, whatever he
may be, can attain the perfection of a twice-born brahmana by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary
actions under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, exactly as a chemist can turn gun metal into
gold by chemical manipulation. It is therefore the actual guidance that matters in the process of becoming
a brahmana, even without change of body, or in going back to Godhead without change of body. Srila Jiva
Gosvami remarks that the word hi used in this connection positively affirms this truth, and there is no
doubt about this factual position. The Bhagavad-gita (14.26) also affirms this statement of Srila Jiva
Gosvami when the Lord says that anyone who executes devotional service systematically without
deviation can attain the perfection of Brahman by surpassing the contamination of the three modes of
material nature, and when the Brahman perfection is still more advanced by the selfsame execution of
devotional service, there is no doubt at all that one can attain the supreme spiritual planet, Goloka
Vrndavana, without change of body, as we have already discussed in connection with the Lord's returning
to His abode without a change of body.
