<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who are actually intelligent and philosophically inclined should endeavor only for that
purposeful end which is not obtainable even by wandering from the topmost planet [Brahmaloka] down
to the lowest planet [Patala]. As far as happiness derived from sense enjoyment is concerned, it can be
obtained automatically in course of time, just as in course of time we obtain miseries even though we do
not desire them.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every man everywhere is trying to obtain the greatest amount of sense enjoyment by various endeavors.
Some men are busy engaged in trade, industry, economic development, political supremacy, etc., and
some of them are engaged in fruitive work to become happy in the next life by attaining higher planets. It
is said that on the moon the inhabitants are fit for greater sense enjoyment by drinking soma-rasa, and the
Pitrloka is obtained by good charitable work. So there are various programs for sense enjoyment, either
during this life or in the life after death. Some are trying to reach the moon or other planets by some
mechanical arrangement, for they are very anxious to get into such planets without doing good work. But
it is not to happen. By the law of the Supreme, different places are meant for different grades of living
beings according to the work they have performed. By good work only, as prescribed in the scriptures, can
one obtain birth in a good family, opulence, good education and good bodily features. We see also that
even in this life one obtains a good education or money by good work. Similarly, in our next birth we get
such desirable positions only by good work. Otherwise, it would not so happen that two persons born in
the same place at the same time are seen differently placed according to previous work. But all such
material positions are impermanent. The positions in the topmost Brahmaloka and in the lowest Patala are
also changeable according to our own work. The philosophically inclined person must not be tempted by
such changeable positions. He should try to get into the permanent life of bliss and knowledge where he
will not be forced to come back again to the miserable material world, either in this or that planet.
Miseries and mixed happiness are two features of material life, and they are obtained in Brahmaloka and
in other lokas also. They are obtained in the life of the demigods and also in the life of the dogs and hogs.
The miseries and mixed happiness of all living beings are only of different degree and quality, but no one
is free from the miseries of birth, death, old age and disease. Similarly, everyone has his destined
happiness also. No one can get more or less of these things simply by personal endeavors. Even if they are
obtained, they can be lost again. One should not, therefore, waste time with these flimsy things; one
should only endeavor to go back to Godhead. That should be the mission of everyone's life.
