<h2>Translation</h2>
All the great sages then glorified Lord Sri Krsna, who was present there, by confidential Vedic hymns.
Then all of them returned to their respective hermitages, bearing always Lord Krsna within their hearts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees of the Lord are always in the heart of the Lord, and the Lord is always in the hearts of the
devotees. That is the sweet relation between the Lord and His devotees. Due to unalloyed love and
devotion for the Lord, the devotees always see Him within themselves, and the Lord also, although He has
nothing to do and nothing to aspire to, is always busy in attending to the welfare of His devotees. For the
ordinary living beings the law of nature is there for all actions and reactions, but He is always anxious to
put His devotees on the right path. The devotees, therefore, are under the direct care of the Lord. And the
Lord also voluntarily puts Himself under the care of His devotees only. So all the sages, headed by
Vyasadeva, were devotees of the Lord, and therefore they chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral
ceremony just to please the Lord, who was present there personally. All the Vedic hymns are chanted to
please Lord Krsna. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (15.15). All the Vedas, Upanisads, Vedanta,
etc., are seeking Him only, and all hymns are for glorifying Him only. The sages, therefore, performed the
exact acts suitable for the purpose, and they happily departed for their respective hermitages.
