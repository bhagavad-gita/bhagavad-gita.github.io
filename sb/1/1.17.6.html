kim anyair asad-alapair
ayuso yad asad-vyayah
SYNONYMS
athava--otherwise; asya--of His (Lord Krsna's); pada-ambhoja--lotus feet; makaranda-liham--of those
who lick the honey from such a lotus flower; satam--of those who are to exist eternally; kim anyaih--what
is the use of anything else; asat--illusory; alapaih--topics; ayusah--of the duration of life; yat--that which
is; asat-vyayah--unnecessary waste of life.
TRANSLATION
The devotees of the Lord are accustomed to licking up the honey available from the lotus feet of the
Lord. What is the use of topics which simply waste one's valuable life?
PURPORT
Lord Krsna and His devotees are both on the transcendental plane; therefore the topics of Lord Krsna
and of His pure devotees are equally good. The Battle of Kuruksetra is full of politics and diplomacy, but
because the topics are related with Lord Krsna, the Bhagavad-gita is therefore adored all over the world.
There is no need to eradicate politics, economics, sociology, etc., which are mundane to the mundaners.
To a pure devotee, who is actually related with the Lord, such mundane things are transcendental if
dovetailed with the Lord or with His pure devotees. We have heard and talked about the activities of the
Pandavas, and we now are dealing with the topics of Maharaja Pariksit, but because all these topics are
related to the Lord Sri Krsna, they are all transcendental, and pure devotees have great interest in hearing
them. We have already discussed this matter in connection with the prayers of Bhismadeva.
Our duration of life is not very long, and there is no certainty of when we shall be ordered to leave
everything for the next stage. Thus it is our duty to see that not a moment of our life is wasted in topics
which are not related with Lord Krsna. Any topic, however pleasant, is not worth hearing if it is devoid of
its relation to Krsna.
The spiritual planet, Goloka Vrndavana, the eternal abode of Lord Krsna, is shaped like the whorl of a
lotus flower. Even when the Lord descends to any one of the mundane planets, He does so by manifesting
His own abode as it is. Thus His feet remain always on the same big whorl of the lotus flower. His feet are
also as beautiful as the lotus flower. Therefore it is said that Lord Krsna has lotus feet.
A living being is eternal by constitution. He is, so to speak, in the whirlpool of birth and death due to
his contact with material energy. Freed from such material energy, a living entity is liberated and is
eligible to return home, back to Godhead. Those who want to live forever without changing their material
bodies should not waste valuable time with topics other than those relating to Lord Krsna and His
devotees.
