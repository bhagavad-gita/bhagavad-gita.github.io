TRANSLATION
Thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness, the man whose mind has been enlivened by
contact with devotional service to the Lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the Personality of
Godhead in the stage of liberation from all material association.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita (7.3) it is said that out of many thousands of ordinary men, one fortunate man
endeavors for perfection in life. Mostly men are conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance, and
thus they are engaged always in lust, desire, hankerings, ignorance and sleep. Out of many such manlike
animals, there is actually a man who knows the responsibility of human life and thus tries to make life
perfect by following the prescribed duties. And out of many thousands of such persons who have thus
attained success in human life, one may know scientifically about the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna.
In the same Bhagavad-gita (18.55) it is also said that scientific knowledge of Sri Krsna is understood only
by the process of devotional service (bhakti-yoga).
The very same thing is confirmed herein in the above words. No ordinary man, or even one who has
attained success in human life, can know scientifically or perfectly the Personality of Godhead. Perfection
of human life is attained when one can understand that he is not the product of matter but is in fact spirit.
And as soon as one understands that he has nothing to do with matter, he at once ceases his material
hankerings and becomes enlivened as a spiritual being. This attainment of success is possible when one is
above the modes of passion and ignorance, or, in other words, when one is actually a brahmana by
qualification. A brahmana is the symbol of sattva-guna, or the mode of goodness. And others, who are not
in the mode of goodness, are either ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras or less than the sudras. The brahminical
stage is the highest stage of human life because of its good qualities. So one cannot be a devotee unless
one at least qualifies as a brahmana. The devotee is already a brahmana by action. But that is not the end
of it. As referred to above, such a brahmana has to become a Vaisnava in fact to be actually in the
transcendental stage. A pure Vaisnava is a liberated soul and is transcendental even to the position of a
brahmana. In the material stage even a brahmana is also a conditioned soul because although in the
brahminical stage the conception of Brahman or transcendence is realized, scientific knowledge of the
Supreme Lord is lacking. One has to surpass the brahminical stage and reach the vasudeva stage to
understand the Personality of Godhead Krsna. The science of the Personality of Godhead is the subject
matter for study by the postgraduate students in the spiritual line. Foolish men, or men with a poor fund
of knowledge, do not understand the Supreme Lord, and they interpret Krsna according to their
respective whims. The fact is, however, that one cannot understand the science of the Personality of
Godhead unless one is freed from the contamination of the material modes, even up to the stage of a
brahmana. When a qualified brahmana factually becomes a Vaisnava, in the enlivened state of liberation
he can know what is actually the Personality of Godhead.
