<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tam menire 'bala mudhah
strainam canuvratam rahah
apramana-vido bhartur
isvaram matayo yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--unto Lord Sri Krsna; menire--took it for granted; abalah--delicate; mudhah--because of simplicity;
strainam--one who is dominated by his wife; ca--also; anuvratam--follower; rahah--lonely place;
apramana-vidah--unaware of the extent of glories; bhartuh--of their husband; isvaram--the supreme
controller; matayah--thesis; yatha--as it is.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The simple and delicate women truly thought that Lord Sri Krsna, their beloved husband, followed
them and was dominated by them. They were unaware of the extent of the glories of their husband, as the
atheists are unaware of Him as the supreme controller.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even the transcendental wives of Lord Sri Krsna did not know completely the unfathomable glories of
the Lord. This ignorance is not mundane because there is some action of the internal potency of the Lord
in the exchange of feelings between Him and His eternal associates. The Lord exchanges transcendental
relations in five ways, as proprietor, master, friend, son and lover, and in each of these pastimes He plays
fully by the potency of yogamaya, the internal potency. He plays exactly like an equal friend with the
cowherd boys or even with friends like Arjuna. He plays exactly like a son in the presence of Yasodamata,
He plays exactly like a lover in the presence of the cowherd damsels, and He plays exactly like a husband
in the presence of the queens of Dvaraka. Such devotees of the Lord never think of the Lord as the
Supreme, but think of Him exactly as a common friend, a pet son, or a lover or husband very much dear
to heart and soul. That is the relation between the Lord and His transcendental devotees, who act as His
associates in the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable Vaikuntha planets. When the Lord descends,
He does so along with His entourage to display a complete picture of the transcendental world, where
pure love and devotion for the Lord prevail without any mundane tinge of lording it over the creation of
the Lord. Such devotees of the Lord are all liberated souls, perfect representations of the marginal or
internal potency in complete negation of the influence of the external potency. The wives of Lord Krsna
were made to forget the immeasurable glories of the Lord by the internal potency so that there might not
be any flaw of exchange, and they took it for granted that the Lord was a henpecked husband, always
following them in lonely places. In other words, even the personal associates of the Lord do not know
Him perfectly well, so what do the thesis writers or mental speculators know about the transcendental
glories of the Lord? The mental speculators present different theses as to His becoming the causes of the
creation, the ingredients of the creation, or the material and efficient cause of the creation, etc., but all this
is but partial knowledge about the Lord. Factually they are as ignorant as the common man. The Lord can
be known by the mercy of the Lord only, and by no other means. But since the dealings of the Lord with
His wives are based on pure transcendental love and devotion, the wives are all on the transcendental
plane without material contamination.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Eleventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Lord Krsna's Entrance into Dvaraka."
