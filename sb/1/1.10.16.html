<h2>Translation</h2>
Out of a loving desire to see the Lord, the royal ladies of the Kurus got up on top of the palace, and
smiling with affection and shyness, they showered flowers upon the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Shyness is a particular extra-natural beauty of the fair sex, and it commands respect from the opposite
sex. This custom was observed even during the days of the Mahabharata, i.e., more than five thousand
years ago. It is only the less intelligent persons not well versed in the history of the world who say that
observance of separation of female from male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India. This
incident from the Mahabharata period proves definitely that the ladies of the palace observed strict parda
(restricted association with men), and instead of coming down in the open air where Lord Krsna and
others were assembled, the ladies of the palace went up on the top of the palace and from there paid their
respects to Lord Krsna by showers of flowers. It is definitely stated here that the ladies were smiling there
on the top of the palace, checked by shyness. This shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sex, and it
enhances their beauty and prestige, even if they are of a less important family or even if they are less
attractive. We have practical experience of this fact. A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many
respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness. Half-naked ladies in the street do not
command any respect, but a shy sweeper's wife commands respect from all.
Human civilization, as conceived of by the sages of India, is to help one free himself from the clutches of
illusion. The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earth, water,
fire, air, etc. But because there is the association of the living spark with matter, it appears to be beautiful.
No one is attracted by an earthen doll, even if it is most perfectly prepared to attract the attention of
others. The dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful
woman. Therefore, the conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautiful, and because of the soul's beauty one
is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. The Vedic wisdom, therefore, forbids us to be attracted by
false beauty. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorance, the Vedic civilization allows very
restricted mixing of woman and man. They say that the woman is considered to be the fire, and the man is
considered to be the butter. The butter must melt in association with fire, and therefore they may be
brought together only when it is necessary. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. It is
nature's gift, and it must be utilized.
