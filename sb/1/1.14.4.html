<h2>Translation</h2>
All ordinary transactions and dealings became polluted with cheating, even between friends. And in
familial affairs, there was always misunderstanding between fathers, mothers and sons, between wellwishers,
and between brothers. Even between husband and wife there was always strain and quarrel.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malpractice, namely errors, insanity,
inability and cheating. These are signs of imperfection, and out of the four the propensity to cheat others
is most prominent. And this cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned
souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material
world. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is
conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the Supreme Being, and thus it is always good for
him to remain subservient, instead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the Supreme Lord. In
the conditioned state the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he
surveys, which he never becomes, and therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheating, even with
his nearest and most intimate relations. In such an unsatisfactory state of affairs, there is no harmony,
even between father and sons or between husband and wife. But all these contending difficulties can be
mitigated by one process, and that is the devotional service of the Lord. The world of hypocrisy can be
checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. Maharaja
Yudhisthira, having observed the disparities, conjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth.
