<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
vijnanatmani samyojya
ksetrajne pravilapya tam
brahmany atmanam adhare
ghatambaram ivambare
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vijnana--purified identity; atmani--in intelligence; samyojya--perfectly fixing; ksetra-jne--in the matter
of the living being; pravilapya--merging; tam--him; brahmani--in the Supreme; atmanam--pure living
being; adhare--in the reservoir; ghata-ambaram--sky within the block; iva--like; ambare--in the supreme
sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Dhrtarastra will have to amalgamate his pure identity with intelligence and then merge into the
Supreme Being with knowledge of his qualitative oneness, as a living entity, with the Supreme Brahman.
Being freed from the blocked sky, he will have to rise to the spiritual sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living being, by his desiring to lord it over the material world and declining to cooperate with the
Supreme Lord, contacts the sum total of the material world, namely the mahat-tattva, and from the mahattattva
his false identity with the material world, intelligence, mind and senses is developed. This covers
his pure spiritual identity. By the yogic process, when his pure identity is realized in self-realization, one
has to revert to the original position by amalgamating the five gross elements and the subtle elements,
mind and intelligence, into the mahat-tattva again. Thus getting freed from the clutches of the mahattattva,
he has to merge in the existence of the Supersoul. In other words, he has to realize that
qualitatively he is nondifferent from the Supersoul, and thus he transcends the material sky by his pure
identical intelligence and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is
the highest perfectional development of spiritual identity, which was attained by Dhrtarastra by the grace
of Vidura and the Lord. The Lord's mercy was bestowed upon him by his personal contact with Vidura,
and when he was actually practicing the instructions of Vidura, the Lord helped him to attain the highest
perfectional stage.
A pure devotee of the Lord does not live on any planet of the material sky, nor does he feel any contact
with material elements. His so-called material body does not exist, being surcharged with the spiritual
current of the Lord's identical interest, and thus he is permanently freed from all contaminations of the
sum total of the mahat-tattva. He is always in the spiritual sky, which he attains by being transcendental
to the sevenfold material covering by the effect of his devotional service. The conditioned souls are within
the coverings, whereas the liberated soul is far beyond the cover.
