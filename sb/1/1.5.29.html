<h2>Translation</h2>
I was very much attached to those sages. I was gentle in behavior, and all my sins were eradicated in
their service. In my heart I had strong faith in them. I had subjugated the senses, and I was strictly
following them with body and mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These are the necessary qualifications of a prospective candidate who can expect to be elevated to the
position of a pure unadulterated devotee. Such a candidate must always seek the association of pure
devotees. One should not be misled by a pseudodevotee. He himself must be plain and gentle to receive
the instructions of such a pure devotee. A pure devotee is a completely surrendered soul unto the
Personality of Godhead. He knows the Personality of Godhead as the supreme proprietor and all others as
His servitors. And by the association of pure devotees only, one can get rid of all sins accumulated by
mundane association. A neophyte devotee must faithfully serve the pure devotee, and he should be very
much obedient and strictly follow the instructions. These are the signs of a devotee who is determined to
achieve success even in the existing duration of life.
