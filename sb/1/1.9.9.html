<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tan sametan maha-bhagan
upalabhya vasuttamah
pujayam asa dharma-jno
desa-kala-vibhagavit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tan--all of them; sametan--assembled together; maha-bhagan--all greatly powerful; upalabhya--having
received; vasu-uttamah--the best among the Vasus (Bhismadeva); pujayam asa--welcomed; dharma-jnah--
one who knows religious principles; desa--place; kala--time; vibhaga-vit--one who knows the adjustment
of place and time.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bhismadeva, who was the best amongst the eight Vasus, received and welcomed all the great and
powerful rsis who were assembled there, for he knew perfectly all the religious principles according to
time and place.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Expert religionists know perfectly well how to adjust religious principles in terms of time and place. All
the great acaryas or religious preachers or reformers of the world executed their mission by adjustment of
religious principles in terms of time and place. There are different climates and situations in different
parts of the world, and if one has to discharge his duties to preach the message of the Lord, he must be
expert in adjusting things in terms of the time and place. Bhismadeva was one of the twelve great
authorities in preaching this cult of devotional service, and therefore he could receive and welcome all the
powerful sages assembled there at his deathbed from all parts of the universe. He was certainly unable at
that time to welcome and receive them physically because he was neither at his home nor in a normal
healthy condition. But he was quite fit by the activities of his sound mind, and therefore he could utter
sweet words with hearty expressions, and all of them were well received. One can perform one's duty by
physical work, by mind and by words. And he knew well how to utilize them in the proper place, and
therefore there was no difficulty for him to receive them, although physically unfit.
