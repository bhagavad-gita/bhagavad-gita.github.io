TRANSLATION
Although they were impartial by nature, those followers of the Vedanta blessed me with their causeless
mercy. As far as I was concerned, I was self-controlled and had no attachment for sports, even though I
was a boy. In addition, I was not naughty, and I did not speak more than required.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, "All the Vedas are searching after Me." Lord Sri Caitanya says that in
the Vedas the subject matters are only three, namely to establish the relation of the living entities with the
Personality of Godhead, perform the relative duties in devotional service and thus achieve the ultimate
goal, back to Godhead. As such, vedanta-vadis, or the followers of the Vedanta, indicate the pure devotees
of the Personality of Godhead. Such vedanta-vadis, or the bhakti-vedantas, are impartial in distributing
the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them no one is enemy or friend; no one is
educated or uneducated. No one is especially favorable, and no one is unfavorable. The bhakti-vedantas
see that the people in general are wasting time in false sensuous things. Their business is to get the
ignorant mass of people to reestablish their lost relationship with the Personality of Godhead. By such
endeavor, even the most forgotten soul is roused up to the sense of spiritual life, and thus being initiated
by the bhakti-vedantas, the people in general gradually progress on the path of transcendental realization.
So the vedanta-vadis initiated the boy even before he became self-controlled and was detached from
childish sporting, etc. But before the initiation, he (the boy) became more and more advanced in
discipline, which is very essential for one who wishes to make progress in the line. In the system of
varnasrama-dharma, which is the beginning of actual human life, small boys after five years of age are sent
to become brahmacari at the guru's asrama, where these things are systematically taught to boys, be they
king's sons or sons of ordinary citizens. The training was compulsory not only to create good citizens of
the state, but also to prepare the boy's future life for spiritual realization. The irresponsible life of sense
enjoyment was unknown to the children of the followers of the varnasrama system. The boy was even
injected with spiritual acumen before being placed by the father in the womb of the mother. Both the
father and the mother were responsible for the boy's success in being liberated from the material bondage.
That is the process of successful family planning. It is to beget children for complete perfection. Without
being self-controlled, without being disciplined and without being fully obedient, no one can become
successful in following the instructions of the spiritual master, and without doing so, no one is able to go
back to Godhead.
