<h2>Text</h2>
nyarundhann udgalad baspam
autkanthyad devaki-sute
niryaty agaran no 'bhadram
iti syad bandhava-striyah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nyarundhan--checking with great difficulty; udgalat--overflowing; baspam--tears; autkanthyat--because
of great anxiety; devaki-sute--unto the son of Devaki; niryati--having come out; agarat--from the palace;
nah--not; abhadram--inauspiciousness; iti--thus; syat--may happen; bandhava--relative; striyah--ladies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The female relatives, whose eyes were flooded with tears out of anxiety for Krsna, came out of the
palace. They could stop their tears only with great difficulty. They feared that tears would cause
misfortune at the time of departure.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There were hundreds of ladies in the palace of Hastinapura. All of them were affectionate to Krsna. All
of them were relatives also. When they saw that Krsna was going away from the palace for His native
place, they were very anxious for Him, and as usual tears began to roll down their cheeks. They thought,
at the same time, that tears at that moment might be a cause of misfortune for Krsna; therefore they
wanted to check them. This was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked. Therefore,
they smeared their tears in their eyes, and their hearts throbbed. Therefore ladies who were the wives and
daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with Krsna. But all of
them heard of Him and His great activities, and thus they thought of Him, talked of Him, His name, fame,
etc., and became affectionate also, like those who were in direct contact. Therefore directly or indirectly
anyone who thinks of Krsna, talks of Krsna or worships Krsna becomes attached to Him. Because Krsna is
absolute, there is no difference between His name, form, quality, etc. Our intimate relation with Krsna can
be confidentially revived by our talking of, hearing of, or remembering Him. It is so done due to spiritual
potency.
