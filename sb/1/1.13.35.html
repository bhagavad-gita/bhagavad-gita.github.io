<h2>Text</h2>
suta uvaca
krpaya sneha-vaiklavyat
suto viraha-karsitah
atmesvaram acaksano
na pratyahatipiditah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sutah uvaca--Suta Gosvami said; krpaya--out of full compassion; sneha-vaiklavyat--mental derangement
due to profound affection; sutah--Sanjaya; viraha-karsitah--distressed by separation; atma-isvaram--his
master; acaksanah--having not seen; na--did not; pratyaha--replied; ati-piditah--being too aggrieved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: Because of compassion and mental agitation, Sanjaya, not having seen his own
master, Dhrtarastra, was aggrieved and could not properly reply to Maharaja Yudhisthira.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sanjaya was the personal assistant of Maharaja Dhrtarastra for a very long time, and thus he had the
opportunity to study the life of Dhrtarastra. And when he saw at last that Dhrtarastra had left home
without his knowledge, his sorrows had no bound. He was fully compassionate toward Dhrtarastra
because in the game of the Battle of Kuruksetra, King Dhrtarastra had lost everything, men and money,
and at last the King and the Queen had to leave home in utter frustration. He studied the situation in his
own way because he did not know that the inner vision of Dhrtarastra has been awakened by Vidura and
that therefore he had left home in enthusiastic cheerfulness for a better life after departure from the dark
well of home. Unless one is convinced of a better life after renunciation of the present life, one cannot
stick to the renounced order of life simply by artificial dress or staying out of the home.
