<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
kalasya ca gatim raudram
viparyastartu-dharminah
papiyasim nrnam vartam
krodha-lobhanrtatmanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kalasya--of eternal time; ca--also; gatim--direction; raudram--fearful; viparyasta--reversed; rtu--seasonal;
dharminah--regularities; papiyasim--sinful; nrnam--of the human being; vartam--means of livelihood;
krodha--anger; lobha--greed; anrta--falsehood; atmanam--of the people.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He saw that the direction of eternal time had changed, and this was very fearful. There were disruptions
in the seasonal regularities. The people in general had become very greedy, angry and deceitful. And he
saw that they were adopting foul means of livelihood.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When civilization is disconnected from the loving relation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
symptoms like changes of seasonal regulations, foul means of livelihood, greed, anger and fraudulence
become rampant. The change of seasonal regulations refers to one season's atmosphere becoming manifest
in another season--for example the rainy season's being transferred to autumn, or the fructification of
fruits and flowers from one season in another season. A godless man is invariably greedy, angry and
fraudulent. Such a man can earn his livelihood by any means, black or white. During the reign of
Maharaja Yudhisthira, all the above symptoms were conspicuous by their absence. But Maharaja
Yudhisthira was astonished to experience even a slight change in the godly atmosphere of his kingdom,
and at once he suspected the disappearance of the Lord. Foul means of livelihood implies deviation from
one's occupational duty. There are prescribed duties for everyone, such as the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya
and sudra, but anyone who deviates from his prescribed duty and declares another's duty to be his own is
following a foul and improper duty. A man becomes too greedy for wealth and power when he has no
higher objective in life and when he thinks that this earthly life of a few years is all in all. Ignorance is the
cause for all these anomalies in human society, and to remove this ignorance, especially in this age of
degradation, the powerful sun is there to distribute light in the shape of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
