<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord was pacified after killing those kings who were burdensome to the earth. They were puffed up
with their military strength, their horses, elephants, chariots, infantry, etc. He Himself was not a party in
the fight. He simply created hostility between the powerful administrators, and they fought amongst
themselves. He was like the wind which causes friction between bamboos and so sparks a fire.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated above, the living beings are not factual enjoyers of things which are manifested as God's
creation. The Lord is the genuine proprietor and enjoyer of everything manifested in His creation.
Unfortunately, influenced by the deluding energy, the living being becomes a false enjoyer under the
dictation of the modes of nature. Puffed up by such a false sense of becoming God, the deluded living
being increases his material strength by so many activities and thus becomes the burden of the earth, so
much so that the earth becomes completely uninhabitable by the sane. This state of affairs is called
dharmasya glani, or misuse of the energy of the human being. When such misuse of human energy is
prominent, the saner living beings become perturbed by the awkward situation created by the vicious
administrators, who are simply burdens of the earth, and the Lord appears by His internal potency just to
save the saner section of humanity and to alleviate the burden due to the earthly administrators in
different parts of the world. He does not favor either of the unwanted administrators, but by His potential
power He creates hostility between such unwanted administrators, as the air creates fire in the forest by
the friction of the bamboos. The fire in the forest takes place automatically by the force of the air, and
similarly the hostility between different groups of politicians takes place by the unseen design of the Lord.
The unwanted administrators, puffed up by false power and military strength, thus become engaged in
fighting amongst themselves over ideological conflicts and so exhaust themselves of all powers. The
history of the world reflects this factual will of the Lord, and it will continue to be enacted until the living
beings are attached to the service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita this fact is very vividly described (Bg.
7.14). It is said, "The deluding energy is My potency, and thus it is not possible for the dependent living
beings to supersede the strength of the material modes. But those who take shelter in Me [the Personality
of Godhead Sri Krsna] can cross over the gigantic ocean of material energy." This means that no one can
establish peace and prosperity in the world by fruitive activities or by speculative philosophy or ideology.
The only way is to surrender unto the Supreme Lord and thus become free from the illusion of the
deluding energy.
Unfortunately persons who are engaged in destructive work are unable to surrender to the Personality
of Godhead. They are all fools of the first order; they are the lowest of the human species of life; they are
robbed of their knowledge, although apparently they seem to be academically educated. They are all of
the demoniac mentality, always challenging the supreme power of the Lord. Those who are very
materialistic, always hankering after material power and strength, are undoubtedly fools of the first order
because they have no information of the living energy, and being ignorant of that supreme spiritual
science, they are absorbed in material science, which ends with the end of the material body. They are the
lowest of human beings because the human life is especially meant for reestablishing the lost relation with
the Lord, and they miss this opportunity by being engaged in material activities. They are robbed of their
knowledge because even after prolonged speculation they cannot reach to the stage of knowing the
Personality of Godhead, the summum bonum of everything. And all of them are men of demoniac
principle, and they suffer the consequences, as did such materialistic heroes as Ravana, Hiranyakasipu,
Kamsa and others.
