Vedas with illustrative narrations; sa-itihasani--along with the histories; ca--and; anagha--freed from all

<h2>Translation</h2>
The sages said: Respected Suta Gosvami, you are completely free from all vice. You are well versed in all
the scriptures famous for religious life, and in the Puranas and the histories as well, for you have gone
through them under proper guidance and have also explained them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A gosvami, or the bona fide representative of Sri Vyasadeva, must be free from all kinds of vices. The
four major vices of Kali-yuga are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) animal slaughter, (3) intoxication,
(4) speculative gambling of all sorts. A gosvami must be free from all these vices before he can dare sit on
the vyasasana. No one should be allowed to sit on the vyasasana who is not spotless in character and who
is not freed from the above-mentioned vices. He not only should be freed from all such vices, but must
also be well versed in all revealed scriptures or in the Vedas. The Puranas are also parts of the Vedas. And
histories like the Mahabharata or Ramayana are also parts of the Vedas. The acarya or the gosvami must
be well acquainted with all these literatures. To hear and explain them is more important than reading
them. One can assimilate the knowledge of the revealed scriptures only by hearing and explaining.
Hearing is called sravana, and explaining is called kirtana. The two processes of sravana and kirtana are of
primary importance to progressive spiritual life. Only one who has properly grasped the transcendental
knowledge from the right source by submissive hearing can properly explain the subject.
