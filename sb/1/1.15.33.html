<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prtha--Kunti; api--also; anusrutya--overhearing; dhananjaya--Arjuna; uditam--uttered by; nasam--end;
yadunam--of the Yadu dynasty; bhagavat--of the Personality of Godhead; gatim--disappearance; ca--also;
tam--all those; eka-anta--unalloyed; bhaktya--devotion; bhagavati--unto the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna;
adhoksaje--transcendence; nivesita-atma--with full attention; upararama--became released from;
samsrteh--material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kunti, after overhearing Arjuna's telling of the end of the Yadu dynasty and disappearance of Lord
Krsna, engaged in the devotional service of the transcendental Personality of Godhead with full attention
and thus gained release from the course of material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The setting of the sun does not mean the end of the sun. It means that the sun is out of our sight.
Similarly, the end of the mission of the Lord on a particular planet or universe only means that He is out
of our sight. The end of the Yadu dynasty also does not mean that it is annihilated. It disappears, along
with the Lord, out of our sight. As Maharaja Yudhisthira decided to prepare to go back to Godhead, so
also Kunti decided, and thus she fully engaged herself in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord
which guarantees one a passport for going back to Godhead after quitting this present material body. The
beginning of devotional service to the Lord is the beginning of spiritualizing the present body, and thus an
unalloyed devotee of the Lord loses all material contact in the present body. The abode of the Lord is not
a myth, as is thought by the unbelievers or ignorant people, but one cannot reach there by any material
means like a sputnik or space capsule. But one can certainly reach there after leaving this present body,
and one must prepare himself to go back to Godhead by practicing devotional service. That guarantees a
passport for going back to Godhead, and Kunti adopted it.
