<h2>Text</h2>
yad-anudhyasina yuktah
karma-granthi-nibandhanam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--which; anudhya--remembrance; asina--sword; yuktah--being equipped with; karma--reactionary
work; granthi--knot; nibandhanam--interknit; chindanti--cut; kovidah--intelligent; tasya--His; kah--who;
na--not; kuryat--shall do; katha--messages; ratim--attention.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
With sword in hand, intelligent men cut through the binding knots of reactionary work [karma] by
remembering the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, who will not pay attention to His message?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The contact of the spiritual spark with material elements creates a knot which must be cut if one wants
to be liberated from the actions and reactions of fruitive work. Liberation means freedom from the cycle
of reactionary work. This liberation automatically follows for one who constantly remembers the
transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This is because all the activities of the Supreme
Lord (His lila) are transcendental to the modes of the material energy. They are all-attractive spiritual
activities, and therefore constant association with the spiritual activities of the Supreme Lord gradually
spiritualizes the conditioned soul and ultimately severs the knot of material bondage.
Liberation from material bondage is, therefore, a by-product of devotional service. Attainment of
spiritual knowledge is not sufficient to insure liberation. Such knowledge must be overcoated with
devotional service so that ultimately the devotional service alone predominates. Then liberation is made
possible. Even the reactionary work of the fruitive workers can lead one to liberation when it is
overcoated with devotional service. Karma overcoated with devotional service is called karma-yoga.
Similarly, empirical knowledge overcoated with devotional service is called jnana-yoga. But pure bhaktiyoga
is independent of such karma and jnana because it alone can not only endow one with liberation
from conditional life but also award one the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
Therefore, any sensible man who is above the average man with a poor fund of knowledge must
constantly remember the Personality of Godhead by hearing about Him, by glorifying Him, by
remembering Him and by worshiping Him always, without cessation. That is the perfect way of devotional
service. The Gosvamis of Vrndavana, who were authorized by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to preach the
bhakti cult, rigidly followed this rule and made immense literatures of transcendental science for our
benefit. They have chalked out ways for all classes of men in terms of the different castes and orders of life
in pursuance of the teachings of Srimad-Bhagavatam and similar other authoritative scriptures.
