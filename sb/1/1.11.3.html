TRANSLATION
Maharaja Yudhisthira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhismadeva and Lord Sri Krsna,
the infallible, engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated.
Thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers.
PURPORT
The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the firstborn, was also prevalent
in those days when Maharaja Yudhisthira ruled the earth and seas. In those days the King of Hastinapura
(now part of New Delhi) was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Maharaja
Pariksit, the grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira. Maharaja Yudhisthira's younger brothers were acting as
his ministers and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious
brothers of the King. Maharaja Yudhisthira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Sri Krsna to rule
over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly
planets. The demigods like Indra, Candra, Surya, Varuna and Vayu are representative kings of different
planets of the universe, and similarly Maharaja Yudhisthira was also one of them, ruling over the kingdom
of the earth. Maharaja Yudhisthira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern
democracy. Maharaja Yudhisthira was instructed by Bhismadeva and the infallible Lord also, and therefore
he had full knowledge of everything in perfection.
The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even
if he is enlightened like Maharaja Yudhisthira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his
constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarreling because of
ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira had no ideology of
his own. He had but to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord's representative and the
authorized agent, Bhismadeva. It is instructed in the sastras that one should follow the great authority and
the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible for
Maharaja Yudhisthira to rule the whole world, including the seas, because the principles were infallible
and universally applicable to everyone. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can
follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to
everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and
can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal government. If the
person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is a fool, the government is a fool's paradise.
That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the
executive head must be a trained person like Maharaja Yudhisthira, and he must have the full autocratic
power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a
perfect king like Maharaja Yudhisthira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like
Maharaja Yudhisthira to rule over the world.
