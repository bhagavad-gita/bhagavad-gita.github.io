TRANSLATION
The city of Dvarakapuri was filled with the opulences of all seasons. There were hermitages, orchards,
flower gardens, parks and reservoirs of water breeding lotus flowers all over.
PURPORT
Perfection of human civilization is made possible by utilizing the gifts of nature in their own way. As we
find herewith in the description of its opulence, Dvaraka was surrounded by flower gardens and fruit
orchards along with reservoirs of water and growing lotuses. There is no mention of mills and factories
supported by slaughterhouses, which are the necessary paraphernalia of the modern metropolis. The
propensity to utilize nature's own gifts is still there, even in the heart of modern civilized man. The
leaders of modern civilization select their own residential quarters in a place where there are such
naturally beautiful gardens and reservoirs of water, but they leave the common men to reside in congested
areas without parks and gardens. Herein of course we find a different description of the city of Dvaraka. It
is understood that the whole dhama, or residential quarter, was surrounded by such gardens and parks
with reservoirs of water where lotuses grew. It is understood that all the people depended on nature's gifts
of fruits and flowers without industrial enterprises promoting filthy huts and slums for residential
quarters. Advancement of civilization is estimated not on the growth of mills and factories to deteriorate
the finer instincts of the human being, but on developing the potent spiritual instincts of human beings
and giving them a chance to go back to Godhead. Development of factories and mills is called ugra-karma,
or pungent activities, and such activities deteriorate the finer sentiments of the human being and society
to form a dungeon of demons.
We find herein the mention of pious trees which produce seasonal flowers and fruits. The impious trees
are useless jungles only, and they can only be used to supply fuels. In the modern civilization such
impious trees are planted on the sides of roads. Human energy should be properly utilized in developing
the finer senses for spiritual understanding, in which lies the solution of life. Fruits, flowers, beautiful
gardens, parks and reservoirs of water with ducks and swans playing in the midst of lotus flowers, and
cows giving sufficient milk and butter are essential for developing the finer tissues of the human body. As
against this, the dungeons of mines, factories and workshops develop demoniac propensities in the
working class. The vested interests flourish at the cost of the working class, and consequently there are
severe clashes between them in so many ways. The description of Dvaraka-dhama is the ideal of human
civilization.
