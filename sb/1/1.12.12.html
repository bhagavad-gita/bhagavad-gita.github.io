<h2>Purport</h2>
Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositions, but are factual,
as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam. Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every
minute, just as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. The state laws are grossly observed, but
the laws of material nature, being subtle to our gross understanding, cannot be experienced grossly. As
stated in the Bhagavad-gita (3.9), every action of life produces another reaction, which is binding upon us,
and only those who are acting on behalf of Yajna (Visnu) are not bound by reactions. Our actions are
judged by the higher authorities, the agents of the Lord, and thus we are awarded bodies according to our
activities. The law of nature is so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective stars,
and a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment by the manipulation of
such astronomical influence. A man's destiny is therefore ascertained by the birthtime constellation of
stars, and a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great science, and misuse of a science
does not make it useless. Maharaja Pariksit or even the Personality of Godhead appear in certain
constellations of good stars, and thus the influence is exerted upon the body thus born at an auspicious
moment. The most auspicious constellation of stars takes place during the appearance of the Lord in this
material world, and it is specifically called jayanti, a word not to be abused for any other purposes.
Maharaja Pariksit was not only a great ksatriya emperor, but also a great devotee of the Lord. Thus he
cannot take his birth at any inauspicious moment. As a proper place and time is selected to receive a
respectable personage, so also to receive such a personality as Maharaja Pariksit, who was especially cared
for by the Supreme Lord, a suitable moment is chosen when all good stars assembled together to exert
their influence upon the King. Thus he took his birth just to be known as the great hero of Srimad-
Bhagavatam. This suitable arrangement of astral influences is never a creation of man's will, but is the
arrangement of the superior management of the agency of the Supreme Lord. Of course, the arrangement
is made according to the good or bad deeds of the living being. Herein lies the importance of pious acts
performed by the living being. Only by pious acts can one be allowed to get good wealth, good education
and beautiful features. The samskaras of the school of sanatana-dharma (man's eternal engagement) are
highly suitable for creating an atmosphere for taking advantage of good stellar influences, and therefore
garbhadhana-samskara, or the first seedling purificatory process prescribed for the higher castes, is the
beginning of all pious acts to receive a good pious and intelligent class of men in human society. There
will be peace and prosperity in the world due to good and sane population only; there is hell and
disturbance only because of the unwanted, insane populace addicted to sex indulgence.
