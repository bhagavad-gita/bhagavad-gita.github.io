TRANSLATION
I have lost my three legs and am now standing on one only. Are you lamenting for my state of
existence? Or are you in great anxiety because henceforward the unlawful meat-eaters will exploit you?
Or are you in a sorry plight because the demigods are now bereft of their share of sacrificial offerings
because no sacrifices are being performed at present? Or are you grieving for living beings because of their
sufferings due to famine and drought?
PURPORT
With the progress of the age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the
power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Since Dharma, or the
principles of religion, would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing
on one leg only. When three fourths of the population of the whole world become irreligious, the
situation is converted into hell for the animals. In the age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many
so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. And
thus faithless societies of men will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are
gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
first-class faithful men are the Vaisnavas and the brahmanas, then the ksatriyas, then the vaisyas, then the
sudras, then the mlecchas, the yavanas and at last the candalas. The degradation of the human instinct
begins from the mlecchas, and the candala state of life is the last word in human degradation. All the
above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth.
They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There is no question of birthright or
community. One can acquire the respective qualifications by one's own efforts, and thus the son of a
Vaisnava can become a mleccha, or the son of a candala can become more than a brahmana, all in terms of
their association and intimate relation with the Supreme Lord.
The meat-eaters are generally called mlecchas. But all meat-eaters are not mlecchas. Those who accept
meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not mlecchas, but those who accept meat without restriction
are called mlecchas. Beef is forbidden in the scriptures, and the bulls and cows are offered special
protection by followers of the Vedas. But in this age of Kali, people will exploit the body of the bull and
the cow as they like, and thus they will invite sufferings of various types.
The people of this age will not perform any sacrifice. The mleccha population will care very little for
performances of sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially
engaged in sense enjoyment. In the Bhagavad-gita performance of sacrifices is strongly recommended (Bg.
3.14-16).
The living beings are created by the creator Brahma, and just to maintain the created living being
progressively towards the path back to Godhead, the system of performing sacrifice is also created by him.
The system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetables, and by eating such foodstuff
they get vital power of the body in the shape of blood and semen, and from blood and semen one living
being is able to create other living beings. But the production of grains, grass, etc. becomes possible by
rain, and this rain is made to shower properly by performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices
are directed by the rites of the Vedas, namely Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva. In the Manu-smrti it is
recommended that by offerings of sacrifice on the altar of the fire, the sun-god is pleased. When the sungod
is pleased, he properly collects water from the sea, and thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon
and rains fall. After sufficient rains fall, there is sufficient production of grains for men and all animals,
and thus there is energy in the living being for progressive activity. The mlecchas, however, make plans to
install slaughterhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animals, thinking that they will prosper
by increasing the number of factories and live on animal food without caring for performance of sacrifices
and production of grains. But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass and
vegetables, otherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass for the animals, they require sufficient
rains. Therefore they have to depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-god, Indra and
Candra, and such demigods must be satisfied by performances of sacrifice.
This material world is a sort of prison house, as we have several times mentioned. The demigods are the
servants of the Lord who see to the proper upkeep of the prison house. These demigods want to see that
the rebel living beings, who want to survive faithlessly, are gradually turned towards the supreme power
of the Lord. Therefore, the system of offering sacrifice is recommended in the scriptures.
The materialistic men want to work hard and enjoy fruitive results for sense enjoyment. Thus they are
committing many types of sins at every step of life. Those, however, who are consciously engaged in the
devotional service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue. Their activities are free
from the contamination of the three modes of material nature. For the devotees there is no need for
performance of prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of sacrifice. But
persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices
because that is the only means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by fruitive workers.
Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins. The demigods are pleased when such
sacrifices are performed, just as prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient
subjects. Lord Caitanya, however, has recommended only one yajna, or sacrifice, called the sankirtanayajna,
the chanting of Hare Krsna, in which everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive
workers can derive equal benefit from the performances of sankirtana-yajna.
