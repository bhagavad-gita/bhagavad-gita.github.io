<h2>Translation</h2>
There is no need to live a degraded life and subsist on the charity of those whom you tried to kill by
arson and poisoning. You also insulted one of their wives and usurped their kingdom and wealth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The system of varnasrama religion sets aside a part of one's life completely for the purpose of selfrealization
and attainment of salvation in the human form of life. That is a routine division of life, but
persons like Dhrtarastra, even at their weary ripened age, want to stay home, even in a degraded condition
of accepting charity from enemies. Vidura wanted to point this out and impressed upon him that it was
better to die like his sons than accept such humiliating charity. Five thousand years ago there was one
Dhrtarastra, but at the present moment there are Dhrtarastras in every home. Politicians especially do not
retire from political activities unless they are dragged by the cruel hand of death or killed by some
opposing element. To stick to family life to the end of one's human life is the grossest type of degradation
and there is an absolute need for the Viduras to educate such Dhrtarastras, even at the present moment.
