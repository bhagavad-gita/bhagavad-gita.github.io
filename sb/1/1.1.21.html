asina dirgha-satrena
kathayam saksana hareh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kalim--the age of Kali (iron age of quarrel); agatam--having arrived; ajnaya--knowing this; ksetre--in this
tract of land; asmin--in this; vaisnave--specially meant for the devotee of the Lord; vayam--we; asinah--
seated; dirgha--prolonged; satrena--for performance of sacrifices; kathayam--in the words of; sa-ksanah--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Knowing well that the age of Kali has already begun, we are assembled here in this holy place to hear at
great length the transcendental message of Godhead and in this way perform sacrifice.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This age of Kali is not at all suitable for self-realization as was Satya-yuga, the golden age, or Treta- or
Dvapara-yugas, the silver and copper ages. For self-realization, the people in Satya-yuga, living a lifetime
of a hundred thousand years, were able to perform prolonged meditation. And in Treta-yuga, when the
duration of life was ten thousand years, self-realization was attained by performance of great sacrifice.
And in the Dvapara-yuga, when the duration of life was one thousand years, self-realization was attained
by worship of the Lord. But in the Kali-yuga, the maximum duration of life being one hundred years only
and that combined with various difficulties, the recommended process of self-realization is that of hearing
and chanting of the holy name, fame, and pastimes of the Lord. The sages of Naimisaranya began this
process in a place meant specifically for the devotees of the Lord. They prepared themselves to hear the
pastimes of the Lord over a period of one thousand years. By the example of these sages one should learn
that regular hearing and recitation of the Bhagavatam is the only way for self-realization. Other attempts
are simply a waste of time, for they do not give any tangible results. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
preached this system of Bhagavata-dharma, and He recommended that all those who were born in India
should take the responsibility of broadcasting the messages of Lord Sri Krsna, primarily the message of
Bhagavad-gita. And when one is well established in the teachings of Bhagavad-gita, he can take up the
study of Srimad-Bhagavatam for further enlightenment in self-realization.
