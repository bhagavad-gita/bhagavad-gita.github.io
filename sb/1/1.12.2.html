<h2>Text</h2>
tasya janma maha-buddheh
karmani ca mahatmanah
nidhanam ca yathaivasit
sa pretya gatavan yatha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

ca--also; maha-atmanah--of the great devotee; nidhanam--demise; ca--also; yatha--as it was; eva--of course;
asit--happened; sah--he; pretya--destination after death; gatavan--achieved; yatha--as it were.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
How was the great emperor Pariksit, who was a highly intelligent and great devotee, born in that womb?
How did his death take place, and what did he achieve after his death?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The king of Hastinapura (now Delhi) used to be the emperor of the world, at least till the time of the
son of Emperor Pariksit. Maharaja Pariksit was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother, so he could
certainly be saved from an untimely death due to the ill will of the son of a brahmana. Because the age of
Kali began to act just after the assumption of power by Maharaja Pariksit, the first sign of misgivings was
exhibited in the cursing of such a greatly intelligent and devoted king as Maharaja Pariksit. The king is
the protector of the helpless citizens, and their welfare, peace and prosperity depend on him.
Unfortunately, by the instigation of the fallen age of Kali, an unfortunate brahmana's son was employed to
condemn the innocent Maharaja Pariksit, and so the King had to prepare himself for death within seven
days. Maharaja Pariksit is especially famous as one who is protected by Visnu, and when he was unduly
cursed by a brahmana's son, he could have invoked the mercy of the Lord to save him, but he did not
want to because he was a pure devotee. A pure devotee never asks the Lord for any undue favor. Maharaja
Pariksit knew that the curse of the brahmana's son upon him was unjustified, as everyone else knew, but
he did not want to counteract it because he knew also that the age of Kali had begun and that the first
symptom of the age, namely degradation of the highly talented brahmana community, had also begun. He
did not want to interfere with the current of the time, but he prepared himself to meet death very
cheerfully and very properly. Being fortunate, he got at least seven days to prepare himself to meet death,
and so he properly utilized the time in the association of Sukadeva Gosvami, the great saint and devotee
of the Lord.
