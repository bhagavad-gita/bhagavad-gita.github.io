<h2>Translation</h2>
It is personally experienced by me that those who are always full of cares and anxieties due to desiring
contact of the senses with their objects can cross the ocean of nescience on a most suitable boat--the
constant chanting of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The symptom of a living being is that he cannot remain silent even for some time. He must be doing
something, thinking of something or talking about something. Generally the materialistic men think and
discuss about subjects which satisfy their senses. But as these things are exercised under the influence of
the external, illusory energy, such sensual activities do not actually give them any satisfaction. On the
contrary, they become full with cares and anxieties. This is called maya, or what is not. That which cannot
give them satisfaction is accepted as an object for satisfaction. So Narada Muni, by his personal
experience, says that satisfaction for such frustrated beings engaged in sense gratification is to chant
always the activities of the Lord. The point is that the subject matter only should be changed. No one can
check the thinking activities of a living being, nor the feeling, willing or working processes. But if one
wants actual happiness, one must change the subject matter only. Instead of talking of the politics of a
dying man, one might discuss the politics administered by the Lord Himself. Instead of relishing activities
of the cinema artists, one can turn his attention to the activities of the Lord with His eternal associates like
the gopis and Laksmis. The almighty Personality of Godhead, by His causeless mercy, descends on the
earth and manifests activities almost on the line of the worldly men, but at the same time extraordinarily,
because He is almighty. He does so for the benefit of all conditioned souls so that they can turn their
attention to transcendence. By doing so, the conditioned soul will gradually be promoted to the
transcendental position and easily cross the ocean of nescience, the source of all miseries. This is stated
from personal experience by such an authority as Sri Narada Muni. And we can have the same experience
also if we begin to follow in the footsteps of the great sage, the dearmost devotee of the Lord.
