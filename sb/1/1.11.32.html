<h2>Text</h2>
tam atmajair drstibhir antaratmana
duranta-bhavah parirebhire patim
niruddham apy asravad ambu netrayor
vilajjatinam bhrgu-varya vaiklavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--Him (the Lord); atma-jaih--by the sons; drstibhih--by the sight; antara-atmana--by the innermost
part of the heart; duranta-bhavah--insuperable ecstasy; parirebhire--embraced; patim--husband;
niruddham--choked up; api--in spite of; asravat--tears; ambu--like drops of water; netrayoh--from the
eyes; vilajjatinam--of those situated in shyness; bhrgu-varya--O chief of the Bhrgus; vaiklavat--
inadvertently.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The insuperable ecstasy was so strong that the queens, who were shy, first embraced the Lord in the
innermost recesses of their hearts. Then they embraced Him visually, and then they sent their sons to
embrace Him [which is equal to personal embracing]. But, O chief amongst the Bhrgus, though they tried
to restrain their feelings, they inadvertently shed tears.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although due to feminine shyness there were many hindrances to embracing the dear husband, Lord Sri
Krsna, the queens performed that act by seeing Him, by putting Him in the cores of their hearts, and by
sending their sons to embrace Him. Still, the act remained unfinished, and tears rolled down their cheeks
despite all endeavors to check them. One indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace
him because the son is developed as part of the mother's body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the
embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the
affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation, and thus
according to Srila Jiva Gosvami there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband
and wife.
