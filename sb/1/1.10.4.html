<h2>Translation</h2>
During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the
earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the
cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The basic principle of economic development is centered on land and cows. The necessities of human
society are food grains, fruits, milk, minerals, clothing, wood, etc. One requires all these items to fulfill
the material needs of the body. Certainly one does not require flesh and fish or iron tools and machinery.
During the regime of Maharaja Yudhisthira, all over the world there were regulated rainfalls. Rainfalls are
not in the control of the human being. The heavenly King Indradeva is the controller of rains, and he is
the servant of the Lord. When the Lord is obeyed by the king and the people under the king's
administration, there are regulated rains from the horizon, and these rains are the causes of all varieties of
production on the land. Not only do regulated rains help ample production of grains and fruits, but when
they combine with astronomical influences there is ample production of valuable stones and pearls.
Grains and vegetables can sumptuously feed a man and animals, and a fatty cow delivers enough milk to
supply a man sumptuously with vigor and vitality. If there is enough milk, enough grains, enough fruit,
enough cotton, enough silk and enough jewels, then why do the people need cinemas, houses of
prostitution, slaughterhouses, etc.? What is the need of an artificial luxurious life of cinema, cars, radio,
flesh and hotels? Has this civilization produced anything but quarreling individually and nationally? Has
this civilization enhanced the cause of equality and fraternity by sending thousands of men into a hellish
factory and the war fields at the whims of a particular man?
It is said here that the cows used to moisten the pasturing land with milk because their milk bags were
fatty and the animals were joyful. Do they not require, therefore, proper protection for a joyful life by
being fed with a sufficient quantity of grass in the field? Why should men kill cows for their selfish
purposes? Why should man not be satisfied with grains, fruits and milk, which, combined together, can
produce hundreds and thousands of palatable dishes. Why are there slaughterhouses all over the world to
kill innocent animals? Maharaja Pariksit, grandson of Maharaja Yudhisthira, while touring his vast
kingdom, saw a black man attempting to kill a cow. The King at once arrested the butcher and chastised
him sufficiently. Should not a king or executive head protect the lives of the poor animals who are unable
to defend themselves? Is this humanity? Are not the animals of a country citizens also? Then why are they
allowed to be butchered in organized slaughterhouses? Are these the signs of equality, fraternity and
nonviolence?
Therefore, in contrast with the modern, advanced, civilized form of government, an autocracy like
Maharaja Yudhisthira's is by far superior to a so-called democracy in which animals are killed and a man
less than an animal is allowed to cast votes for another less-than-animal man.
We are all creatures of material nature. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that the Lord Himself is the seedgiving
father and material nature is the mother of all living beings in all shapes. Thus mother material
nature has enough foodstuff both for animals and for men, by the grace of the Father Almighty, Sri Krsna.
The human being is the elder brother of all other living beings. He is endowed with intelligence more
powerful than animals for realizing the course of nature and the indications of the Almighty Father.
Human civilizations should depend on the production of material nature without artificially attempting
economic development to turn the world into a chaos of artificial greed and power only for the purpose of
artificial luxuries and sense gratification. This is but the life of dogs and hogs.
