<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus saved from the radiation of the brahmastra, Kunti, the chaste devotee of the Lord, and her five
sons and Draupadi addressed Lord Krsna as He started for home.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kunti is described herein as sati, or chaste, due to her unalloyed devotion to Lord Sri Krsna. Her mind
will now be expressed in the following prayers for Lord Krsna. A chaste devotee of the Lord does not look
to others, namely any other living being or demigod, even for deliverance from danger. That was all along
the characteristic of the whole family of the Pandavas. They knew nothing except Krsna, and therefore the
Lord was also always ready to help them in all respects and in all circumstances. That is the
transcendental nature of the Lord. He reciprocates the dependence of the devotee. One should not,
therefore, look for help from imperfect living beings or demigods, but one should look for all help from
Lord Krsna, who is competent to save His devotees. Such a chaste devotee also never asks the Lord for
help, but the Lord, out of His own accord, is always anxious to render it.
