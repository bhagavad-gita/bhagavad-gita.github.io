bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead, Krsna; api--also; govindah--one who enlivens the cows and the
senses; brahmanyah--devoted to the devotees of the brahmanas; bhakta-vatsalah--affectionate to the
devotees; kaccit--whether; pure--in Dvaraka Puri; sudharmayam--pious assembly; sukham--happiness;
aste--does enjoy; suhrt-vrtah--surrounded by friends.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Is Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gives pleasure to the cows, the senses and the
brahmanas, who is very affectionate towards His devotees, enjoying the pious assembly at Dvaraka Puri
surrounded by friends?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as bhagavan, govinda, brahmanya and bhakta-vatsala.
He is bhagavan svayam, or the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, full with all opulences, all
power, all knowledge, all beauty, all fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He
is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by
the devotional service of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcendental
pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure
from the senses, but being illusioned by false pleasures of the senses, he becomes servant of the senses.
Therefore, we need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the protector of cows and the
brahminical culture. A society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct
protection of the Lord, just as the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king but under
the protection of a severe agent of the king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical
qualities in human society, at least for a section of the members of society, no human civilization can
prosper at any length. By brahminical culture, the development of the dormant qualities of goodness,
namely truthfulness, equanimity, sense control, forbearance, simplicity, general knowledge,
transcendental knowledge, and firm faith in the Vedic wisdom, one can become a brahmana and thus see
the Lord as He is. And after surpassing the brahminical perfection, one has to become a devotee of the
Lord so that His loving affection in the form of proprietor, master, friend, son and lover can be
transcendentally achieved. The stage of a devotee, which attracts the transcendental affection of the Lord,
does not develop unless one has developed the qualities of a brahmana as above mentioned. The Lord is
inclined to a brahmana of quality and not of false prestige. Those who are less than a brahmana by
qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lord, just as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth
unless there is wood, although there is a relation between wood and the earth. Since the Lord is all-perfect
in Himself, there could not be any question of His welfare, and Maharaja Yudhisthira refrained from
asking this question. He simply inquired about His residential place, Dvaraka Puri, where pious men
assemble. The Lord stays only where pious men assemble and takes pleasure in their glorifying the
Supreme Truth. Maharaja Yudhisthira was anxious to know about the pious men and their pious acts in
the city of Dvaraka.
