<h2>Translation</h2>
While Sri Vyasadeva was following his son, beautiful young damsels who were bathing naked covered
their bodies with cloth, although Sri Vyasadeva himself was not naked. But they had not done so when his
son had passed. The sage inquired about this, and the young ladies replied that his son was purified and
when looking at them made no distinction between male and female. But the sage made such distinctions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita (5.18) it is said that a learned sage looks equally on a learned and gentle brahmana,
a candala (dog-eater), a dog or a cow due to his spiritual vision. Srila Sukadeva Gosvami attained that
stage. Thus he did not see a male or female; he saw all living entities in different dress. The ladies who
were bathing could understand the mind of a man simply by studying his demeanor, just as by looking at
a child one can understand how innocent he is. Sukadeva Gosvami was a young boy sixteen years old, and
therefore all the parts of his body were developed. He was naked also, and so were the ladies. But because
Sukadeva Gosvami was transcendental to sex relations, he appeared very innocent. The ladies, by their
special qualifications, could sense this at once, and therefore they were not very concerned about him. But
when his father passed, the ladies quickly dressed. The ladies were exactly like his children or
grandchildren, yet they reacted to the presence of Vyasadeva according to the social custom because Srila
Vyasadeva played the part of a householder. A householder has to distinguish between a male and female,
otherwise he cannot be a householder. One should, therefore, attempt to know the distinction between
spirit soul without any attachment for male and female. As long as such distinction is there, one should
not try to become a sannyasi like Sukadeva Gosvami. At least theoretically one must be convinced that a
living entity is neither male nor female. The outward dress is made of matter by material nature to attract
the opposite sex and thus keep one entangled in material existence. A liberated soul is above this
perverted distinction. He does not distinguish between one living being and another. For him they are all
one and the same spirit. The perfection of this spiritual vision is the liberated stage, and Srila Sukadeva
Gosvami attained that stage. Srila Vyasadeva was also in the transcendental stage, but because he was in
the householder's life, he did not pretend to be a liberated soul, as a matter of custom.
