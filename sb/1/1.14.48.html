eka atmatmanam sva-drk

SYNONYMS
tat--therefore; idam--this manifestation; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; rajan--O King; ekah--
one without a second; atma--the Supersoul; atmanam--by His energies; sva-drk--qualitatively like Him;
antarah--without; anantarah--within and by Himself; bhati--so manifests; pasya--look; tam--unto Him
only; mayaya--by manifestations of different energies; urudha--appears to be many.
TRANSLATION
Therefore, O King, you should look to the Supreme Lord only, who is one without a second and who
manifests Himself by different energies and is both within and without.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is one without a second, but He manifests Himself by
different energies because He is by nature blissful. The living beings are also manifestations of His
marginal energy, qualitatively one with the Lord, and there are innumerable living beings both within and
without the external and internal energies of the Lord. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the
Lord's internal energy, the living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord
without contamination from the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lord, the living
being, due to contamination of the material world, is pervertedly manifested, and therefore he experiences
so-called happiness and distress in the material world. Such experiences are all ephemeral and do not
affect the spirit soul. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the
forgetfulness of his qualities, which are equal to the Lord's. There is, however, a regular current from the
Lord Himself, from within and without, by which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. From
within He corrects the desiring living beings as localized Paramatma, and from without He corrects by His
manifestations, the spiritual master and the revealed scriptures. One should look unto the Lord; one
should not be disturbed by the so-called manifestations of happiness or distress, but he should try to
cooperate with the Lord in His outward activities for correcting the fallen souls. By His order only, one
should become a spiritual master and cooperate with the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master
for one's personal benefit, for some material gain or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning
livelihood. Bona fide spiritual masters who look unto the Supreme Lord to cooperate with Him are
actually qualitatively one with the Lord, and the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. Yudhisthira
Maharaja is advised by Narada, therefore, not to be disturbed by the affairs of so-called happiness and
distress, but to look only unto the Lord to execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That
was his prime duty.
