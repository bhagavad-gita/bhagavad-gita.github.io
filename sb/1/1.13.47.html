<h2>Text</h2>
ahastani sahastanam
apadani catus-padam
phalguni tatra mahatam
jivo jivasya jivanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ahastani--those who are devoid of hands; sa-hastanam--of those who are endowed with hands; apadani--
those who are devoid of legs; catuh-padam--of those who have four legs; phalguni--those who are weak;
tatra--there; mahatam--of the powerful; jivah--the living being; jivasya--of the living being; jivanam--
subsistence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the
four-legged. The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is
food for another.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A systematic law of subsistence in the struggle for existence is there by the supreme will, and there is no
escape for anyone by any amount of planning. The living beings who have come to the material world
against the will of the Supreme Being are under the control of a supreme power called maya-sakti, the
deputed agent of the Lord, and this daivi maya is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold
miseries, one of which is explained here in this verse: the weak are the subsistence of the strong. No one
is strong enough to protect himself from the onslaught of a stronger, and by the will of the Lord there are
systematic categories of the weak, the stronger and the strongest. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger
eats a weaker animal, including a man, because that is the law of the Supreme Lord. But although the law
states that a human being must subsist on another living being, there is the law of good sense also, for the
human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. This is impossible for other animals. The human
being is meant for self-realization, and for that purpose he is not to eat anything which is not first offered
to the Lord. The Lord accepts from His devotee all kinds of food preparations made of vegetables, fruits,
leaves and grains. Fruits, leaves and milk in different varieties can be offered to the Lord, and after the
Lord accepts the foodstuff, the devotee can partake of the prasada, by which all suffering in the struggle
for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (9.26). Even those who
are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuff, not to the Lord directly, but to an agent of the Lord,
under certain conditions of religious rites. Injunctions of the scriptures are meant not to encourage the
eaters of animals, but to restrict them by regulated principles.
The living being is the source of subsistence for other, stronger living beings. No one should be very
anxious for his subsistence in any circumstances because there are living beings everywhere, and no living
being starves for want of food at any place. Maharaja Yudhisthira is advised by Narada not to worry about
his uncles' suffering for want of food, for they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as prasada
of the Supreme Lord and thus realize the path of salvation.
Exploitation of the weaker living being by the stronger is the natural law of existence; there is always an
attempt to devour the weak in different kingdoms of living beings. There is no possibility of checking this
tendency by any artificial means under material conditions; it can be checked only by awakening the
spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulations. The spiritual regulative principles,
however, do not allow a man to slaughter weaker animals on one side and teach others peaceful
coexistence. If man does not allow the animals peaceful coexistence, how can he expect peaceful existence
in human society? The blind leaders must therefore understand the Supreme Being and then try to
implement the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, or Rama-rajya, is impossible without the
awakening of God consciousness in the mass mind of the people of the world.
