<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka Muni asked: After killing his enemies who desired to usurp his rightful inheritance, how did
the greatest of all religious men, Maharaja Yudhisthira, assisted by his brothers, rule his subjects? Surely
he could not freely enjoy his kingdom with unrestricted consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the greatest of all men of religion. Thus he was not at all inclined to fight with
his cousins for the sake of enjoying the kingdom: he fought for the right cause because the kingdom of
Hastinapura was his rightful inheritance and his cousins wanted to usurp it for themselves. He fought,
therefore, for the right cause under the guidance of Lord Sri Krsna, but he could not enjoy the results of
his victory because his cousins were all killed in the fight. He therefore ruled over the kingdom as a
matter of duty, assisted by his younger brothers. The inquiry was important for Saunaka Rsi, who wanted
to know about the behavior of Maharaja Yudhisthira when he was at ease to enjoy the kingdom.
