<h2>Translation</h2>
The most fortunate Emperor Maharaja Pariksit, who was entrusted with the kingdom of Hastinapura by
Maharaja Yudhisthira when he desired to retire to the forest, is now ruling the world with great success
due to his being glorified by the deeds of the kings of the Kuru dynasty.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimisaranya were begun shortly after
the demise of Maharaja Pariksit. The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand years, and it is
understood that in the beginning some of the contemporaries of Baladeva, the elder brother of Lord
Krsna, also visited the sacrificial place. According to some authorities, the present tense is also used to
indicate the nearest margin of time from the past. In that sense, the present tense is applied to the reign of
Maharaja Pariksit here. For a continuous fact, also, present tense can be used. The principles of Maharaja
Pariksit can be still continued, and human society can still be improved if there is determination by the
authorities. We can still purge out from the state all the activities of immorality introduced by the
personality of Kali if we are determined to take action like Maharaja Pariksit. He allotted some place for
Kali, but in fact Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Maharaja Pariksit was strictly
vigilant to see that there were no places for gambling, drinking, prostitution and animal slaughter.
Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the state, but fools as they are, they do not know
how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houses, wine and other intoxicating drug houses,
brothels, hotel prostitution and cinema houses, and falsity in every dealing, even in their own, and they
want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. They want the kingdom of God without God
consciousness. How can it be possible to adjust two contradictory matters? If we want to drive out
corruption from the state, we must first of all organize society to accept the principles of religion, namely
austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, and to make the condition favorable we must close all
places of gambling, drinking, prostitution and falsity. These are some of the practical lessons from the
pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
