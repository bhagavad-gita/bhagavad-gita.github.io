<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Vyasadeva, in that association and by the mercy of those great Vedantists, I could hear them describe
the attractive activities of Lord Krsna And thus listening attentively, my taste for hearing of the
Personality of Godhead increased at every step.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, is attractive not only in His personal features, but
also in His transcendental activities. It is so because the Absolute is absolute by His name, fame, form,
pastimes, entourage, paraphernalia, etc. The Lord descends on this material world out of His causeless
mercy and displays His various transcendental pastimes as a human being so that human beings attracted
towards Him become able to go back to Godhead. Men are naturally apt to hear histories and narrations of
various personalities performing mundane activities, without knowing that by such association one
simply wastes valuable time and also becomes addicted to the three qualities of mundane nature. Instead
of wasting time, one can get spiritual success by turning his attention to the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord. By hearing the narration of the pastimes of the Lord, one contacts directly the Personality of
Godhead, and, as explained before, by hearing about the Personality of Godhead, from within, all
accumulated sins of the mundane creature are cleared. Thus being cleared of all sins, the hearer gradually
becomes liberated from mundane association and becomes attracted to the features of the Lord. Narada
Muni has just explained this by his personal experience. The whole idea is that simply by hearing about
the Lord's pastimes one can become one of the associates of the Lord. Narada Muni has eternal life,
unlimited knowledge and unfathomed bliss, and he can travel all over the material and spiritual worlds
without restriction. One can attain to the highest perfection of life simply by attentive hearing of the
transcendental pastimes of the Lord from the right sources, as Sri Narada heard them from the pure
devotees (bhakti-vedantas) in his previous life. This process of hearing in the association of the devotees
is especially recommended in this age of quarrel (Kali).
