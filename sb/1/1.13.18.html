<h2>Translation</h2>
Mahatma Vidura knew all this, and therefore he addressed Dhrtarastra, saying: My dear King, please get
out of here immediately. Do not delay. Just see how fear has overtaken you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Cruel death cares for no one, be he Dhrtarastra or even Maharaja Yudhisthira; therefore spiritual
instruction, as was given to old Dhrtarastra, was equally applicable to younger Maharaja Yudhisthira. As a
matter of fact, everyone in the royal palace, including the King and his brothers and mother, was raptly
attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for
Dhrtarastra, who was too materialistic. The word rajan is especially addressed to Dhrtarastra significantly.
Dhrtarastra was the eldest son of his father, and therefore according to law he was to be installed on the
throne of Hastinapura. But because he was blind from birth, he was disqualified from his rightful claim.
But he could not forget the bereavement, and his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the
death of Pandu, his younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor children, and
Dhrtarastra became the natural guardian of them, but at heart he wanted to become the factual king and
hand the kingdom over to his own sons, headed by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitions,
Dhrtarastra wanted to become a king, and he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his
brother-in-law Sakuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lord, and at the last stage, even after losing
everything, men and money, he wanted to remain as king, being the eldest uncle of Maharaja Yudhisthira.
Maharaja Yudhisthira, as a matter of duty, maintained Dhrtarastra in royal honor, and Dhrtarastra was
happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King
Yudhisthira. Vidura, as a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhrtarastra, wanted
to awaken Dhrtarastra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed
Dhrtarastra as the "King," which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal time, and
therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated
English king wanted to order time and tide, but the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one
is a false king in the material world, and Dhrtarastra was particularly reminded of this false position and
of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get
out immediately, if he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He
did not ask Maharaja Yudhisthira in that way because he knew that a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira is
aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himself, in due course, even
though Vidura might not be present at that time.
