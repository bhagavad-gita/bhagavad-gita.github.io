<h2>Text</h2>
aho mahiyasi jantor
jivitasa yatha bhavan
bhimapavarjitam pindam
adatte grha-palavat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--alas; mahiyasi--powerful; jantoh--of the living beings; jivita-asa--hope for life; yatha--as much as;
bhavan--you are; bhima--of Bhimasena (a brother of Yudhisthira's); apavarjitam--remnants; pindam--
foodstuff; adatte--eaten by; grha-pala-vat--like a household dog.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Alas, how powerful are the hopes of a living being to continue his life. Verily, you are living just like a
household dog and are eating remnants of food given by Bhima.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A sadhu should never flatter kings or rich men to live comfortably at their cost. A sadhu is to speak to
the householders about the naked truth of life so that they may come to their senses about the precarious
life in material existence. Dhrtarastra is a typical example of an attached old man in household life. He
had become a pauper in the true sense, yet he wanted to live comfortably in the house of the Pandavas, of
whom Bhima especially is mentioned because personally he killed two prominent sons of Dhrtarastra,
namely Duryodhana and Duhsasana. These two sons were very much dear to him for their notorious and
nefarious activities, and Bhima is particularly pointed out because he killed these two pet sons. Why was
Dhrtarastra living there at the house of the Pandavas? Because he wanted to continue his life comfortably,
even at the risk of all humiliation. Vidura, therefore, was astonished how powerful is the urge to continue
life. This sense of continuing one's life indicates that a living being is eternally a living entity and does not
want to change his bodily habitation. The foolish man does not know that a particular term of bodily
existence is awarded to him to undergo a term of imprisonment, and the human body is awarded, after
many, many births and deaths, as a chance for self-realization to go back home, back to Godhead. But
persons like Dhrtarastra try to make plans to live there in a comfortable position with profit and interest,
for they do not see things as they are. Dhrtarastra is blind and continues to hope to live comfortably in the
midst of all kinds of reverses of life. A sadhu like Vidura is meant to awaken such blind persons and thus
help them go back to Godhead, where life is eternal. Once going there, no one wants to come back to this
material world of miseries. We can just imagine how responsible a task is entrusted to a sadhu like
Mahatma Vidura.
