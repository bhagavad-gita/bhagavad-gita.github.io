<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pariksit married the daughter of King Uttara and begot four sons, headed by Maharaja Janamejaya.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Uttara was the son of Virata and maternal uncle of Maharaja Pariksit. Iravati, being the
daughter of Maharaja Uttara, was the cousin-sister of Maharaja Pariksit, but cousin-brothers and -sisters
were allowed to get married if they did not belong to the same gotra, or family. In the Vedic system of
marriage, the importance of the gotra, or family, was stressed. Arjuna also married Subhadra, although she
was his maternal cousin-sister.
Janamejaya: One of the rajarsi kings and the famous son of Maharaja Pariksit. His mother's name was
Iravati, or according to some, Madravati. Maharaja Janamejaya begot two sons of the names Jnatanika and
Sankukarna. He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kuruksetra pilgrimage site, and he had three younger
brothers named Srutasena, Ugrasena and Bhimasena II. He invaded Taksala (Ajanta), and he decided to
avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Maharaja Pariksit. He performed a great sacrifice called
Sarpa-yajna, to kill the race of serpents, including the taksaka, which had bitten his father to death. On
request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of
snakes, but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding
them properly. In the ceremony, Mahamuni Vyasadeva also was present, and he personally narrated the
history of the Battle of Kuruksetra before the King. Later on by the order of Vyasadeva, his disciple
Vaisampayana narrated before the King the subject matter of Mahabharata. He was much affected by his
great father's untimely death and was very anxious to see him again, and he expressed his desire before
the great sage Vyasadeva. Vyasadeva also fulfilled his desire. His father was present before him, and he
worshiped both his father and Vyasadeva with great respect and pomp. Being fully satisfied, he most
munificently gave charities to the brahmanas present at the sacrifice.
