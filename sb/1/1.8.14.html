<h2>Text</h2>
antahsthah sarva-bhutanam
atma yogesvaro harih
sva-mayayavrnod garbham
vairatyah kuru-tantave
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
antahsthah--being within; sarva--all; bhutanam--of the living beings; atma--soul; yoga-isvarah--the Lord
of all mysticism; harih--the Supreme Lord; sva-mayaya--by the personal energy; avrnot--covered;
garbham--embryo; vairatyah--of Uttara; kuru-tantave--for the progeny of Maharaja Kuru.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord of supreme mysticism, Sri Krsna, resides within everyone's heart as the Paramatma. As such,
just to protect the progeny of the Kuru dynasty, He covered the embryo of Uttara by His personal energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord of supreme mysticism can simultaneously reside within everyone's heart, or even within the
atoms, by His Paramatma feature, His plenary portion. Therefore, from within the body of Uttara He
covered the embryo to save Maharaja Pariksit and protect the progeny of Maharaja Kuru, of whom King
Pandu was also a descendant. Both the sons of Dhrtarastra and those of Pandu belonged to the same
dynasty of Maharaja Kuru; therefore both of them were generally known as Kurus. But when there were
differences between the two families, the sons of Dhrtarastra were known as Kurus whereas the sons of
Pandu were known as Pandavas. Since the sons and grandsons of Dhrtarastra were all killed in the Battle
of Kuruksetra, the last son of the dynasty is designated as the son of the Kurus.
