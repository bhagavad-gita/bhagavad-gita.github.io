<h2>Text</h2>
tasya karmany udarani
parigitani suribhih
bruhi nah sraddadhananam
lilaya dadhatah kalah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--His; karmani--transcendental acts; udarani--magnanimous; parigitani--broadcast; suribhih--by the
great souls; bruhi--please speak; nah--unto us; sraddadhananam--ready to receive with respect; lilaya--
pastimes; dadhatah--advented; kalah--incarnations.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
His transcendental acts are magnificent and gracious, and great learned sages like Narada sing of them.
Please, therefore, speak to us, who are eager to hear about the adventures He performs in His various
incarnations.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Personality of Godhead is never inactive as some less intelligent persons suggest. His works are
magnificent and magnanimous. His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all
variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as Srila Narada, Vyasa, Valmiki, Devala,
Asita, Madhva, Sri Caitanya, Ramanuja, Visnusvami, Nimbarka, Sridhara, Visvanatha, Baladeva,
Bhaktivinoda, Siddhanta Sarasvati and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creations, both
material and spiritual, are full of opulence, beauty and knowledge, but the spiritual realm is more
magnificent due to its being full of knowledge, bliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested
for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract
people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information
of the reality, and they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more
intelligent men guided by sages like Vyasa and Narada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more
delightful, larger, and eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the
activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures
as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By
such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are
engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the
spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as karmis, or fruitive workers, and jnanis, or dry
mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as satvata, or the
devotee, who is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged
in the positive service of the Lord, and thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the
karmis and jnanis.
As the supreme controller of both the material and spiritual worlds, the Lord has different incarnations
of unlimited categories. Incarnations like Brahma, Rudra, Manu, Prthu and Vyasa are His material
qualitative incarnations, but His incarnations like Rama, Narasimha, Varaha and Vamana are His
transcendental incarnations. Lord Sri Krsna is the fountainhead of all incarnations, and He is therefore the
cause of all causes.
