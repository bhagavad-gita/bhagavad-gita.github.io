<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit, after having selected Krpacarya for guidance as his spiritual master, performed three
horse sacrifices on the banks of the Ganges. These were executed with sufficient rewards for the
attendants. And at these sacrifices, even the common man could see demigods.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. In many
statements in Bhagavatam, we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to
attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of
the horse sacrifice ceremony of Maharaja Pariksit, the demigods from other planets were visible even to
the common man, due to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to common
men, as the Lord is not visible. But as the Lord, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the
common man, similarly the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace.
Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth, it was due to the
influence of Maharaja Pariksit that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend
lavishly during such sacrifices, as a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another form of water,
or, in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. Similarly, the charity made by the kings
in such sacrifices are but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. But, as the rains fall down
very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more
than what the citizen needs. Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king, and thus
there was no need in changing the monarchial state.
Even for a king like Maharaja Pariksit there was need of a spiritual master for guidance. Without such
guidance one cannot make progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master must be bona fide, and one who
wants to have self-realization must approach and take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master to achieve
real success.
