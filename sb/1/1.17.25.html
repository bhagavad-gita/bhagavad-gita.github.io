<h2>Text</h2>
idanim dharma padas te
satyam nirvartayed yatah
tam jighrksaty adharmo 'yam
anrtenaidhitah kalih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
idanim--at the present moment; dharma--O personality of religion; padah--leg; te--of you; satyam--
truthfulness; nirvartayet--hobbling along somehow or other; yatah--whereby; tam--that; jighrksati--trying
to destroy; adharmah--the personality of irreligion; ayam--this; anrtena--by deceit; edhitah--flourishing;
kalih--quarrel personified.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
You are now standing on one leg only, which is your truthfulness, and you are somehow or other
hobbling along. But quarrel personified [Kali], flourishing by deceit, is also trying to destroy that leg.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or man-made formulas, but they stand on four
primary regulative observances, namely austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness. The mass of people
must be taught to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means to accept voluntarily things
which may not be very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realization, for example,
fasting. Fasting twice or four times a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily accepted for
spiritual realization only, and not for any other purposes, political or otherwise. Fastings which are meant
not for self-realization but for some other purposes are condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (17.5-6).
Similarly, cleanliness is necessary both for the mind and for the body. Simply bodily cleanliness may help
to some extent, but cleanliness of the mind is necessary, and it is effected by glorifying the Supreme Lord.
No one can cleanse the accumulated mental dust without glorifying the Supreme Lord. A godless
civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it has no idea of God, and for this simple reason people
under such a civilization cannot have good qualifications, however they may be materially equipped. We
have to see things by their resultant action. The resultant action of human civilization in the age of Kali is
dissatisfaction, so everyone is anxious to get peace of mind. This peace of mind was complete in the Satya
age because of the existence of the above-mentioned attributes of the human beings. Gradually these
attributes have diminished in the Treta-yuga to three fourths, in the Dvapara to half, and in this age of
Kali to one fourth, which is also gradually diminishing on account of prevailing untruthfulness. By pride,
either artificial or real, the resultant action of austerity is spoiled; by too much affection for female
association, cleanliness is spoiled; by too much addiction to intoxication, mercy is spoiled; and by too
much lying propaganda, truthfulness is spoiled. The revival of bhagavata-dharma can save human
civilization from falling prey to evils of all description.
