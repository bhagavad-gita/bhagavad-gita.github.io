O great souls.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The good King [Yudhisthira] inquired: O great souls, will he become as saintly a king, as pious in his
very name and as famous and glorified in his achievements, as others who appeared in this great royal
family?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The forefathers of King Yudhisthira were all great saintly kings, pious and glorified by their great
achievements. They were all saints on the royal throne. And therefore all the members of the state were
happy, pious, well behaved, prosperous and spiritually enlightened. Under strict guidance of the great
souls and spiritual injunctions, such great saintly kings were trained up, and as a result the kingdom was
full of saintly persons and was a happy land of spiritual life. Maharaja Yudhisthira was himself a replica of
his ancestors, and he desired that the next king after him become exactly like his great forefathers. He was
happy to learn from the learned brahmanas that by astrological calculations the child would be born a
first-grade devotee of the Lord, and more confidentially he wanted to know whether the child was going
to follow in the footsteps of his great forefathers. That is the way of the monarchical state. The reigning
king should be a pious, chivalrous devotee of the Lord and fear personified for the upstarts. He must also
leave an heir apparent equally qualified to rule over the innocent citizens. In the modern setup of the
democratic states, the people themselves are fallen to the qualities of the sudras or less, and the
government is run by their representative, who is ignorant of the scriptural mode of administrative
education. Thus the whole atmosphere is surcharged with sudra qualities, manifested by lust and avarice.
Such administrators quarrel every day among themselves. The cabinet of ministers changes often due to
party and group selfishness. Everyone wants to exploit the state resources till he dies. No one retires from
political life unless forced to do so. How can such low-grade men do good to the people? The result is
corruption, intrigue and hypocrisy. They should learn from the Srimad-Bhagavatam how ideal the
administrators must be before they can be given charge of different posts.
