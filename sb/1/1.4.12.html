<h2>Text</h2>
sivaya lokasya bhavaya bhutaye
ya uttama-sloka-parayana janah
jivanti natmartham asau parasrayam
mumoca nirvidya kutah kalevaram
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sivaya--welfare; lokasya--of all living beings; bhavaya--for flourishing; bhutaye--for economic
development; ye--one who is; uttama-sloka-parayanah--devoted to the cause of the Personality of
Godhead; janah--men; jivanti--do live; na--but not; atma-artham--selfish interest; asau--that; paraasrayam--
shelter for others; mumoca--gave up; nirvidya--being freed from all attachment; kutah--for what
reason; kalevaram--mortal body.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Those who are devoted to the cause of the Personality of Godhead live only for the welfare,
development and happiness of others. They do not live for any selfish interest. So even though the
Emperor [Pariksit] was free from all attachment to worldly possessions, how could he give up his mortal
body, which was shelter for others?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Pariksit Maharaja was an ideal king and householder because he was a devotee of the Personality of
Godhead. A devotee of the Lord automatically has all good qualifications. And the Emperor was a typical
example of this. Personally he had no attachment for all the worldly opulences in his possession. But since
he was king for the all-around welfare of his citizens, he was always busy in the welfare work of the
public, not only for this life, but also for the next. He would not allow slaughterhouses or killing of cows.
He was not a foolish and partial administrator who would arrange for the protection of one living being
and allow another to be killed. Because he was a devotee of the Lord, he knew perfectly well how to
conduct his administration for everyone's happiness--men, animals, plants and all living creatures. He was
not selfishly interested. Selfishness is either self-centered or self-extended. He was neither. His interest
was to please the Supreme Truth, Personality of Godhead. The king is the representative of the Supreme
Lord, and therefore the king's interest must be identical with that of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord
wants all living beings to be obedient to Him and thereby become happy. Therefore the king's interest is
to guide all subjects back to the kingdom of God. Hence the activities of the citizens should be so
coordinated that they can at the end go back home, back to Godhead. Under the administration of a
representative king, the kingdom is full of opulence. At that time, human beings need not eat animals.
There are ample food grains, milk, fruit and vegetables so that the human beings as well as the animals
can eat sumptuously and to their heart's content. If all living beings are satisfied with food and shelter and
obey the prescribed rules, there cannot be any disturbance between one living being and another.
Emperor Pariksit was a worthy king, and therefore all were happy during his reign.
