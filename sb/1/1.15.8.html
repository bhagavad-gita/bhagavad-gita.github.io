TRANSLATION
Is He going to quit His earthly pastimes, as Devarsi Narada indicated? Has that time already arrived?
PURPORT
As we have discussed many times, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna has many
plenary expansions, and each and every one of them, although equally powerful, executes different
functions. In Bhagavad-gita there are different statements by the Lord, and each of these statements is
meant for different plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions. For example, Sri Krsna, the Lord,
says in Bhagavad-gita:
"Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a
predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself." (Bg. 4.7)
"To deliver the faithful, to annihilate the miscreants and also to reestablish the principles of
occupational duty, I appear in every age." (Bg. 4.8)
"If I should cease to work, then all humanity would be misdirected. I would also be the cause of creating
unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings." (Bg. 3.24)
"Whatever action a great man performs, common men will follow. And whatever standards he sets by
exemplary acts, all the world pursues." (Bg. 3.21)
All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lord, namely His
expansions such as Sankarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Narayana. These are all He
Himself in different transcendental expansions, and still the Lord as Sri Krsna functions in a different
sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees. And yet Lord Krsna as He is appears
once every twenty-four hours of Brahma's time (or after a lapse of 8,640,000,000 solar years) in each and
every universe, and all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine
spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord Krsna, Lord Vasudeva, etc., are complex problems
for the layman. There is no difference between the Lord's Self and the Lord's transcendental body. The
expansions execute differential activities. When the Lord, however, appears in His person as Lord Sri
Krsna, His other plenary portions also join in Him by His inconceivable potency called yogamaya, and
thus the Lord Krsna of Vrndavana is different from the Lord Krsna of Mathura or the Lord Krsna of
Dvaraka. The virat-rupa of Lord Krsna is also different from Him, by His inconceivable potency. The viratrupa
exhibited on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra is the material conception of His form. Therefore it should
be understood that when Lord Krsna was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the hunter, the Lord
left His so-called material body in the material world. The Lord is kaivalya, and for Him there is no
difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from Him. Therefore His quitting one
sort of body or accepting another body does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such
activities are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When Maharaja Yudhisthira
was lamenting the possibility of His disappearance, it was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the
disappearance of a great friend, but factually the Lord never quits His transcendental body, as is
misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons have been condemned by the Lord
Himself in Bhagavad-gita, and they are known as the mudhas. That the Lord left His body means that He
left again His plenary portions in the respective dhamas (transcendental abodes), as He left His virat-rupa
in the material world.
