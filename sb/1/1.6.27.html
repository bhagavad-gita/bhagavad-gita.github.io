TRANSLATION
O great sage, as soon as I got a taste for the Personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord
was unflinching. And as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had
accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental.
PURPORT
Ignorance in material existence is compared to darkness, and in all Vedic literatures the Personality of
Godhead is compared to the sun. Wherever there is light there cannot be darkness. Hearing of the Lord's
pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord because there is no difference between the Lord
and His transcendental pastimes. To become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all
ignorance. By ignorance only, the conditioned soul wrongly thinks that both he and the Lord are products
of material nature. But in fact the Personality of Godhead and the living beings are transcendental, and
they have nothing to do with the material nature. When ignorance is removed and it is perfectly realized
that there is nothing existing without the Personality of Godhead, then nescience is removed. Since the
gross and subtle bodies are emanations from the Personality of Godhead, the knowledge of light permits
one to engage both of them in the service of the Lord. The gross body should be engaged in acts of
rendering service to the Lord (as in bringing water, cleansing the temple or making obeisances, etc.). The
path of arcana, or worshiping the Lord in the temple, involves engaging one's gross body in the service of
the Lord. Similarly, the subtle mind should be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord, thinking about them, chanting His name, etc. All such activities are transcendental. None of the
gross or subtle senses should otherwise be engaged. Such realization of transcendental activities is made
possible by many, many years of apprenticeship in the devotional service, but simply attraction of love for
the Personality of Godhead, as it was developed in Narada Muni, by hearing, is highly effective.
