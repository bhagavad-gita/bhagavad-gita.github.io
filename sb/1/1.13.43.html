<h2>Text</h2>
yatha kridopaskaranam
samyoga-vigamav iha
icchaya kridituh syatam
tathaivesecchaya nrnam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as much as; krida-upaskaranam--playthings; samyoga--union; vigamau--disunion; iha--in this
world; icchaya--by the will of; kridituh--just to play a part; syatam--takes place; tatha--so also; eva--
certainly; isa--the Supreme Lord; icchaya--by the will of; nrnam--of the human beings.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As a player sets up and disperses his playthings according to his own sweet will, so the supreme will of
the Lord brings men together and separates them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We must know for certain that the particular position in which we are now set up is an arrangement of
the supreme will in terms of our own acts in the past. The Supreme Lord is present as the localized
Paramatma in the heart of every living being, as it is said in the Bhagavad-gita (13.23), and therefore he
knows everything of our activities in every stage of our lives. He rewards the reactions of our actions by
placing us in some particular place. A rich man gets his son born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but the
child who came as the rich man's son deserved such a place, and therefore he is placed there by the will of
the Lord. And at a particular moment when the child has to be removed from that place, he is also carried
by the will of the Supreme, even if the child or the father does not wish to be separated from the happy
relation. The same thing happens in the case of a poor man also. Neither rich man nor poor man has any
control over such meetings or separations of living beings. The example of a player and his playthings
should not be misunderstood. One may argue that since the Lord is bound to award the reactionary
results of our own actions, the example of a player cannot be applied. But it is not so. We must always
remember that the Lord is the supreme will, and He is not bound by any law. Generally the law of karma
is that one is awarded the result of one's own actions, but in special cases, by the will of the Lord, such
resultant actions are changed also. But this change can be affected by the will of the Lord only, and no
other. Therefore, the example of the player cited in this verse is quite appropriate, for the Supreme Will is
absolutely free to do whatever He likes, and because He is all-perfect, there is no mistake in any of His
actions or reactions. These changes of resultant actions are especially rendered by the Lord when a pure
devotee is involved. It is assured in the Bhagavad-gita (9.30-31) that the Lord saves a pure devotee who
has surrendered unto Him without reservation from all sorts of reactions of sins, and there is no doubt
about this. There are hundreds of examples of reactions changed by the Lord in the history of the world.
If the Lord is able to change the reactions of one's past deeds, then certainly He is not Himself bound by
any action or reaction of His own deeds. He is perfect and transcendental to all laws.
