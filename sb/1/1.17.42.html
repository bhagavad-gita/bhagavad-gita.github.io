<h2>Text</h2>
vrsasya nastams trin padan
tapah saucam dayam iti
pratisandadha asvasya
mahim ca samavardhayat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vrsasya--of the bull (the personality of religion); nastan--lost; trin--three; padan--legs; tapah--austerity;
saucam--cleanliness; dayam--mercy; iti--thus; pratisandadhe--reestablished; asvasya--by encouraging
activities; mahim--the earth; ca--and; samavardhayat--perfectly improved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter the King reestablished the lost legs of the personality of religion [the bull], and by
encouraging activities he sufficiently improved the condition of the earth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By designating particular places for the personality of Kali, Maharaja Pariksit practically cheated Kali. In
the presence of Kali, Dharma (in the shape of a bull), and the earth (in the shape of a cow), he could
actually estimate the general condition of his kingdom, and therefore he at once took proper steps to
reestablish the legs of the bull, namely austerity, cleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the
people of the world, he saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization. Gold is certainly a
generator of falsity, intoxication, prostitution, enmity and violence, but under the guidance of a proper
king or public leader, or a brahmana or sannyasi, the same gold can be properly utilized to reestablish the
lost legs of the bull, the personality of religion.
Maharaja Pariksit, therefore, like his grandfather Arjuna, collected all illicit gold kept for the
propensities of Kali and employed it in the sankirtana-yajna, as per instruction of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
As we have suggested before, one's accumulated wealth may be divided into three parts for distribution,
namely fifty percent for the service of the Lord, twenty-five percent for the family members and twentyfive
percent for personal necessities. Spending fifty percent for the service of the Lord or for propagation
of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the sankirtana-yajna is the maximum display of human mercy.
people of the world are generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledge, especially in regard to the
devotional service of the Lord, and therefore to propagate the systematic transcendental knowledge of
devotional service is the greatest mercy that one can show in this world. When everyone is taught to
sacrifice fifty percent of his accumulated gold for the Lord's service, certainly austerity, cleanliness and
mercy automatically ensue, and thus the lost three legs of the personality of religion are automatically
established. When there is sufficient austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness, naturally mother earth
is completely satisfied, and there is very little chance for Kali to infiltrate the structure of human society.
