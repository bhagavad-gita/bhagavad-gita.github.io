<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta said: In the beginning of the creation, the Lord first expanded Himself in the universal form of the
purusa incarnation and manifested all the ingredients for the material creation. And thus at first there was
the creation of the sixteen principles of material action. This was for the purpose of creating the material
universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Bhagavad-gita states that the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna maintains these material universes
by extending His plenary expansions. So this purusa form is the confirmation of the same principle. The
original Personality of Godhead Vasudeva, or Lord Krsna, who is famous as the son of King Vasudeva or
King Nanda, is full with all opulences, all potencies, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all
renunciation. Part of His opulences are manifested as impersonal Brahman, and part of His opulences are
manifested as Paramatma. This purusa feature of the same Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna is the original
Paramatma manifestation of the Lord. There are three purusa features in the material creation, and this
form, who is known as the Karanodakasayi Visnu, is the first of the three. The others are known as the
Garbhodakasayi Visnu and the Ksirodakasayi Visnu, which we shall know one after another. The
innumerable universes are generated from the skin holes of this Karanodakasayi Visnu, and in each one of
the universes the Lord enters as Garbhodakasayi Visnu.
In the Bhagavad-gita it is also mentioned that the material world is created at certain intervals and then
again destroyed. This creation and destruction is done by the supreme will because of the conditioned
souls, or the nitya-baddha living beings. The nitya-baddha, or the eternally conditioned souls, have the
sense of individuality or ahankara, which dictates them sense enjoyment, which they are unable to have
constitutionally. The Lord is the only enjoyer, and all others are enjoyed. The living beings are
predominated enjoyers. But the eternally conditioned souls, forgetful of this constitutional position, have
strong aspirations to enjoy. The chance to enjoy matter is given to the conditioned souls in the material
world, and side by side they are given the chance to understand their real constitutional position. Those
fortunate living entities who catch the truth and surrender unto the lotus feet of Vasudeva after many,
many births in the material world join the eternally liberated souls and thus are allowed to enter into the
kingdom of Godhead. After this, such fortunate living entities need not come again within the occasional
material creation. But those who cannot catch the constitutional truth are again merged into the mahattattva
at the time of the annihilation of the material creation. When the creation is again set up, this
mahat-tattva is again let loose. This mahat-tattva contains all the ingredients of the material
manifestations, including the conditioned souls. Primarily this mahat-tattva is divided into sixteen parts,
namely the five gross material elements and the eleven working instruments or senses. It is like the cloud
in the clear sky. In the spiritual sky, the effulgence of Brahman is spread all around, and the whole system
is dazzling in spiritual light. The mahat-tattva is assembled in some corner of the vast, unlimited spiritual
sky, and the part which is thus covered by the mahat-tattva is called the material sky. This part of the
spiritual sky, called the mahat-tattva, is only an insignificant portion of the whole spiritual sky, and
within this mahat-tattva there are innumerable universes. All these universes are collectively produced by
the Karanodakasayi Visnu, called also the Maha-Visnu, who simply throws His glance to impregnate the
material sky.
