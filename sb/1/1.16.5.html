<h2>Text</h2>
saunaka uvaca
kasya hetor nijagraha
kalim digvijaye nrpah
nrdeva-cihna-dhrk sudrako
'sau gam yah padahanat
tat kathyatam maha-bhaga
yadi krsna-kathasrayam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
saunakah uvaca--Saunaka Rsi said; kasya--for what; hetoh--reason; nijagraha--sufficiently punished;
kalim--the master of the age of Kali; digvijaye--during the time of his world tour; nrpah--the King; nrdeva--
royal person; cihna-dhrk--decorated like; sudrakah--lowest of the sudras; asau--he; gam--cow; yah--
one who; pada ahanat--struck on the leg; tat--all that; kathyatam--please describe; maha-bhaga--O greatly
fortunate one; yadi--if, however; krsna--about Krsna; katha-asrayam--related with His topics.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka Rsi inquired: Why did Maharaja Pariksit simply punish him, since he was the lowest of the
sudras, having dressed as a king and having struck a cow on the leg? Please describe all these incidents if
they relate to the topics of Lord Krsna.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Saunaka and the rsis were astonished to hear that the pious Maharaja Pariksit simply punished the
culprit and did not kill him. This suggests that a pious king like Maharaja Pariksit should have at once
killed an offender who wanted to cheat the public by dressing like a king and at the same time daring to
insult the purest of the animals, a cow. The rsis in those days, however, could not even imagine that in the
advanced days of the age of Kali the lowest of the sudras will be elected as administrators and will open
organized slaughterhouses for killing cows. Anyway, although hearing about a sudraka who was a cheat
and insulter of a cow was not very interesting to the great rsis, they nevertheless wanted to hear about it
to see if the event had any connection with Lord Krsna. They were simply interested in the topics of Lord
Krsna, for anything that is dovetailed with the narration of Krsna is worth hearing. There are many topics
in the Bhagavatam about sociology, politics, economics, cultural affairs, etc., but all of them are in relation
with Krsna, and therefore all of them are worth hearing. Krsna is the purifying ingredient in all matters,
regardless of what they are. In the mundane world, everything is impure due to its being a product of the
three mundane qualities. The purifying agent, however, is Krsna.
