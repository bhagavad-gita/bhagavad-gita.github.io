TRANSLATION
Sri Suta Gosvami said: Emperor Yudhisthira administered generously to everyone during his reign. He
was exactly like his father. He had no personal ambition and was freed from all sorts of sense gratification
because of his continuous service unto the lotus feet of the Lord Sri Krsna.
PURPORT
As mentioned in our introduction, "There is a need for the science of Krsna in human society for all the
suffering humanity of the world, and we simply request the leading personalities of all nations to take to
the science of Krsna for their own good, for the good of society, and for the good of all the people of the
world." So it is confirmed herein by the example of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the personality of goodness. In
India the people hanker after Rama-rajya because the Personality of Godhead was the ideal king and all
other kings or emperors in India controlled the destiny of the world for the prosperity of every living
being who took birth on the earth. Herein the word prajah is significant. The etymological import of the
word is "that which is born." On the earth there are many species of life, from the aquatics up to the
perfect human beings, and all are known as prajas. Lord Brahma, the creator of this particular universe, is
known as the prajapati because he is the grandfather of all who have taken birth. Thus praja is used in a
broader sense than it is now used. The king represents all living beings, the aquatics, plants, trees,
reptiles, birds, animals and man. Every one of them is a part and parcel of the Supreme Lord (Bg. 14.4),
and the king, being the representative of the Supreme Lord, is duty-bound to give proper protection to
every one of them. This is not the case with the presidents and dictators of this demoralized system of
administration, where the lower animals are given no protection while the higher animals are given socalled
protection. But this is a great science which can be learned only by one who knows the science of
Krsna. By knowing the science of Krsna, one can become the most perfect man in the world, and unless
one has knowledge in this science, all qualifications and doctorate diplomas acquired by academic
education are spoiled and useless. Maharaja Yudhisthira knew this science of Krsna very well, for it is
stated here that by continuous cultivation of this science, or by continuous devotional service to Lord
Krsna, he acquired the qualification of administering the state. The father is sometimes seemingly cruel to
the son, but that does not mean that the father has lost the qualification to be a father. A father is always a
father because he always has the good of the son at heart. The father wants every one of his sons to
become a better man than himself. Therefore, a king like Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was the personality
of goodness, wanted everyone under his administration, especially human beings who have better
developed consciousness, to become devotees of Lord Krsna so that everyone can become free from the
trifles of material existence. His motto of administration was all good for the citizens, for as personified
goodness he knew perfectly well what is actually good for them. He conducted the administration on that
principle, and not on the raksasi, demonic, principle of sense gratification. As an ideal king, he had no
personal ambition, and there was no place for sense gratification because all his senses at all times were
engaged in the loving service of the Supreme Lord, which includes the partial service to the living beings,
who form the parts and parcels of the complete whole. Those who are busy rendering service to the parts
and parcels, leaving aside the whole, only spoil time and energy, as one does when watering the leaves of
a tree without watering the root. If water is poured on the root, the leaves are enlivened perfectly and
automatically, but if water is poured on the leaves only, the whole energy is spoiled. Maharaja
Yudhisthira, therefore, was constantly engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the parts and parcels of
the Lord, the living beings under his careful administration, were perfectly attended with all comforts in
this life and all progress in the next. That is the way of perfect management of state administration.
