<h2>Text</h2>
api nah suhrdas tata
bandhavah krsna-devatah
drstah sruta va yadavah
sva-puryam sukham asate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
api--whether; nah--our; suhrdah--well-wishers; tata--O my uncle; bandhavah--friends; krsna-devatah--
those who are always rapt in the service of Lord Sri Krsna; drstah--by seeing them; srutah--or by hearing
about them; va--either; yadavah--the descendants of Yadu; sva-puryam--along with their residential place;
sukham asate--if they are all happy.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My uncle, you must have visited Dvaraka. In that holy place are our friends and well-wishers, the
descendants of Yadu, who are always rapt in the service of the Lord Sri Krsna. You might have seen them
or heard about them. Are they all living happily in their abodes?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The particular word krsna-devatah, i.e., those who are always rapt in the service of Lord Krsna, is
significant. The Yadavas and the Pandavas, who were always rapt in the thought of the Lord Krsna and
His different transcendental activities, were all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in
order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lord, but the Pandavas and the Yadavas were
always rapt in the thought of Lord Krsna. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities.
Either remaining at home or leaving home, the real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the
thought of Krsna favorably, i.e., knowing well that Lord Krsna is the Absolute Personality of Godhead.
Kamsa, Jarasandha, Sisupala and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord
Krsna, but they were absorbed in a different way, namely unfavorably, or thinking Him to be a powerful
man only. Therefore, Kamsa and Sisupala are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidura, the
Pandavas and the Yadavas.
Maharaja Yudhisthira was also always rapt in the thought of Lord Krsna and His associates at Dvaraka.
Otherwise he could not have asked all about them from Vidura. Maharaja Yudhisthira was therefore on
the same level of devotion as Vidura, although engaged in the state affairs of the kingdom of the world.
