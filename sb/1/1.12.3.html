tam upasrutya ninadam
jagad-bhaya-bhayavaham
pratyudyayuh prajah sarva
bhartr-darsana-lalasah
SYNONYMS
tam--that; upasrutya--having overheard; ninadam--sound; jagat-bhaya--the fear of material existence;
bhaya-avaham--the threatening principle; prati--towards; udyayuh--rapidly proceeded; prajah--the
citizens; sarvah--all; bhartr--the protector; darsana--audience; lalasah--having so desired.
TRANSLATION
The citizens of Dvaraka, having heard that sound which threatens fear personified in the material world,
began to run towards Him fast, just to have a long desired audience with the Lord, who is the protector of
all devotees.
PURPORT
As already explained, the citizens of Dvaraka who lived at the time of Lord Krsna's presence there were
all liberated souls who descended there along with the Lord as entourage. All were very anxious to have
an audience with the Lord, although because of spiritual contact they were never separated from the Lord.
Just as the gopis at Vrndavana used to think of Krsna while He was away from the village for cowherding
engagements, the citizens of Dvaraka were all immersed in thought of the Lord while He was away from
Dvaraka to attend the Battle of Kuruksetra. Some distinguished fiction writer in Bengal concluded that the
Krsna of Vrndavana, that of Mathura and that of Dvaraka were different personalities. Historically there is
no truth in this conclusion. The Krsna of Kuruksetra and the Krsna of Dvaraka are one and the same
personality.
The citizens of Dvaraka were thus in a state of melancholy due to the Lord's absence from the
transcendental city, as much as we are put in a state of melancholy at night because of the absence of the
sun. The sound heralded by Lord Krsna was something like the heralding of the sunrise in the morning.
So all the citizens of Dvaraka awoke from a state of slumber because of the sunrise of Krsna, and they all
hastened towards Him just to have an audience. The devotees of the Lord know no one else as protector.
This sound of the Lord is identical with the Lord, as we have tried to explain by the nondual position of
the Lord. The material existence of our present status is full of fear. Out of the four problems of material
existence, namely the food problem, the shelter problem, the fear problem and the mating problem, the
fear problem gives us more trouble than the others. We are always fearful due to our ignorance of the next
problem. The whole material existence is full of problems, and thus the fear problem is always prominent.
This is due to our association with the illusory energy of the Lord, known as maya or external energy, yet
all fear is vanished as soon as there is the sound of the Lord, represented by His holy name, as it was
sounded by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in the following sixteen words:
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare
Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare
We can take advantage of these sounds and be free from all threatening problems of material existence.
TEXTS 4-5

atmaramam purna-kamam
nija-labhena nityada
prity-utphulla-mukhah procur
harsa-gadgadaya gira
pitaram sarva-suhrdam

SYNONYMS
tatra--thereupon; upanita--having offered; balayah--presentations; raveh--up to the sun; dipam--lamp;
iva--like; adrtah--being evaluated; atma-aramam--unto the self-sufficient; purna-kamam--fully satisfied;
nija-labhena--by His own potencies; nitya-da--one who supplies incessantly; priti--affection; utphullamukhah--
cheerful faces; procuh--said; harsa--gladdened; gadgadaya--ecstatic; gira--speeches; pitaram--
unto the father; sarva--all; suhrdam--friends; avitaram--the guardian; iva--like; arbhakah--wards.
TRANSLATION
The citizens arrived before the Lord with their respective presentations, offering them to the fully
satisfied and self-sufficient one, who, by His own potency, incessantly supplies others. These
presentations were like the offering of a lamp to the sun. Yet the citizens began to speak in ecstatic
language to receive the Lord, just as wards welcome their guardian and father.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord Krsna is described herein as atmarama. He is self-sufficient, and there is no need for
Him to seek happiness from anything beyond Himself. He is self-sufficient because His very
transcendental existence is total bliss. He is eternally existent; He is all-cognizant and all-blissful.
Therefore, any presentation, however valuable it may be, is not needed by Him. But still, because He is the
well-wisher for one and all, He accepts from everyone everything that is offered to Him in pure devotional
service. It is not that He is in want for such things, because the things are themselves generated from His
energy. The comparison is made herein that making offerings to the Lord is something like offering a
lamp in the worship of the sun-god. Anything fiery and illuminating is but an emanation of the energy of
the sun, and yet to worship the sun-god it is necessary to offer him a lamp. In the worship of the sun,
there is some sort of demand made by the worshiper, but in the case of devotional service to the Lord,
there is no question of demand from either side. It is all a sign of pure love and affection between the Lord
and the devotee.
The Lord is the Supreme Father of all living beings, and therefore those who are conscious of this vital
relation with God can make filial demands from the Father, and the Father is pleased to supply the
demands of such obedient sons without bargaining. The Lord is just like the desire tree, and from Him
everyone can have everything by the causeless mercy of the Lord. As the Supreme Father, the Lord,
however, does not supply to a pure devotee what is considered to be a barrier to the discharge of
devotional service. Those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord can rise to the position of
unalloyed devotional service by His transcendental attraction.
