<h2>Translation</h2>
We all respectfully want to hear about him [Maharaja Pariksit] to whom Sukadeva Gosvami imparted
transcendental knowledge. Please speak on this matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami imparted transcendental knowledge to Maharaja Pariksit during the remaining seven
days of his life, and Maharaja Pariksit heard him properly, just like an ardent student. The effect of such a
bona fide hearing and chanting of Srimad-Bhagavatam was equally shared by both the hearer and the
chanter. Both of them were benefited. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service
to the Lord prescribed in the Bhagavatam, either all of them, or some of them or even one of them are
equally beneficial if properly discharged. Maharaja Pariksit and Sukadeva Gosvami were serious
performers of the first two important items, namely the process of chanting and the process of hearing,
and therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Transcendental realization is
attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual master and
disciple much advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the
disciple by an electrical current generated by the master, and the disciple begins to feel the shock. He
becomes unconscious, and the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such
bogus advertisement is going on in this age, and the poor common man is becoming the victim of such
advertisement. We do not find such folk tales in the dealings of Sukadeva Gosvami and his great disciple
Maharaja Pariksit. The sage recited Srimad-Bhagavatam in devotion, and the great King heard him
properly. The King did not feel any shock of electrical current from the master, nor did he become
unconscious while receiving knowledge from the master. One should not, therefore, become a victim of
these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge. The sages of
Naimisaranya were very respectful in hearing about Maharaja Pariksit because of his receiving knowledge
from Sukadeva Gosvami by means of ardent hearing. Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only
way to receive transcendental knowledge, and there is no need for medical performances or occult
mysticism for miraculous effects. The process is simple, but only the sincere party can achieve the desired
result.
