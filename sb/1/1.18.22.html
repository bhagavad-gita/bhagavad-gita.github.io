<h2>Translation</h2>
Self-controlled persons who are attached to the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna can all of a sudden give up the
world of material attachment, including the gross body and subtle mind, and go away to attain the highest
perfection of the renounced order of life, by which nonviolence and renunciation are consequential.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Only the self-controlled can gradually be attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Selfcontrolled
means not indulging in sense enjoyment more than is necessary. And those who are not selfcontrolled
are given over to sense enjoyment. Dry philosophical speculation is a subtle sense enjoyment of
the mind. Sense enjoyment leads one to the path of darkness. Those who are self-controlled can make
progress on the path of liberation from the conditional life of material existence. The Vedas, therefore,
enjoin that one should not go on the path of darkness but should make a progressive march towards the
path of light or liberation. Self-control is actually achieved not by artificially stopping the senses from
material enjoyment, but by becoming factually attached to the Supreme Lord by engaging one's unalloyed
senses in the transcendental service of the Lord. The senses cannot be forcibly curbed, but they can be
given proper engagement. Purified senses, therefore, are always engaged in the transcendental service of
the Lord. This perfectional stage of sense engagement is called bhakti-yoga. So those who are attached to
the means of bhakti-yoga are factually self-controlled and can all of a sudden give up their homely or
bodily attachment for the service of the Lord. This is called the paramahamsa stage. Hamsas, or swans,
accept only milk out of a mixture of milk and water. Similarly, those who accept the service of the Lord
instead of maya's service are called the paramahamsas. They are naturally qualified with all the good
attributes, such as pridelessness, freedom from vanity, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, respectability,
worship, devotion and sincerity. All these godly qualities exist in the devotee of the Lord spontaneously.
Such paramahamsas, who are completely given up to the service of the Lord, are very rare. They are very
rare even amongst the liberated souls. Real nonviolence means freedom from envy. In this world everyone
is envious of his fellow being. But a perfect paramahamsa, being completely given up to the service of the
Lord, is perfectly nonenvious. He loves every living being in relation with the Supreme Lord. Real
renunciation means perfect dependence on God. Every living being is dependent on someone else because
he is so made. Actually everyone is dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, but when one forgets
his relation with the Lord, he becomes dependent on the conditions of material nature. Renunciation
means renouncing ones dependence on the conditions of material nature and thus becoming completely
dependent on the mercy of the Lord. Real independence means complete faith in the mercy of the Lord
without dependence on the conditions of matter. This paramahamsa stage is the highest perfectional stage
in bhakti-yoga, the process of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.
