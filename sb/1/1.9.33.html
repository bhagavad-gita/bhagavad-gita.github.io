<h2>Text</h2>
tri-bhuvana-kamanam tamala-varnam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tri-bhuvana--three statuses of planetary systems; kamanam--the most desirable; tamala-varnam--bluish
like the tamala tree; ravi-kara--sun rays; gaura--golden color; varambaram--glittering dress; dadhane--one
who wears; vapuh--body; alaka-kula-avrta--covered with paintings of sandalwood pulp; anana-abjam--face
like a lotus; vijaya-sakhe--unto the friend of Arjuna; ratih astu--may attraction be reposed upon Him; me--
my; anavadya--without desire for fruitive results.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Krsna is the intimate friend of Arjuna. He has appeared on this earth in His transcendental body,
which resembles the bluish color of the tamala tree. His body attracts everyone in the three planetary
systems [upper, middle and lower]. May His glittering yellow dress and His lotus face, covered with
paintings of sandalwood pulp, be the object of my attraction, and may I not desire fruitive results.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Sri Krsna by His own internal pleasure appears on earth, He does so by the agency of His internal
potency. The attractive features of His transcendental body are desired in all the three worlds, namely the
upper, middle and lower planetary systems. Nowhere in the universe are there such beautiful bodily
features as those of Lord Krsna. Therefore His transcendental body has nothing to do with anything
materially created. Arjuna is described here as the conqueror, and Krsna is described as his intimate
friend. Bhismadeva, on his bed of arrows after the Battle of Kuruksetra, is remembering the particular
dress of Lord Krsna which He put on as the driver of Arjuna's chariot. While fighting was going on
between Arjuna and Bhisma, Bhisma's attraction was drawn by the glittering dress of Krsna, and indirectly
he admired his so-called enemy Arjuna for possessing the Lord as his friend. Arjuna was always a
conqueror because the Lord was his friend. Bhismadeva takes this opportunity to address the Lord as
vijaya-sakhe (friend of Arjuna) because the Lord is pleased when He is addressed conjointly with His
devotees, who are related with Him in different transcendental humors. While Krsna was the charioteer of
Arjuna, sun rays glittered on the dress of the Lord, and the beautiful hue created by the reflection of such
rays was never forgotten by Bhismadeva. As a great fighter he was relishing the relation of Krsna in the
chivalrous humor. Transcendental relation with the Lord in any one of the different rasas (humors) is
relishable by the respective devotees in the highest ecstasy. Less intelligent mundaners who want to make
a show of being transcendentally related with the Lord artificially jump at once to the relation of conjugal
love, imitating the damsels of Vrajadhama. Such a cheap relation with the Lord exhibits only the base
mentality of the mundaner because one who has relished conjugal humor with the Lord cannot be
attached to worldly conjugal rasa, which is condemned even by mundane ethics. The eternal relation of a
particular soul with the Lord is evolved. A genuine relation of the living being with the Supreme Lord can
take any form out of the five principal rasas, and it does not make any difference in transcendental degree
to the genuine devotee. Bhismadeva is a concrete example of this, and it should be carefully observed how
the great general is transcendentally related with the Lord.
