<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The value of a moment's association with the devotee of the Lord cannot even be compared to the
attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter, and what to speak of worldly benedictions in the
form of material prosperity, which are for those who are meant for death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When there are some similar points, it is possible to compare one thing to another. One cannot compare
the association of a pure devotee to anything material. Men who are addicted to material happiness aspire
to reach the heavenly planets like the moon, Venus and Indraloka, and those who are advanced in
material philosophical speculations aspire after liberation from all material bondage. When one becomes
frustrated with all kinds of material advancement, one desires the opposite type of liberation, which is
called apunar-bhava, or no rebirth. But the pure devotees of the Lord do not aspire after the happiness
obtained in the heavenly kingdom, nor do they aspire after liberation from material bondage. In other
words, for the pure devotees of the Lord the material pleasures obtainable in the heavenly planets are like
phantasmagoria, and because they are already liberated from all material conceptions of pleasure and
distress, they are factually liberated even in the material world. This means that the pure devotees of the
Lord are engaged in a transcendental existence, namely in the loving service of the Lord, both in the
material world and in the spiritual world. As a government servant is always the same, either in the office
or at home or at any place, so a devotee has nothing to do with anything material, for he is exclusively
engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. Since he has nothing to do with anything material,
what pleasure can he derive from material benedictions like kingship or other overlordships, which are
finished quickly with the end of the body? Devotional service is eternal; it has no end, because it is
spiritual. Therefore, since the assets of a pure devotee are completely different from material assets, there
is no comparison between the two. Suta Gosvami was a pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his
association with the rsis in Naimisaranya is unique. In the material world, association with gross
materialists is veritably condemned. The materialist is called yosit-sangi, or one who is much attached to
material entanglement (women and other paraphernalia). Such attachment is conditioned because it
drives away the benedictions of life and prosperity. And just the opposite is bhagavata-sangi, or one who
is always in the association with the Lord's name, form, qualities, etc. Such association is always desirable;
it is worshipable, it is praiseworthy, and one may accept it as the highest goal of life.
