<h2>Translation</h2>
On the banks at Saptasrota, Dhrtarastra is now engaged in beginning astanga-yoga by bathing three
times daily, in the morning, noon and evening, by performing the Agni-hotra sacrifice with fire and by
drinking only water. This helps one control the mind and the senses and frees one completely from
thoughts of familial affection.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The yoga system is a mechanical way to control the senses and the mind and divert them from matter to
spirit. The preliminary processes are the sitting posture, meditation, spiritual thoughts, manipulation of
air passing within the body, and gradual situation in trance, facing the Absolute Person, Paramatma. Such
mechanical ways of rising to the spiritual platform prescribe some regulative principles of taking bath
daily three times, fasting as far as possible, sitting and concentrating the mind on spiritual matters and
thus gradually becoming free from visaya, or material objectives. Material existence means to be absorbed
in the material objective, which is simply illusory. House, country, family, society, children, property, and
business are some of the material coverings of the spirit, atma, and the yoga system helps one to become
free from all these illusory thoughts and gradually turn towards the Absolute Person, Paramatma. By
material association and education, we learn simply to concentrate on flimsy things, but yoga is the
process of forgetting them altogether. Modern so-called yogis and yoga systems manifest some magical
feats, and ignorant persons are attracted by such false things, or they accept the yoga system as a cheap
healing process for diseases of the gross body. But factually the yoga system is the process of learning to
forget what we have acquired throughout the struggle for existence. Dhrtarastra was all along engaged in
improving family affairs by raising the standard of living of his sons or by usurping the property of the
Pandavas for the sake of his own sons. These are common affairs for a man grossly materialistic and
without knowledge of the spiritual force. He does not see how this can drag one from heaven to hell. By
the grace of his younger brother Vidura, Dhrtarastra was enlightened and could see his grossly illusory
engagements, and by such enlightenment he was able to leave home for spiritual realization. Sri
Naradadeva was just foretelling the way of his spiritual progress in a place which was sanctified by the
flow of the celestial Ganges. Drinking water only, without solid food, is also considered fasting. This is
necessary for advancement of spiritual knowledge. A foolish man wants to be a cheap yogi without
observing the regulative principles. A man who has no control over the tongue at first can hardly become
a yogi. Yogi and bhogi are two opposite terms. The bhogi, or the merry man who eats and drinks, cannot
be a yogi, for a yogi is never allowed to eat and drink unrestrictedly. We may note with profit how
Dhrtarastra began his yoga system by drinking water only and sitting calmly in a place with a spiritual
atmosphere, deeply absorbed in the thoughts of the Lord Hari, the Personality of Godhead.
