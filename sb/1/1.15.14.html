<h2>Text</h2>
yad-bandhavah kuru-balabdhim ananta-param
eko rathena tatare 'ham atirya-sattvam
pratyahrtam bahu dhanam ca maya paresam
tejas-padam manimayam ca hrtam sirobhyah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat-bandhavah--by whose friendship only; kuru-bala-abdhim--the ocean of the military strength of the
Kurus; ananta-param--which was insurmountable; ekah--alone; rathena--being seated on the chariot;
tatare--was able to cross over; aham--myself; atirya--invincible; sattvam--existence; pratyahrtam--drew
back; bahu--very large quantity; dhanam--wealth; ca--also; maya--by my; paresam--of the enemy; tejahpadam--
source of brilliance; mani-mayam--bedecked with jewels; ca--also; hrtam--taken by force;
sirobhyah--from their heads.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The military strength of the Kauravas was like an ocean in which there dwelled many invincible
existences, and thus it was insurmountable. But because of His friendship, I, seated on the chariot, was
able to cross over it. And only by His grace was I able to regain the cows and also collect by force many
helmets of the kings which were bedecked with jewels that were sources of all brilliance.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
On the Kaurava side there were many stalwart commanders like Bhisma, Drona, Krpa and Karna, and
their military strength was as insurmountable as the great ocean. And yet it was due to Lord Krsna's grace
that Arjuna alone, sitting on the chariot, could manage to vanquish them one after another without
difficulty. There were many changes of commanders on the other side, but on the Pandavas' side Arjuna
alone on the chariot driven by Lord Krsna could manage the whole responsibility of the great war.
Similarly, when the Pandavas were living at the palace of Virata incognito, the Kauravas picked a quarrel
with King Virata and decided to take away his large number of cows. While they were taking away the
cows, Arjuna fought with them incognito and was able to regain the cows along with some booty taken by
force--the jewels set on the turbans of the royal order. Arjuna remembered that all this was possible by the
grace of the Lord.
