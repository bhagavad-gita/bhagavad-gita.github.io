<h2>Translation</h2>
The supreme duty of the ruling king is to give all protection to law-abiding persons and to chastise
those who stray from the ordinances of the scriptures in ordinary times, when there is no emergency.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the scriptures there is mention of apad-dharma, or occupational duty at times of extraordinary
happenings. It is said that sometimes the great sage Visvamitra had to live on the flesh of dogs in some
extraordinary dangerous position. In cases of emergency, one may be allowed to live on the flesh of
animals of all description, but that does not mean that there should be regular slaughterhouses to feed the
animal-eaters and that this system should he encouraged by the state. No one should try to live on flesh in
ordinary times simply for the sake of the palate. If anyone does so, the king or the executive head should
punish him for gross enjoyment.
There are regular scriptural injunctions for different persons engaged in different occupational duties,
and one who follows them is called svadharma-stha, or faithful in one's prescribed duties. In the
Bhagavad-gita (18.48) it is advised that one should not give up his occupational prescribed duties, even if
they are not always flawless. Such sva-dharma might be violated in cases of emergency, if one is forced by
circumstances, but they cannot be violated in ordinary times. The state executive head is to see that such
sva-dharma is not changed by the follower, whatever it may be, and he should give all protection to the
follower of sva-dharma. The violator is subject to punishment in terms of the sastra, and the duty of the
king is to see that everyone strictly follows his occupational duty, as prescribed in the scripture.
