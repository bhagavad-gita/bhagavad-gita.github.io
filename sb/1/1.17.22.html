TRANSLATION
The so-called administrators are now bewildered by the influence of this age of Kali, and thus they have
put all state affairs into disorder. Are you now lamenting this disorder? Now the general populace does
not follow the rules and regulations for eating, sleeping, drinking, mating, etc., and they are inclined to
perform such anywhere and everywhere. Are you unhappy because of this?
PURPORT
There are some necessities of life on a par with those of the lower animals, and they are eating, sleeping,
fearing and mating. These bodily demands are for both the human beings and the animals. But the human
being has to fulfill such desires not like animals, but like a human being. A dog can mate with a bitch
before the public eyes without hesitation, but if a human being does so the act will be considered a public
nuisance, and the person will be criminally prosecuted. Therefore for the human being there are some
rules and regulations, even for fulfilling common demands. The human society avoids such rules and
regulations when it is bewildered by the influence of the age of Kali. In this age, people are indulging in
such necessities of life without following the rules and regulations, and this deterioration of social and
moral rules is certainly lamentable because of the harmful effects of such beastly behavior. In this age, the
fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. They should know that so many
innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of this age of Kali. We know
from Srimad-Bhagavatam that Ajamila, an innocent son of a brahmana, was walking down a road and saw
a sudra pair sexually embracing. This attracted the boy, and later on the boy became a victim of all
debaucheries. From a pure brahmana, he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin, and it was all due
to bad association. There was but one victim like Ajamila in those days, but in this age of Kali the poor
innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. The so-called
administrators are all untrained in the affairs of a ksatriya. The ksatriyas are meant for administration, as
the brahmanas are meant for knowledge and guidance. The word ksatra-bandhu refers to the so-called
administrators or persons promoted to the post of the administrator without proper training by culture
and tradition. Nowadays they are promoted to such exalted posts by the votes of the people who are
themselves fallen in the rules and regulations of life. How can such people select a proper man when they
are themselves fallen in the standard of life? Therefore, by the influence of the age of Kali, everywhere,
politically, socially or religiously, everything is topsy-turvy, and therefore for the sane man it is all
regrettable.
