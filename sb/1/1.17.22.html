dharmo 'si vrsa-rupa-dhrk
yad adharma-krtah sthanam
sucakasyapi tad bhavet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
raja uvaca--the King said; dharmam--religion; bravisi--as you speak; dharma-jna--O one who knows the
codes of religion; dharmah--the personality of religion; asi--you are; vrsa-rupa-dhrk--in the disguise of a
bull; yat--whatever; adharma-krtah--one who acts irreligiously; sthanam--place; sucakasya--of the
identifier; api--also; tat--that; bhavet--becomes.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The King said: O you, who are in the form of a bull! You know the truth of religion, and you are
speaking according to the principle that the destination intended for the perpetrator of irreligious acts is
also intended for one who identifies the perpetrator. You are no other than the personality of religion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A devotee's conclusion is that no one is directly responsible for being a benefactor or mischief-monger
without the sanction of the Lord; therefore he does not consider anyone to be directly responsible for
such action. But in both the cases he takes it for granted that either benefit or loss is God-sent, and thus it
is His grace. In case of benefit, no one will deny that it is God-sent, but in case of loss or reverses one
becomes doubtful about how the Lord could be so unkind to His devotee as to put him in great difficulty.
Jesus Christ was seemingly put into such great difficulty, being crucified by the ignorant, but he was never
angry at the mischief-mongers. That is the way of accepting a thing, either favorable or unfavorable. Thus
for a devotee the identifier is equally a sinner, like the mischief-monger. By God's grace, the devotee
tolerates all reverses. Maharaja Pariksit observed this, and therefore he could understand that the bull was
no other than the personality of religion himself. In other words, a devotee has no suffering at all because
so-called suffering is also God's grace for a devotee who sees God in everything. The cow and bull never
placed any complaint before the King for being tortured by the personality of Kali, although everyone
lodges such complaints before the state authorities. The extraordinary behavior of the bull made the King
conclude that the bull was certainly the personality of religion, for no one else could understand the finer
intricacies of the codes of religion.
