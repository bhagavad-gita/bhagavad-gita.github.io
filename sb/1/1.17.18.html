<h2>Text</h2>
na vayam klesa-bijani
yatah syuh purusarsabha
purusam tam vijanimo
vakya-bheda-vimohitah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; vayam--we; klesa-bijani--the root cause of sufferings; yatah--wherefrom; syuh--it so happens;
purusa-rsabha--O greatest of all human beings; purusam--the person; tam--that; vijanimah--know; vakyabheda--
difference of opinion; vimohitah--bewildered by.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O greatest among human beings, it is very difficult to ascertain the particular miscreant who has caused
our sufferings, because we are bewildered by all the different opinions of theoretical philosophers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many theoretical philosophers in the world who put forward their own theories of cause and
effect especially about the cause of suffering and its effect on different living beings. Generally there are
six great philosophers: Kanada, the author of Vaisesika philosophy; Gautama, the author of logic;
Patanjali, the author of mystic yoga; Kapila, the author of Sankhya philosophy; Jaimini, the author of
Karma-mimamsa; and Vyasadeva, the author of Vedanta-darsana.
Although the bull, or the personality of religion, and the cow, the personality of the earth, knew
perfectly well that the personality of Kali was the direct cause of their sufferings, still, as devotees of the
Lord, they knew well also that without the sanction of the Lord no one could inflict trouble upon them.
According to the Padma Purana, our present trouble is due to the fructifying of seedling sins, but even
those seedling sins also gradually fade away by execution of pure devotional service. Thus even if the
devotees see the mischief-mongers, they do not accuse them for the sufferings inflicted. They take it for
granted that the mischief-monger is made to act by some indirect cause, and therefore they tolerate the
sufferings, thinking them to be God-given in small doses, for otherwise the sufferings should have been
greater.
Maharaja Pariksit wanted to get a statement of accusation against the direct mischief-monger, but they
declined to give it on the abovementioned grounds. Speculative philosophers, however, do not recognize
the sanction of the Lord; they try to find out the cause of sufferings in their own way, as will be described
in the following verses. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, such speculators are themselves bewildered, and
thus they cannot know that the ultimate cause of all causes is the Supreme Lord, the Personality of
Godhead.
