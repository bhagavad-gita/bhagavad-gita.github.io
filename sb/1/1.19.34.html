<h2>Text</h2>
sannidhyat te maha-yogin
patakani mahanty api
sadyo nasyanti vai pumsam
visnor iva suretarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

invulnerable; api--in spite of; sadyah--immediately; nasyanti--vanquished; vai--certainly; pumsam--of a
person; visnoh--like the presence of the Personality of Godhead; iva--like; sura-itarah--other than the
demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Just as the atheist cannot remain in the presence of the Personality of Godhead, so also the invulnerable
sins of a man are immediately vanquished in your presence, O saint! O great mystic!
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are two classes of human beings, namely the atheist and the devotee of the Lord. The devotee of
the Lord, because of manifesting godly qualities, is called a demigod, whereas the atheist is called a
demon. The demon cannot stand the presence of Visnu, the Personality of Godhead. The demons are
always busy in trying to vanquish the Personality of Godhead, but factually as soon as the Personality of
Godhead appears, by either His transcendental name, form, attributes, pastimes, paraphernalia or
variegatedness, the demon is at once vanquished. It is said that a ghost cannot remain as soon as the holy
name of the Lord is chanted. The great saints and devotees of the Lord are in the list of His paraphernalia,
and thus as soon as a saintly devotee is present, the ghostly sins are at once vanquished. That is the
verdict of all Vedic literatures. One is recommended, therefore, to associate only with saintly devotees so
that worldly demons and ghosts cannot exert their sinister influence.
