<h2>Translation</h2>
The personality of Kali asked for something more, and because of his begging, the King gave him
permission to live where there is gold because wherever there is gold there is also falsity, intoxication,
lust, envy and enmity.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although Maharaja Pariksit gave Kali permission to live in four places, it was very difficult for him to
find the places because during the reign of Maharaja Pariksit there were no such places. Therefore Kali
asked the King to give him something practical which could be utilized for his nefarious purposes.
Maharaja Pariksit thus gave him permission to live in a place where there is gold, because wherever there
is gold there are all the above-mentioned four things, and over and above them there is enmity also. So
the personality of Kali became gold-standardized. According to Srimad-Bhagavatam, gold encourages
falsity, intoxication, prostitution, envy and enmity. Even a gold-standard exchange and currency is bad.
Gold-standard currency is based on falsehood because the currency is not on a par with the reserved gold.
The basic principle is falsity because currency notes are issued in value beyond that of the actual reserved
gold. This artificial inflation of currency by the authorities encourages prostitution of the state economy.
The price of commodities becomes artificially inflated because of bad money, or artificial currency notes.
Bad money drives away good money. Instead of paper currency, actual gold coins should be used for
exchange, and this will stop prostitution of gold. Gold ornaments for women may be allowed by control,
not by quality, but by quantity. This will discourage lust, envy and enmity. When there is actual gold
currency in the form of coins, the influence of gold in producing falsity, prostitution, etc., will
automatically cease. There will be no need of an anticorruption ministry for another term of prostitution
and falsity of purpose.
