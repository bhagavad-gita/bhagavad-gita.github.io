<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: O brahmanas, King Yudhisthira fully supported the statements of the Queen, which
were in accordance with the principles of religion and were justified, glorious, full of mercy and equity,
and without duplicity.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira, who was the son of Dharmaraja, or Yamaraja, fully supported the words of Queen
Draupadi in asking Arjuna to release Asvatthama. One should not tolerate the humiliation of a member of
a great family. Arjuna and his family were indebted to the family of Dronacarya because of Arjuna's
learning the military science from him. If ingratitude were shown to such a benevolent family, it would
not be at all justified from the moral standpoint. The wife of Dronacarya, who was the half body of the
great soul, must be treated with compassion, and she should not be put into grief because of her son's
death. That is compassion. Such statements by Draupadi are without duplicity because actions should be
taken with full knowledge. The feeling of equality was there because Draupadi spoke out of her personal
experience. A barren woman cannot understand the grief of a mother. Draupadi was herself a mother, and
therefore her calculation of the depth of Krpi's grief was quite to the point. And it was glorious because
she wanted to show proper respect to a great family.
