<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord was enriched with four hands, earrings of molten gold and eyes blood red with fury. As He
loitered about, His club constantly encircled Him like a shooting star.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said in the Brahma-samhita (Ch. 5) that the Supreme Lord Govinda, by His one plenary portion,
enters into the halo of the universe and distributes himself as Paramatma, or the Supersoul, not only
within the heart of every living being, but also within every atom of the material elements. Thus the Lord
is all-pervading by His inconceivable potency, and thus He entered the womb of Uttara to save His
beloved devotee Maharaja Pariksit. In the Bhagavad-gita (9.31) the Lord assured everyone that His
devotees are never to be vanquished. No one can kill a devotee of the Lord because he is protected by the
Lord, and no one can save a person whom the Lord desires to kill. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore
He can both save and kill as He likes. He became visible to His devotee Maharaja Pariksit even in that
awkward position (in the womb of his mother) in a shape just suitable for his vision. The Lord can
become bigger than thousands of universes and can become smaller than an atom at the same time.
Merciful as He is, He becomes just suitable to the vision of the limited living being. He is unlimited. He is
not limited by any measurement of our calculation. He can become bigger than what we can think of, and
He can become smaller than what we can conceive. But in all circumstances He is the same all-powerful
Lord. There is no difference between the thumblike Visnu in the womb of Uttara and the full-fledged
Narayana in the Vaikuntha-dhama, the kingdom of Godhead. He accepts the form of arca-vigraha
(worshipable Deity) just to accept service from His different incapable devotees. By the mercy of the arcavigraha,
the form of the Lord in material elements, the devotees who are in the material world can easily
approach the Lord, although He is not conceivable by the material senses. The arca-vigraha is therefore an
all-spiritual form of the Lord to be perceived by the material devotees; such an arca-vigraha of the Lord is
never to be considered material. There is no difference between matter and spirit for the Lord, although
there is a gulf of difference between the two in the case of the conditioned living being. For the Lord there
is nothing but spiritual existence, and similarly there is nothing except spiritual existence for the pure
devotee of the Lord in his intimate relation with the Lord.
