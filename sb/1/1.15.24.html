<h2>Text</h2>
prayenaitad bhagavata
isvarasya vicestitam
mitho nighnanti bhutani
bhavayanti ca yan mithah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prayena etat--it is almost by; bhagavatah--of the Personality of Godhead; isvarasya--of the Lord;
vicestitam--by the will of; mithah--one another; nighnanti--do kill; bhutani--the living beings;
bhavayanti--as also protect; ca--also; yat--of whom; mithah--one another.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Factually this is all due to the supreme will of the Lord, the Personality of Godhead. Sometimes people
kill one another, and at other times they protect one another.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the anthropologists, there is nature's law of struggle for existence and survival of the
fittest. But they do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the
direction of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is peace in the world, it must be known that it is due to
the good will of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the world, it is also due to the supreme will
of the Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Whenever, therefore, there is
disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lord, there is war between men and nations. The
surest way to the path of peace, therefore, is dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord.
The established rule is that whatever we do, whatever we eat, whatever we sacrifice or whatever we give in
charity must be done to the full satisfaction of the Lord. No one should do anything, eat anything,
sacrifice anything or give anything in charity against the will of the Lord. Discretion is the better part of
valor, and one must learn how to discriminate between actions which may be pleasing to the Lord and
those which may not be pleasing to the Lord. An action is thus judged by the Lord's pleasure or
displeasure. There is no room for personal whims; we must always be guided by the pleasure of the Lord.
Such action is called yogah karmasu kausalam, or actions performed which are linked with the Supreme
Lord. That is the art of doing a thing perfectly.

mahanto balino mithah
evam balisthair yadubhir
mahadbhir itaran vibhuh
yadun yadubhir anyonyam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

among one another; bhu-bharan--the burden of the world; sanjahara--has unloaded; ha--in the past.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, as in the ocean the bigger and stronger aquatics swallow up the smaller and weaker ones, so
also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to lighten the burden of the earth, has engaged the stronger
Yadu to kill the weaker, and the bigger Yadu to kill the smaller.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world the struggle for existence and survival of the fittest are laws because in the
material world there is disparity between conditioned souls due to everyone's desire to lord it over the
material resources. This very mentality of lording it over the material nature is the root cause of
conditioned life. And to give facility to such imitation lords, the illusory energy of the Lord has created a
disparity between conditioned living beings by creating the stronger and the weaker in every species of
life. The mentality of lording it over the material nature and the creation has naturally created a disparity
and therefore the law of struggle for existence. In the spiritual world there is no such disparity, nor is
there such a struggle for existence. In the spiritual world there is no struggle for existence because
everyone there exists eternally. There is no disparity because everyone wants to render service to the
Supreme Lord, and no one wants to imitate the Lord in becoming the beneficiary. The Lord, being creator
of everything, including the living beings, factually is the proprietor and enjoyer of everything that be, but
in the material world, by the spell of maya, or illusion, this eternal relation with the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is forgotten, and so the living being is conditioned under the law of struggle for existence and
survival of the fittest.
