<h2>Translation</h2>
The King, not received by any formal welcome by means of being offered a seat, place, water and sweet
addresses, considered himself neglected, and so thinking he became angry.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The law of reception in the codes of the Vedic principles states that even if an enemy is received at
home, he must be received with all respects. He should not be given a chance to understand that he has
come into the house of an enemy. When Lord Krsna, accompanied by Arjuna and Bhima, approached
Jarasandha in Magadha, the respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jarasandha. The
guest enemy, namely Bhima, was to fight with Jarasandha, and yet they were given a grand reception. At
night they used to sit down together as friends and guests, and in the day they used to fight, risking life
and death. That was the law of reception. The reception law enjoins that a poor man, who has nothing to
offer his guest, should be good enough to offer a straw mat for sitting, a glass of water for drinking and
some sweet words. Therefore, to receive a guest, either friend or foe, there is no expense. It is only a
question of good manners.
When Maharaja Pariksit entered the door of Samika Rsi, he did not expect a royal reception by the rsi
because he knew that saints and rsis are not materially rich men. But he never expected that a seat of
straw, a glass of water and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guest, nor
was he an enemy of the rsi, and therefore the cold reception by the rsi astonished the King greatly. As a
matter of fact, the King was right to get angry with the rsi when he needed a glass of water very badly. To
become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the King, but because the King himself was
not less than a great saint, his becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. So it must be accepted
that it was so ordained by the supreme will of the Lord. The King was a great devotee of the Lord, and the
saint was also as good as the King. But by the will of the Lord, the circumstances were so created that they
became ways to the King's becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and
thus becoming a completely surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord Krsna. The merciful Lord
sometimes creates such awkward positions for his pure devotees in order to drag them towards Himself
from the mire of material existence. But outwardly the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees.
The devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lord, and in any condition, frustration or
success, the Lord is the supreme guide for the devotees. The pure devotees, therefore, accept all
conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord.
