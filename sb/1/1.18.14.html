<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna [Govinda], is the exclusive shelter for all great living beings,
and His transcendental attributes cannot even be measured by such masters of mystic powers as Lord Siva
and Lord Brahma. Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing
topics about Him?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva and Lord Brahma are two chiefs of the demigods. They are full of mystic powers. For example,
Lord Siva drank an ocean of poison of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being.
Similarly, Brahma could create many powerful demigods, including Lord Siva. So they are isvaras, or lords
of the universe. But they are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is Govinda, Lord Krsna.
He is the Transcendence, and His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful
isvaras as Siva and Brahma. Therefore Lord Krsna is the exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living
beings. Brahma is counted amongst the living beings, but he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the
greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental topics of Lord Krsna? Because He
is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Everyone wants to relish some kind of taste in everything, but one who is
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such
engagement. The Lord is unlimited, and His name, attributes, pastimes, entourage, variegatedness, etc. are
unlimited, and those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated. This fact is
confirmed in the Padma Purana:
ramante yogino 'nante
satyananda-cid-atmani
iti rama-padenasau
param brahmabhidhiyate
"The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the
Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as Rama."
There is no end to such transcendental discourses. In mundane affairs there is the law of satiation, but
in transcendence there is no such satiation. Suta Gosvami desired to continue the topics of Lord Krsna
before the sages of Naimisaranya, and the sages also expressed their readiness to hear from him
continuously. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes are transcendental, such discourses
increase the receptive mood of the purified audience.
