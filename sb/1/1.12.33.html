<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Marutta: one of the great emperors of the world. He reigned over the world long before the
reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was the son of Maharaja Aviksit and was a great devotee of the son of
the sun-god, known as Yamaraja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great Brhaspati, the
learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Sankara-yajna by which the Lord was so
satisfied that He was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold
is somewhere in the Himalaya Mountains, and modern adventurers may try to find it there. He was so
powerful an emperor that at the day's end of sacrifice, the demigods from the other planets like Indra,
Candra and Brhaspati used to visit his palace. And because he had the gold peak at his disposal, he had
sufficient gold in his possession. The canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. in his
daily performances of the sacrificial ceremonies, some of the inhabitants of the Vayuloka (airy planets)
were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the
ceremony was led by Visvadeva.
By his constant pious work he was able to drive out all kinds of diseases from the jurisdiction of his
kingdom. All the inhabitants of higher planets like Devaloka and Pitrloka were pleased with him for his
great sacrificial ceremonies. Every day he used to give in charity to the learned brahmanas such things as
beddings, seats, conveyances and sufficient quantities of gold. Because of munificent charities and
performances of innumerable sacrifices, the King of heaven, Indradeva, was fully satisfied with him and
always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activities, he remained a young man throughout his life
and reigned over the world for one thousand years, surrounded by his satisfied subjects, ministers,
legitimate wife, sons and brothers. Even Lord Sri Krsna praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed
over his only daughter to Maharsi Angira, and by his good blessings, he was elevated to the kingdom of
heaven. First of all, he wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned Brhaspati, but the
demigod refused to accept the post because of the King's being a human being, a man of this earth. He
was very sorry for this, but on the advice of Narada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the post, and he was
successful in his mission.
The success of a particular type of sacrifice completely depends on the priest in charge. In this age, all
kinds of sacrifice are forbidden because there is no learned priest amongst the so-called brahmanas, who
go by the false notion of becoming sons of brahmanas without brahminical qualifications. In this age of
Kali, therefore, only one kind of sacrifice is recommended, sankirtana-yajna, as inaugurated by Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
