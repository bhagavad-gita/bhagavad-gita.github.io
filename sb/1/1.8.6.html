yajayitva--by performing; asvamedhaih--yajna in which a horse is sacrificed; tam--him (King
Yudhisthira); tribhih--three; uttama--best; kalpakaih--supplied with proper ingredients and performed by
able priests; tat--that; yasah--fame; pavanam--virtuous; diksu--all directions; sata-manyoh--Indra, who
performed one hundred such sacrifices; iva--like; atanot--spread.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna caused three well-performed Asvamedha-yajnas [horse sacrifices] to be conducted by
Maharaja Yudhisthira and thus caused his virtuous fame to be glorified in all directions, like that of Indra,
who had performed one hundred such sacrifices.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is something like the preface to the performances of Asvamedha-yajna by Maharaja Yudhisthira.
The comparison of Maharaja Yudhisthira to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is
thousands and thousands of times greater than Maharaja Yudhisthira in opulence, yet the fame of
Maharaja Yudhisthira was not less. The reason is that Maharaja Yudhisthira was a pure devotee of the
Lord, and by His grace only was King Yudhisthira on the level of the King of heaven, even though he
performed only three yajnas whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of
the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyone, but a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because
he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributed, but still there are some
places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarly, those who
are cent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lord, which is always equally
distributed everywhere.
