<h2>Translation</h2>
The highways, subways, lanes, markets and public meeting places were all thoroughly cleansed and
then moistened with scented water. And to welcome the Lord, fruits, flowers and unbroken seeds were
strewn everywhere.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Scented waters prepared by distilling flowers like rose and keora were requisitioned to wet the roads,
streets and lanes of Dvaraka-dhama. Such places, along with the marketplace and public meeting places,
were thoroughly cleansed. From the above description, it appears that the city of Dvarakadhama was
considerably big, containing many highways, streets and public meeting places with parks, gardens and
reservoirs of water, all very nicely decorated with flowers and fruits. And to welcome the Lord such
flowers and fruits with unbroken seeds of grain were also strewn over the public places. Unbroken seeds
of grain or fruits in the seedling stage were considered auspicious, and they are still so used by the Hindus
in general on festival days.
