<h2>Text</h2>
sakrd yad darsitam rupam
etat kamaya te 'nagha
mat-kamah sanakaih sadhu
sarvan muncati hrc-chayan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sakrt--once only; yat--that; darsitam--shown; rupam--form; etat--this is; kamaya--for hankerings; te--
your; anagha--O virtuous one; mat--Mine; kamah--desire; sanakaih--by increasing; sadhuh--devotee;
sarvan--all; muncati--gives away; hrt-sayan--material desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O virtuous one, you have only once seen My person, and this is just to increase your desire for Me,
because the more you hanker for Me, the more you will be freed from all material desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A living being cannot be vacant of desires. He is not a dead stone. He must be working, thinking, feeling
and willing. But when he thinks, feels and wills materially, he becomes entangled, and conversely when
he thinks, feels and wills for the service of the Lord, he becomes gradually freed from all entanglement.
The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the more he acquires a
hankering for it. That is the transcendental nature of godly service. Material service has satiation, whereas
spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. One can go on increasing his hankerings for the
loving transcendental service of the Lord, and yet he will not find satiation or end. By intense service of
the Lord, one can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally. Therefore seeing the Lord means
being engaged in His service because His service and His person are identical. The sincere devotee should
go on with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to how and where it has to
be done. There was no material desire in Narada, and yet just to increase his intense desire for the Lord,
he was so advised.
