<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Krsna, Your Lordship has protected us from a poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals,
from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest and from the battle where great
generals fought. And now You have saved us from the weapon of Asvatthama.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The list of dangerous encounters is submitted herein. Devaki was once put into difficulty by her envious
brother, otherwise she was well. But Kuntidevi and her sons were put into one difficulty after another for
years and years together. They were put into trouble by Duryodhana and his party due to the kingdom,
and each and every time the sons of Kunti were saved by the Lord. Once Bhima was administered poison
in a cake, once they were put into the house made of shellac and set afire, and once Draupadi was dragged
out, and attempts were made to insult her by stripping her naked in the vicious assembly of the Kurus.
The Lord saved Draupadi by supplying an immeasurable length of cloth, and Duryodhana's party failed to
see her naked. Similarly, when they were exiled in the forest, Bhima had to fight with the man-eater
demon Hidimba Raksasa, but the Lord saved him. So it was not finished there. After all these tribulations,
there was the great Battle of Kuruksetra, and Arjuna had to meet such great generals as Drona, Bhisma
and Karna, all powerful fighters. And at last, even when everything was done away with, there was the
brahmastra released by the son of Dronacarya to kill the child within the womb of Uttara, and so the Lord
saved the only surviving descendant of the Kurus, Maharaja Pariksit.
