<h2>Translation</h2>
It was He only who loosened the hair of all the wives of the miscreants who dared open the cluster of
your Queen's hair, which had been nicely dressed and sanctified for the great Rajasuya sacrificial
ceremony. At that time she fell down at the feet of Lord Krsna with tears in her eyes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Queen Draupadi had a beautiful bunch of hair which was sanctified in the ceremonial function of
Rajasuya-yajna. But when she was lost in a bet, Duhsasana touched her glorified hair to insult her.
Draupadi then fell down at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and Lord Krsna decided that all the wives of
Duhsasana and company should have their hair loosened as a result of the Battle of Kuruksetra. Thus after
the Battle of Kuruksetra, after all the sons and grandsons of Dhrtarastra died in battle, all the wives of the
family were obliged to loosen their hair as widows. In other words, all the wives of the Kuru family
became widows because of Duhsasana's insulting a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord can tolerate
insults upon Himself by any miscreant because the father tolerates even insults from the son. But He
never tolerates insults upon His devotees. By insulting a great soul, one has to forego all the results of
pious acts and benedictions also.
