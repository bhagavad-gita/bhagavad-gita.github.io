<h2>Translation</h2>
I have killed many friends of women, and I have thus caused enmity to such an extent that it is not
possible to undo it by material welfare work.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The grhamedhis are those whose only business is to perform welfare work for the sake of material
prosperity. Such material prosperity is sometimes hampered by sinful activities, for the materialist is sure
to commit sins, even unintentionally, in the course of discharging material duties. To get relief from such
sinful reactions, the Vedas prescribe several kinds of sacrifices. It is said in the Vedas that by performing
the Asvamedha-yajna (horse sacrifice) one can get relief from even brahma-hatya (killing of a brahmana).
Yudhisthira Maharaja performed this Asvamedha-yajna, but he thinks that even by performing such
yajnas it is not possible to get relief from the great sins committed. In war either the husband or the
brother or even the father or sons go to fight. And when they are killed, a fresh enmity is created, and
thus a chain of actions and reactions increases which is not possible to be counteracted even by thousands
of Asvamedha-yajnas.
The way of work (karma) is like that. It creates one action and another reaction simultaneously and
thus increases the chain of material activities, binding the performer in material bondage. In the
Bhagavad-gita (Bg. 9.27-28) the remedy is suggested that such actions and reactions of the path of work
can be checked only when work is done on behalf of the Supreme Lord. The Battle of Kuruksetra was
actually fought by the will of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, as it is evident from His version, and only by
His will was Yudhisthira placed on the throne of Hastinapura. Therefore, factually no sin whatsoever
touched the Pandavas, who were only the order carriers of the Lord. For others, who declare war out of
personal interest, the whole responsibility lies on them.
