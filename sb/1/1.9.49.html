<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After this, the great religious King, Maharaja Yudhisthira, executed the royal power in the kingdom
strictly according to the codes and royal principles approved by his uncle and confirmed by Lord Sri
Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira was not a mere tax collector. He was always conscious of his duty as a king, which
is no less than that of a father or spiritual master. The king is to see to the welfare of the citizens from all
angles of social, political, economic and spiritual upliftment. The king must know that human life is
meant for liberating the encaged soul from the bondage of material conditions, and therefore his duty is to
see that the citizens are properly looked after to attain this highest stage of perfection.
Maharaja Yudhisthira followed these principles strictly, as will be seen from the next chapter. Not only
did he follow the principles, but he also got approval from his old uncle, who was experienced in political
affairs, and that was also confirmed by Lord Krsna, the speaker of the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita.
Maharaja Yudhisthira is the ideal monarch, and monarchy under a trained king like Maharaja
Yudhisthira is by far the most superior form of government, superior to modern republics or governments
of the people, by the people. The mass of people, especially in this age of Kali, are all born sudras,
basically lowborn, ill-trained, unfortunate and badly associated. They themselves do not know the highest
perfectional aim of life. Therefore, votes cast by them actually have no value, and thus persons elected by
such irresponsible votes cannot be responsible representatives like Maharaja Yudhisthira.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Ninth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The passing Away of Bhismadeva in the presence of Lord Krsna."
Chapter Ten
Departure of Lord Krsna for Dvaraka
