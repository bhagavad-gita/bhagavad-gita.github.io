<h2>Text</h2>
nadhayo vyadhayah klesa
daiva-bhutatma-hetavah
ajata-satrav abhavan
jantunam rajni karhicit
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--never; adhayah--anxieties; vyadhayah--diseases; klesah--trouble due to excessive heat and cold;
daiva-bhuta-atma--all due to the body, supernatural power and other living beings; hetavah--due to the
cause of; ajata-satrau--unto one who has no enemy; abhavan--happened; jantunam--of the living beings;
rajni--unto the King; karhicit--at any time.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of the King's having no enemy, the living beings were not at any time disturbed by mental
agonies, diseases, or excessive heat or cold.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To be nonviolent to human beings and to be a killer or enemy of the poor animals is Satan's philosophy.
In this age there is enmity toward poor animals, and therefore the poor creatures are always anxious. The
reaction of the poor animals is being forced on human society, and therefore there is always the strain of
cold or hot war between men, individually, collectively or nationally. At the time of Maharaja Yudhisthira,
there were no different nations, although there were different subordinate states. The whole world was
united, and the supreme head, being a trained king like Yudhisthira, kept all the inhabitants free from
anxiety, diseases and excessive heat and cold. They were not only economically well-to-do, but also
physically fit and undisturbed by supernatural power, by enmity from other living beings and by
disturbance of bodily and mental agonies. There is a proverb in Bengali that a bad king spoils the
kingdom and a bad housewife spoils the family. This truth is applicable here also. Because the King was
pious and obedient to the Lord and sages, because he was no one's enemy and because he was a
recognized agent of the Lord and therefore protected by Him, all the citizens under the King's protection
were, so to speak, directly protected by the Lord and His authorized agents. Unless one is pious and
recognized by the Lord, he cannot make others happy who are under his care. There is full cooperation
between man and God and man and nature, and this conscious cooperation between man and God and
man and nature, as exemplified by King Yudhisthira, can bring about happiness, peace and prosperity in
the world. The attitude of exploiting one another, the custom of the day, will only bring misery.
