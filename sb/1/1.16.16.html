<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit heard that out of His causeless mercy Lord Krsna [Visnu], who is universally obeyed,
rendered all kinds of service to the malleable sons of Pandu by accepting posts ranging from chariot driver
to president to messenger, friend, night watchman, etc., according to the will of the Pandavas, obeying
them like a servant and offering obeisances like one younger in years. When he heard this, Maharaja
Pariksit became overwhelmed with devotion to the lotus feet of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Krsna is everything to the unalloyed devotees like the Pandavas. The Lord was for them the
Supreme Lord, the spiritual master, the worshipable Deity, the guide, the chariot driver, the friend, the
servant, the messenger and everything they could conceive of. And thus the Lord also reciprocated the
feelings of the Pandavas. Maharaja Pariksit, as a pure devotee of the Lord, could appreciate the Lord's
transcendental reciprocation of the feelings of His devotees, and thus he himself also was overwhelmed
with the dealings of the Lord. Simply by appreciating the dealings of the Lord with His pure devotees, one
can attain salvation. The Lord's dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealings, but one
who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. The Pandavas were
so malleable to the will of the Lord that they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the
Lord, and by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord's mercy in any shape they desired.
