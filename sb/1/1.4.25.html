<h2>Translation</h2>
Out of compassion, the great sage thought it wise that this would enable men to achieve the ultimate
goal of life. Thus he compiled the great historical narration called the Mahabharata for women, laborers
and friends of the twice-born.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The friends of the twice-born families are those who are born in the families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas, or the spiritually cultured families, but who themselves are not equal to their forefathers. Such
descendants are not recognized as such, for want of purificatory achievements. The purificatory activities
begin even before the birth of a child, and the seed-giving reformatory process is called Garbhadhanasamskara.
One who has not undergone such Garbhadhana-samskara, or spiritual family planning, is not
accepted as being of an actual twice-born family. The Garbhadhana-samskara is followed by other
purificatory processes, out of which the sacred thread ceremony is one. This is performed at the time of
spiritual initiation. After this particular samskara, one is rightly called twice-born. One birth is calculated
during the seed-giving samskara, and the second birth is calculated at the time of spiritual initiation. One
who has been able to undergo such important samskaras can be called a bona fide twice-born.
If the father and the mother do not undertake the process of spiritual family planning and simply beget
children out of passion only, their children are called dvija-bandhus. These dvija-bandhus are certainly
not as intelligent as the children of the regular twice-born families. The dvija-bandhus are classified with
the sudras and the woman class, who are by nature less intelligent. The sudras and the woman class do
not have to undergo any samskara save and except the ceremony of marriage.
The less intelligent classes of men, namely women, sudras and unqualified sons of the higher castes, are
devoid of necessary qualifications to understand the purpose of the transcendental Vedas. For them the
Mahabharata was prepared. The purpose of the Mahabharata is to administer the purpose of the Vedas,
and therefore within this Mahabharata the summary Veda of Bhagavad-gita is placed. The less intelligent
are more interested in stories than in philosophy, and therefore the philosophy of the Vedas in the form of
the Bhagavad-gita is spoken by the Lord Sri Krsna. Vyasadeva and Lord Krsna are both on the
transcendental plane, and therefore they collaborated in doing good to the fallen souls of this age. The
Bhagavad-gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. It is the first book of spiritual values, as the
Upanisads are. The Vedanta philosophy is the subject matter for study by the spiritual graduates. Only the
post-graduate spiritual student can enter into the spiritual or devotional service of the Lord. It is a great
science, and the great professor is the Lord Himself in the form of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. And
persons who are empowered by Him can initiate others in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
