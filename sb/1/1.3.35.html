<h2>Text</h2>
evam janmani karmani
hy akartur ajanasya ca
varnayanti sma kavayo
veda-guhyani hrt-pateh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; janmani--birth; karmani--activities; hi--certainly; akartuh--of the inactive; ajanasya--of the
unborn; ca--and; varnayanti--describe; sma--in the past; kavayah--the learned; veda-guhyani--
undiscoverable by the Vedas; hrt-pateh--of the Lord of the heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus learned men describe the births and activities of the unborn and inactive, which is undiscoverable
even in the Vedic literatures. He is the Lord of the heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both the Lord and the living entities are essentially all spiritual. Therefore both of them are eternal, and
neither of them has birth and death. The difference is that the so-called births and disappearances of the
Lord are unlike those of the living beings. The living beings who take birth and then again accept death
are bound by the laws of material nature. But the so-called appearance and disappearance of the Lord are
not actions of material nature, but are demonstrations of the internal potency of the Lord. They are
described by the great sages for the purpose of self-realization. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita by the Lord
that His so-called birth in the material world and His activities are all transcendental. And simply by
meditation on such activities one can attain realization of Brahman and thus become liberated from
material bondage. In the srutis it is said that the birthless appears to take birth. The Supreme has nothing
to do, but because He is omnipotent, everything is performed by Him naturally, as if done automatically.
As a matter of fact, the appearance and disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His
different activities are all confidential, even to the Vedic literatures. Yet they are displayed by the Lord to
bestow mercy upon the conditioned souls. We should always take advantage of the narrations of the
activities of the Lord, which are meditations on Brahman in the most convenient and palatable form.
