<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Perfection of pure devotional service is attained when all attention is diverted towards the
transcendental loving service of the Lord. To cut off the tie of all other affections does not mean complete
negation of the finer elements, like affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living being,
whoever he may be, must have this feeling of affection for others because this is a symptom of life. The
symptoms of life, such as desire, anger, hankerings, feelings of attraction, etc., cannot be annihilated.
Only the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be negated, but in devotional service the desire is
changed only for the service of the Lord in place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection
for family, society, country, etc., consists of different phases of sense gratification. When this desire is
changed for the satisfaction of the Lord, it is called devotional service.
In the Bhagavad-gita we can see that Arjuna desired not to fight with his brothers and relations just to
satisfy his own personal desires. But when he heard the message of the Lord, Srimad Bhagavad-gita, he
changed his decision and served the Lord. And for his doing so, he became a famous devotee of the Lord,
for it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the
Lord in friendship. The fighting was there, the friendship was there, Arjuna was there, and Krsna was
there, but Arjuna became a different person by devotional service. Therefore, the prayers of Kunti also
indicate the same categorical changes in activities. Srimati Kunti wanted to serve the Lord without
diversion, and that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate goal of life. Our attention is
usually diverted to the service of something which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When
the program is changed into the service of the Lord, that is to say when the senses are purified in relation
with the service of the Lord, it is called pure unalloyed devotional service. Srimati Kuntidevi wanted that
perfection and prayed for it from the Lord.
Her affection for the Pandavas and the Vrsnis is not out of the range of devotional service because the
service of the Lord and the service of the devotees are identical. Sometimes service to the devotee is more
valuable than service to the Lord. But here the affection of Kuntidevi for the Pandavas and the Vrsnis was
due to family relation. This tie of affection in terms of material relation is the relation of maya because the
relations of the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy. Relations of the soul,
established in relation with the Supreme Soul, are factual relations. When Kuntidevi wanted to cut off the
family relation, she meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause of material
bondage, but the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom. This relation of the soul to the soul can be
established by the via medium of the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But
seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else which was unseen in the darkness.
That is the way of devotional service.
