<p></p>

uncle Vidura; kva--where; gatah--gone; suhrt--well-wisher; api--whether; mayi--unto me; akrta-prajne--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Where is my well-wisher, uncle Vidura, and mother Gandhari, who is very afflicted due to all her sons'
demise? My uncle Dhrtarastra was also very mortified due to the death of all his sons and grandsons.
Undoubtedly I am very ungrateful. Did he, therefore, take my offenses very seriously and, along with his
wife, drown himself in the Ganges?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Pandavas, especially Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna, anticipated the aftereffects of the Battle of
Kuruksetra, and therefore Arjuna declined to execute the fighting. The fight was executed by the will of
the Lord, but the effects of family aggrievement, as they had thought of it before, had come to be true.
Maharaja Yudhisthira was always conscious of the great plight of his uncle Dhrtarastra and aunt
Gandhari, and therefore he took all possible care of them in their old age and aggrieved conditions. When,
therefore, he could not find his uncle and aunt in the palace, naturally his doubts arose, and he
conjectured that they had gone down to the water of the Ganges. He thought himself ungrateful because
when the Pandavas were fatherless, Maharaja Dhrtarastra had given them all royal facilities to live, and in
return he had killed all Dhrtarastra's sons in the Battle of Kuruksetra. As a pious man, Maharaja
Yudhisthira took into account all his unavoidable misdeeds, and he never thought of the misdeeds of his
uncle and company. Dhrtarastra had suffered the effects of his own misdeeds by the will of the Lord, but
Maharaja Yudhisthira was thinking only of his own unavoidable misdeeds. That is the nature of a good
man and devotee of the Lord. A devotee never finds fault with others, but tries to find his own and thus
rectify them as far as possible.
