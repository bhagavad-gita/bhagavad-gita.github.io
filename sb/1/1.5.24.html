ta eva veda durmedhair
dharyante purusair yatha
evam cakara bhagavan
vyasah krpana-vatsalah
SYNONYMS
te--that; eva--certainly; vedah--the book of knowledge; durmedhaih--by the less intellectual; dharyante--
can assimilate; purusaih--by the man; yatha--as much as; evam--thus; cakara--edited; bhagavan--the
powerful; vyasah--the great sage of Vyasa; krpana-vatsalah--very kind to the ignorant mass.
TRANSLATION
Thus the great sage Vyasadeva, who is very kind to the ignorant masses, edited the Vedas so they might
be assimilated by less intellectual men.
PURPORT
The Veda is one, and the reasons for its divisions in many parts are explained herewith. The seed of all
knowledge, or the Veda, is not a subject matter which can easily be understood by any ordinary man.
There is a stricture that no one should try to learn the Vedas who is not a qualified brahmana. This
stricture has been wrongly interpreted in so many ways. A class of men, who claim brahminical
qualification simply by their birthright in the family of a brahmana, claim that the study of the Vedas is a
monopoly of the brahmana caste only. Another section of the people take this as an injustice to members
of other castes, who do not happen to take birth in a brahmana family. But both of them are misguided.
The Vedas are subjects which had to be explained even to Brahmaji by the Supreme Lord. Therefore the
subject matter is understood by persons with exceptional qualities of goodness. Persons who are in the
modes of passion and ignorance are unable to understand the subject matter of the Vedas. The ultimate
goal of Vedic knowledge is Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. This Personality is very rarely
understood by those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. In the Satya-yuga everyone was
situated in the mode of goodness. Gradually the mode of goodness declined during the Treta and
Dvapara-yugas, and the general mass of people became corrupt. In the present age the mode of goodness
is almost nil, and so for the general mass of people, the kindhearted, powerful sage Srila Vyasadeva
divided the Vedas in various ways so that they may be practically followed by less intelligent persons in
the modes of passion and ignorance. It is explained in the next sloka as follows.
