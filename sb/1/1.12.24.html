<h2>Text</h2>
sarva-sad-guna-mahatmye
esa krsnam anuvratah
rantideva ivodaro
yayatir iva dharmikah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarva-sat-guna-mahatmye--glorified by all godly attributes; esah--this child; krsnam--like Lord Krsna;
anuvratah--a follower in His footsteps; rantidevah--Rantideva; iva--like; udarah--in the matter of
magnanimity; yayatih--Yayati; iva--like; dharmikah--concerning religion.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This child will be almost as good as Lord Sri Krsna by following in His footsteps. In magnanimity he
will become as great as King Rantideva. And in religion he will be like Maharaja Yayati.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The last instruction of Lord Sri Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita is that one should give up everything and
should follow in the footsteps of the Lord alone. Less intelligent persons do not agree to this great
instruction of the Lord, as ill luck would have it, but one who is actually intelligent catches up this
sublime instruction and is immensely benefited. Foolish people do not know that association is the cause
of acquiring qualities. Association with fire makes an object hot, even in the material sense. Therefore,
association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes one qualified like the Lord. As we have
discussed previously, one can achieve seventy-eight percent of the godly qualities by the Lord's intimate
association. To follow the instructions of the Lord is to associate with the Lord. The Lord is not a material
object whose presence one has to feel for such association. The Lord is present everywhere and at all
times. It is quite possible to have His association simply by following His instruction because the Lord and
His instruction and the Lord and His name, fame, attributes and paraphernalia are all identical with Him,
being absolute knowledge. Maharaja Pariksit associated with the Lord even from the womb of his mother
up to the last day of his valuable life, and thus he acquired all the essential good qualities of the Lord in all
perfection.
Rantideva: An ancient king prior to the Mahabharata period, referred to by Narada Muni while
instructing Sanjaya, as mentioned in Mahabharata (Drona-parva 67). He was a great king, liberal for
hospitality and distribution of foodstuff. Even Lord Sri Krsna praised his acts of charity and hospitality.
He was blessed by the great Vasistha Muni for supplying him cold water, and thus he achieved the
heavenly planet. He used to supply fruits, roots and leaves to the rsis, and thus he was blessed by them
with fulfillment of his desires. Although a ksatriya by birth, he never ate flesh in his life. He was especially
hospitable to Vasistha Muni, and by his blessings only he attained the higher planetary residence. He is
one of those pious kings whose names are remembered in the morning and evening.
Yayati: The great emperor of the world and the original forefather of all great nations of the world who
belong to the Aryan and Indo-European stock. He is the son of Maharaja Nabusa, and he became the
emperor of the world due to his elder brother's becoming a great and liberated saintly mystic. He ruled
over the world for several thousands of years and performed many sacrifices and pious activities recorded
in history, although his early youth was very lustful and full of romantic stories. He fell in love with
Devayani, the most beloved daughter of Sukracarya. Devayani wished to marry him, but at first he refused
to accept her because of her being a daughter of a brahmana. According to sastras, a brahmana could
marry the daughter of a ksatriya but a ksatriya could not marry the daughter of a brahmana. They were
very much cautious about varna-sankara population in the world. Sukracarya amended this law of
forbidden marriage and induced Emperor Yayati to accept Devayani. Devayani had a girl friend named
Sarmistha, who also fell in love with the emperor and thus went with her friend Devayani. Sukracarya
forbade Emperor Yayati to call Sarmistha into his bedroom, but Yayati could not strictly follow his
instruction. He secretly married Sarmistha also and begot sons by her. When this was known by Devayani,
she went to her father and lodged a complaint. Yayati was much attached to Devayani, and when he went
to his father-in-law's place to call her, Sukracarya was angry with him and cursed him to become
impotent. Yayati begged his father-in-law to withdraw his curse, but the sage asked Yayati to ask
youthfulness from his sons and let them become old as the condition of his becoming potent. He had five
sons, two from Devayani and three from Sarmistha. From his five sons, namely (1) Yadu, (2) Turvasu, (3)
Druhyu, (4) Anu and (5) Puru, five famous dynasties, namely (1) the Yadu dynasty, (2) the Yavana
(Turk) dynasty, (3) the Bhoja dynasty, (4) the Mleccha dynasty (Greek) and (5) the Paurava dynasty, all
emanated to spread all over the world. He reached the heavenly planets by dint of his pious acts, but he
fell down from there because of his self-advertisement and criticizing other great souls. After his fall, his
daughter and grandson bestowed upon him their accumulated virtues, and by the help of his grandson
and friend Sibi, he was again promoted to the heavenly kingdom, becoming one of the assembly members
of Yamaraja, with whom he is staying as a devotee. He performed more than one thousand different
sacrifices, gave in charity very liberally and was a very influential king. His majestic power was felt all
over the world. His youngest son agreed to award him his youthfulness when he was troubled with lustful
desires, even for one thousand years. Finally he became detached from worldly life and returned the
youthfulness again to his son Puru. He wanted to hand over the kingdom to Puru, but his noblemen and
the subjects did not agree. But when he explained to his subjects the greatness of Puru, they agreed to
accept Puru as the King, and thus Emperor Yayati retired from family life and left home for the forest.
