<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sutah uvaca--Suta Gosvami said; evam--thus; cintayatah--while thinking of the instructions; jisnoh--of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; krsna-pada--the feet of Krsna; saroruham--resembling lotuses;
sauhardena--by deep friendship; ati-gadhena--in great intimacy; santa--pacified; asit--it so became;
vimala--without any tinge of material contamination; matih--mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: Thus being deeply absorbed in thinking of the instructions of the Lord, which were
imparted in the great intimacy of friendship, and in thinking of His lotus feet, Arjuna's mind became
pacified and free from all material contamination.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since the Lord is absolute, deep meditation upon Him is as good as yogic trance. The Lord is
nondifferent from His name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage and specific actions. Arjuna began to
think of the Lord's instructions to him on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. Only those instructions began to
eliminate the tinges of material contamination in the mind of Arjuna. The Lord is like the sun; the sun's
appearance means immediate dissipation of darkness, or ignorance, and the Lord's appearance within the
mind of the devotee can at once drive away the miserable material effects. Lord Caitanya has therefore
recommended constant chanting of the name of the Lord for protection from all contamination of the
material world. The feeling of separation from the Lord is undoubtedly painful to the devotee, but because
it is in connection with the Lord, it has a specific transcendental effect which pacifies the heart. Feelings
of separation are also sources of transcendental bliss, and they are never comparable to contaminated
material feelings of separation.
