<h2>Text</h2>
athodicim disam yatu
svair ajnata-gatir bhavan
ito 'rvak prayasah kalah
pumsam guna-vikarsanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--therefore; udicim--northern side; disam--direction; yatu--please go away; svaih--by your relatives;
ajnata--without knowledge; gatih--movements; bhavan--of yourself; itah--after this; arvak--will usher in;
prayasah--generally; kalah--time; pumsam--of men; guna--qualities; vikarsanah--diminishing.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Please, therefore, leave for the North immediately, without letting your relatives know, for soon that
time will approach which will diminish the good qualities of men.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One can compensate for a life of frustration by becoming a dhira, or leaving home for good without
communicating with relatives, and Vidura advised his eldest brother to adopt this way without delay
because very quickly the age of Kali was approaching. A conditioned soul is already degraded by the
material association, and still in the Kali-yuga the good qualities of a man will deteriorate to the lowest
standard. He was advised to leave home before Kali-yuga approached because the atmosphere which was
created by Vidura, his valuable instructions on the facts of life, would fade away due to the influence of
the age which was fast approaching. To become narottama, or a first-class human being depending
completely on the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, is not possible for any ordinary man. It is stated in Bhagavadgita
(7.28) that a person who is completely relieved of all taints of sinful acts can alone depend on the
Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. Dhrtarastra was advised by Vidura at least to
become a dhira in the beginning if it were impossible for him to become a sannyasi or a narottama.
Persistently endeavoring on the line of self-realization helps a person to rise to the conditions of a
narottama from the stage of a dhira. The dhira stage is attained after prolonged practice of the yoga
system, but by the grace of Vidura one can attain the stage immediately simply by willing to adopt the
means of the dhira stage, which is the preparatory stage for sannyasa. The sannyasa stage is the
preparatory stage of paramahamsa, or the first-grade devotee of the Lord.
