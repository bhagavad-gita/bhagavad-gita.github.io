<h2>Translation</h2>
The eighth incarnation was King Rsabha, son of King Nabhi and his wife Merudevi. In this incarnation
the Lord showed the path of perfection, which is followed by those who have fully controlled their senses
and who are honored by all orders of life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The society of human being is naturally divided into eight by orders and statuses of life--the four
divisions of occupation and four divisions of cultural advancement. The intelligent class, the
administrative class, the productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation. And
the student life, the householder's life, retired life and renounced life are the four statuses of cultural
advancement towards the path of spiritual realization. Out of these, the renounced order of life, or the
order of sannyasa, is considered the highest of all, and a sannyasi is constitutionally the spiritual master
for all the orders and divisions. In the sannyasa order also there are four stages of upliftment toward
perfection. These stages are called kuticaka, bahudaka, parivrajakacarya, and paramahamsa. The
paramahamsa stage of life is the highest stage of perfection. This order of life is respected by all others.
Maharaja Rsabha, the son of King Nabhi and Merudevi, was an incarnation of the Lord, and He instructed
His sons to follow the path of perfection by tapasya, which sanctifies one's existence and enables one to
attain the stage of spiritual happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is searching
after happiness, but no one knows where eternal and unlimited happiness is obtainable. Foolish men seek
after material sense pleasure as a substitute for real happiness, but such foolish men forget that temporary
so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the dogs and hogs. No animal, bird or
beast is bereft of this sense pleasure. In every species of life, including the human form of life, such
happiness is immensely obtainable. The human form of life, however, is not meant for such cheap
happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and unlimited happiness by spiritual realization.
This spiritual realization is obtained by tapasya, or undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and
abstinence from material pleasure. Those who have been trained for abstinence in material pleasures are
called dhira, or men undisturbed by the senses. Only these dhiras can accept the orders of sannyasa, and
they can gradually rise to the status of the paramahamsa, which is adored by all members of society. King
Rsabha propagated this mission, and at the last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily
needs, which is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish men, but to be worshiped by all.
