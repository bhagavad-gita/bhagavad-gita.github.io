<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by administering comforts at the lotus feet of the Lord, which is the most important of all
services, the queens at Dvaraka, headed by Satyabhama, induced the Lord to conquer the demigods. Thus
the queens enjoy things which are prerogatives of the wives of the controller of thunderbolts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Satyabhama: One of the principal queens of Lord Sri Krsna at Dvaraka. After killing Narakasura, Lord
Krsna visited the palace of Narakasura accompanied by Satyabhama. He went to Indraloka also with
Satyabhama, and she was received by Sacidevi, who introduced her to the mother of the demigods, Aditi.
Aditi was very much pleased with Satyabhama, and she blessed her with the benediction of permanent
youth as long as Lord Krsna remained on the earth. Aditi also took her with her to show her the special
prerogatives of the demigods in the heavenly planets. When Satyabhama saw the parijata flower, she
desired to have it in her palace at Dvaraka. After that, she came back to Dvaraka along with her husband
and expressed her willingness to have the parijata flower at her palace. Satyabhama's palace was especially
bedecked with valuable jewels, and even in the hottest season of summer the inside of the palace
remained cool, as if air-conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flags, heralding the news of
her great husband's presence there. Once, along with her husband, she met Draupadi, and she was
anxious to be instructed by Draupadi in the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupadi was
expert in this affair because she kept five husbands, the Pandavas, and all were very much pleased with
her. On receipt of Draupadi's instructions, she was very much pleased and offered her good wishes and
returned to Dvaraka. She was the daughter of Satrajit. After the departure of Lord Krsna, when Arjuna
visited Dvaraka, all the queens, including Satyabhama and Rukmini, lamented for the Lord with great
feeling. At the last stage of her life, she left for the forest to undergo severe penance.
Satyabhama instigated her husband to get the parijata flower from the heavenly planets, and the Lord
got it even by force from the demigods, as a common husband secures things to please his wife. As already
explained, the Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their orders like an ordinary
man. But because the queens accepted the high quality of devotional service, namely administering the
Lord all comforts, the Lord played the part of a faithful and complete husband. No earthly creature can
expect to have things from the heavenly kingdom, especially the parijata flowers, which are simply to be
used by the demigods. But due to their becoming the Lord's faithful wives, all of them enjoyed the special
prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other words, since the Lord is the proprietor
of everything within His creation, it is not very astonishing for the queens of Dvaraka to have any rare
thing from any part of the universe.
