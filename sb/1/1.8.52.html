<h2>Text</h2>
yatha pankena pankambhah
suraya va surakrtam
bhuta-hatyam tathaivaikam
na yajnair marstum arhati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as much as; pankena--by the mud; panka-ambhah--water mixed with mud; suraya--by wine; va--
either; surakrtam--impurity caused by the slight touch of wine; bhuta-hatyam--killing of animals; tatha--
like that; eva--certainly; ekam--one; na--never; yajnaih--by the prescribed sacrifices; marstum--to
counteract; arhati--is worthwhile.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As it is not possible to filter muddy water through mud, or purify a wine-stained pot with wine, it is not
possible to counteract the killing of men by sacrificing animals.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Asvamedha-yajnas or Gomedha-yajnas, sacrifices in which a horse or a bull is sacrificed, were not, of
course, for the purpose of killing the animals. Lord Caitanya said that such animals sacrificed on the altar
of yajna were rejuvenated and a new life was given to them. It was just to prove the efficacy of the hymns
of the Vedas. By recitation of the hymns of the Vedas in the proper way, certainly the performer gets relief
from the reactions of sins, but in case of such sacrifices improperly done under inexpert management,
surely one has to become responsible for animal sacrifice. In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy there is no
possibility of performing the yajnas perfectly for want of expert brahmanas who are able to conduct such
yajnas. Maharaja Yudhisthira therefore gives a hint to performing sacrifices in the age of Kali. In the Kaliyuga
the only sacrifice recommended is the performance of hari-nama-yajna inaugurated by Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. But one should not indulge in animal killing and counteract it by performing the
hari-nama yajna. Those who are devotees of the Lord never kill an animal for self-interest, and (as the
Lord ordered Arjuna) they do not refrain from performing the duty of a ksatriya. The whole purpose,
therefore, is served when everything is done for the will of the Lord. This is possible only for the devotees.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the First Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Prayers by Queen Kunti and Pariksit Saved."
Chapter Nine
The Passing Away of Bhismadeva in the Presence of Lord Krsna
