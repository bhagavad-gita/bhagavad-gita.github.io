<h2>Text</h2>
sarvam kala-krtam manye
bhavatam ca yad-apriyam
sapalo yad-vase loko
vayor iva ghanavalih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarvam--all this; kala-krtam--done by inevitable time; manye--I think; bhavatam ca--for you also; yat--
whatever; apriyam--detestable; sa-palah--with the rulers; yat-vase--under the control of that time; lokah--
everyone in every planet; vayoh--the wind carries; iva--as; ghana-avalih--a line of clouds.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In my opinion, this is all due to inevitable time, under whose control everyone in every planet is carried,
just as the clouds are carried by the wind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is control by time all over the space within the universe, as there is control by time all over the
planets. All the big gigantic planets, including the sun, are being controlled by the force of air, as the
clouds are carried by the force of air. Similarly, the inevitable kala, or time, controls even the action of the
air and other elements. Everything, therefore, is controlled by the supreme kala, a forceful representative
of the Lord within the material world. Thus Yudhisthira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action
of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of
the material world. Yudhisthira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is
suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer the condition of material nature. But a pious
man is faithful to the Lord, for he is guided by the bona fide brahmana and Vaisnava following the
religious principles. These three guiding principles should be the aim of life. One should not be disturbed
by the tricks of eternal time. Even the great controller of the universe, Brahmaji, is also under the control
of that time; therefore, one should not grudge being thus controlled by time despite being a true follower
of religious principles.
