<h2>Translation</h2>
O brahmanas, the incarnations of the Lord are innumerable, like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible
sources of water.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The list of incarnations of the Personality of Godhead given herein is not complete. It is only a partial
view of all the incarnations. There are many others, such as Sri Hayagriva, Hari, Hamsa, Prsnigarbha,
Vibhu, Satyasena, Vaikuntha, Sarvabhauma, Visvaksena, Dharmasetu, Sudhama, Yogesvara, Brhadbhanu
and others of the bygone ages. Sri Prahlada Maharaja said in his prayer, "My Lord, You manifest as many
incarnations as there are species of life, namely the aquatics, the vegetables, the reptiles, the birds, the
beasts, the men, the demigods, etc., just for the maintenance of the faithful and the annihilation of the
unfaithful. You advent Yourself in this way in accordance with the necessity of the different yugas. In the
Kali-yuga You have incarnated garbed as a devotee." This incarnation of the Lord in the Kali-yuga is Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. There are many other places, both in the Bhagavatam and in other scriptures, in
which the incarnation of the Lord as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is explicitly mentioned. In the Brahmasamhita
also it is said indirectly that although there are many incarnations of the Lord, such as Rama,
Nrsimha, Varaha, Matsya, Kurma and many others, the Lord Himself sometimes incarnates in person.
Lord Krsna and Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are not, therefore, incarnations, but the original source of
all other incarnations. This will be clearly explained in the next sloka. So the Lord is the inexhaustible
source for innumerable incarnations which are not always mentioned. But such incarnations are
distinguished by specific extraordinary feats which are impossible to be performed by any living being.
That is the general test to identify an incarnation of the Lord, directly and indirectly empowered. Some
incarnations mentioned above are almost plenary portions. For instance, the Kumaras are empowered
with transcendental knowledge. Sri Narada is empowered with devotional service. Maharaja Prthu is an
empowered incarnation with executive function. The Matsya incarnation is directly a plenary portion. So
the innumerable incarnations of the Lord are manifested all over the universes constantly, without
cessation, as water flows constantly from waterfalls.
