<h2>Text</h2>
yatha hy avahito vahnir
darusv ekah sva-yonisu
naneva bhati visvatma
bhutesu ca tatha puman
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as much as; hi--exactly like; avahitah--surcharged with; vahnih--fire; darusu--in wood; ekah--
one; sva-yonisu--the source of manifestation; nana iva--like different entities; bhati--illuminates; visvaatma--
the Lord as Paramatma; bhutesu--in the living entities; ca--and; tatha--in the same way; puman--the
Absolute Person.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, as Supersoul, pervades all things, just as fire permeates wood, and so He appears to be of
many varieties, though He is the absolute one without a second.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by one of His plenary parts expands Himself all
over the material world, and His existence can be perceived even within the atomic energy. Matter,
antimatter, proton, neutron, etc., are all different effects of the Paramatma feature of the Lord. As from
wood, fire can be manifested, or as butter can be churned out of milk, so also the presence of the Lord as
Paramatma can be felt by the process of legitimate hearing and chanting of the transcendental subjects
which are especially treated in the Vedic literatures like the Upanisads and Vedanta. Srimad-Bhagavatam
is the bona fide explanation of these Vedic literatures. The Lord can be realized through the aural
reception of the transcendental message, and that is the only way to experience the transcendental
subject. As fire is kindled from wood by another fire, the divine consciousness of man can similarly be
kindled by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can kindle the spiritual fire from
the woodlike living entity by imparting proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear.
Therefore one is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ears only, and thus
divine existence is gradually realized. The difference between animality and humanity lies in this process
only. A human being can hear properly, whereas an animal cannot.
