<h2>Translation</h2>
Laksmiji, the goddess of fortune, whose glance of grace was sought by demigods like Brahma and for
whom they surrendered many a day unto the Personality of Godhead, gave up her own abode in the forest
of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. I was endowed with
specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the
impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod and lotus flower, which are signs of the lotus
feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any manmade
planning. When the Lord Sri Krsna was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of
His lotus feet were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole earth was made as
perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the
supplying agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties.
Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all other planets in the three planetary
systems of the universe. One should, therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth
so that we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all necessities of life. One may
ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this
earth for His own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The Lord, being
omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By His omnipresence, He can always be with us
if we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.
There is nothing in the world with which the Lord is disconnected. The only thing we must learn is to
excavate the source of connection and thus be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be
connected with Him by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of the Lord
and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy name of the Lord in an offenseless
manner can at once realize that the Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we
can partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of transcendence we can verily feel the
presence of the Lord. In this age, when everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed
in the scriptures and preached by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that by chanting the holy name of the
Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go
back to Godhead. The offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the Lord
Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the world can at once change the
troublesome face of the world. Only by the propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can
we be immune from all effects of the age of Kali.
