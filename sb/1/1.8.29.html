<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, no one can understand Your transcendental pastimes, which appear to be human and are so
misleading. You have no specific object of favor, nor do You have any object of envy. People only imagine
that You are partial.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord's mercy upon the fallen souls is equally distributed. He has no one as the specific object of
hostility. The very conception of the Personality of Godhead as a human being is misleading. His pastimes
appear to be exactly like a human being's, but actually they are transcendental and without any tinge of
material contamination. He is undoubtedly known as partial to His pure devotees, but in fact He is never
partial, as much as the sun is never partial to anyone. By utilizing the sun rays, sometimes even the stones
become valuable, whereas a blind man cannot see the sun, although there are enough sun rays before him.
Darkness and light are two opposite conceptions, but this does not mean that the sun is partial in
distributing its rays. The sun rays are open to everyone, but the capacities of the receptacles differ. Foolish
people think that devotional service is flattering the Lord to get special mercy. Factually the pure devotees
who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are not a mercantile community. A
mercantile house renders service to someone in exchange for values. The pure devotee does not render
service unto the Lord for such exchange, and therefore the full mercy of the Lord is open for him.
Suffering and needy men, inquisitive persons or philosophers make temporary connections with the Lord
to serve a particular purpose. When the purpose is served, there is no more relation with the Lord. A
suffering man, if he is pious at all, prays to the Lord for his recovery. But as soon as the recovery is over,
in most cases the suffering man no longer cares to keep any connection with the Lord. The mercy of the
Lord is open for him, but he is reluctant to receive it. That is the difference between a pure devotee and a
mixed devotee. Those who are completely against the service of the Lord are considered to be in abject
darkness, those who ask for the Lord's favor only at the time of necessity are partial recipients of the
mercy of the Lord, and those who are cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord are full recipients of
the mercy of the Lord. Such partiality in receiving the Lord's mercy is relative to the recipient, and it is
not due to the partiality of the all-merciful Lord.
When the Lord descends on this material world by His all-merciful energy, He plays like a human being,
and therefore it appears that the Lord is partial to His devotees only, but that is not a fact. Despite such
apparent manifestation of partiality, His mercy is equally distributed. In the Battlefield of Kuruksetra all
persons who died in the fight before the presence of the Lord got salvation without the necessary
qualifications because death before the presence of the Lord purifies the passing soul from the effects of
all sins, and therefore the dying man gets a place somewhere in the transcendental abode. Somehow or
other if someone puts himself open in the sun rays, he is sure to get the requisite benefit both by heat and
by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is never partial. It is wrong for the people in
general to think of Him as partial.
