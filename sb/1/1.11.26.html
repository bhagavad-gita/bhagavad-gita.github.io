<h2>Text</h2>
sriyo nivaso yasyorah
pana-patram mukham drsam
bahavo loka-palanam
saranganam padambujam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sriyah--of the goddess of fortune; nivasah--residential place; yasya--one whose; urah--chest; panapatram--
the drinking pot; mukham--face; drsam--of eyes; bahavah--the arms; loka-palanam--of the
administrative demigods; saranganam--of the devotees who talk and sing of the essence or substance;
pada-ambujam--the lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's chest is the abode of the goddess of fortune. His moonlike face is the drinking vessel for eyes
which hanker after all that is beautiful. His arms are the resting places for the administrative demigods.
And His lotus feet are the refuge of pure devotees who never talk or sing of any subject except His
Lordship.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are different classes of human beings, all seeking different enjoyments from different objects.
There are persons who are seeking after the favor of the goddess of fortune, and for them the Vedic
literatures give information that the Lord is always served with all reverence by thousands and thousands
of goddesses of fortune at the cintamani-dhama,
)* the transcendental abode of the Lord where the trees are all desire trees and the buildings are made of
touchstone. The Lord Govinda is engaged there in herding the surabhi cows as His natural occupation.
These goddesses of fortune can be seen automatically if we are attracted by the bodily features of the Lord.
The impersonalists cannot observe such goddesses of fortune because of their dry speculative habit. And
those who are artists, overtaken by the beautiful creation, should better see to the beautiful face of the
Lord for complete satisfaction. The face of the Lord is the embodiment of beauty. What they call beautiful
nature is but His smile, and what they call the sweet songs of the birds are but specimens of the
whispering voice of the Lord. There are administrative demigods in charge of departmental service of
cosmic management, and there are tiny administrative gods in the state service. They are always afraid of
other competitors, but if they take shelter of the arms of the Lord, the Lord can protect them always from
the attacks of enemies. A faithful servant of the Lord engaged in the service of administration is the ideal
executive head and can well protect the interest of the people in general. Other so-called administrators
are symbols of anachronisms leading to the acute distress of the people who are governed by them. The
administrators can remain safely under the protection of the arms of the Lord. The essence of everything
is the Supreme Lord: He is called the saram. And those who sing and talk about Him are called the
sarangas, or the pure devotees. The pure devotees are always hankering after the lotus feet of the Lord.
The lotus has a kind of honey which is transcendentally relished by the devotees. They are like the bees
who are always after the honey. Srila Rupa Gosvami, the great devotee acarya of the Gaudiya-Vaisnavasampradaya,
has sung a song about this lotus honey, comparing himself to the bee: "O my Lord Krsna, I
beg to offer my prayers unto You. My mind is like the bee, and it is after some honey. Kindly, therefore,
give my bee-mind a place at Your lotus feet, which are the resources for all transcendental honey. I know
that even big demigods like Brahma do not see the rays of the nails of Your lotus feet, even though they
are engaged in deep meditation for years together. Still, O infallible one, my ambition is such, for You are
very merciful to your surrendered devotees. O Madhava, I know also that I have no genuine devotion for
the service of Your lotus feet, but because Your Lordship is inconceivably powerful, You can do what is
impossible to be done. Your lotus feet can deride even the nectar of the heavenly kingdom, and therefore I
am very much attracted by them. O supreme eternal, please, therefore, let my mind be fixed at Your lotus
feet so that eternally I may be able to relish the taste of Your transcendental service." The devotees are
satisfied with being placed at the lotus feet of the Lord and have no ambition to see His all-beautiful face
or aspire for the protection of the strong arms of the Lord. They are humble by nature, and the Lord is
always leaning towards such humble devotees.
