TRANSLATION
Life's desires should never be directed toward sense gratification. One should desire only a healthy life,
or self-preservation, since a human being is meant for inquiry about the Absolute Truth. Nothing else
should be the goal of one's works.
PURPORT
The completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed towards the fulfillment of desires in
sense gratification. In such civilization, in all spheres of life, the ultimate end is sense gratification. In
politics, social service, altruism, philanthropy and ultimately in religion or even in salvation, the very
same tint of sense gratification is ever-increasingly predominant. In the political field the leaders of men
fight with one another to fulfill their personal sense gratification. The voters adore the so-called leaders
only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters are dissatisfied in their own sense
satisfaction, they dethrone the leaders, The leaders must always disappoint the voters by not satisfying
their senses. The same is applicable in all other fields; no one is serious about the problems of life. Even
those who are on the path of salvation desire to become one with the Absolute Truth and desire to
commit spiritual suicide for sense gratification. But the Bhagavatam says that one should not live for sense
gratification. One should satisfy the senses only insomuch as required for self-preservation, and not for
sense gratification. Because the body is made of senses, which also require a certain amount of
satisfaction, there are regulative directions for satisfaction of such senses. But the senses are not meant for
unrestricted enjoyment. For example, marriage or the combination of a man with a woman is necessary
for progeny, but it is not meant for sense enjoyment. In the absence of voluntary restraint, there is
propaganda for family planning, but foolish men do not know that family planning is automatically
executed as soon as there is search after the Absolute Truth. Seekers of the Absolute Truth are never
allured by unnecessary engagements in sense gratification because the serious students seeking the
Absolute Truth are always overwhelmed with the work of researching the Truth. In every sphere of life,
therefore, the ultimate end must be seeking after the Absolute Truth, and that sort of engagement will
make one happy because he will be less engaged in varieties of sense gratification. And what that Absolute
Truth is is explained as follows.
