<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
From Him only, all our kingly opulence, good wives, lives, progeny, control over our subjects, victory
over our enemies, and future accommodations in higher planets have become possible. All this is due to
His causeless mercy upon us.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Material prosperity consists of a good wife, good home, sufficient land, good children, aristocratic
family relations, victory over competitors and, by pious work, attainment of accommodations in the
higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. These facilities are earned not only by
one's hard manual labor or by unfair means, but by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Prosperity earned by
one's personal endeavor also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Personal labor must be there in addition
to the Lord's benediction, but without the Lord's benediction no one is successful simply by personal
labor. The modernized man of Kali-yuga believes in personal endeavor and denies the benediction of the
Supreme Lord. Even a great sannyasi of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of
the Supreme Lord. But as far as Vedic sastras are concerned, as we find in the pages of Srimad-
Bhagavatam, the ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord. Maharaja
Yudhisthira admits this truth in his personal success, and it behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a
great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. If one could achieve success without the
sanction of the Lord then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Despite the most advanced
treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitioner, there is death, and even in
the most hopeless case, without medical treatment, a patient is cured astonishingly. Therefore the
conclusion is that God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happenings, good or bad. Any successful
man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved.
