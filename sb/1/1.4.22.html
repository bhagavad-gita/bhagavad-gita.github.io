TRANSLATION
In the eighteenth incarnation, the Lord appeared as King Rama. In order to perform some pleasing work
for the demigods, He exhibited superhuman powers by controlling the Indian Ocean and then killing the
atheist King Ravana, who was on the other side of the sea.
PURPORT
The Personality of Godhead Sri Rama assumed the form of a human being and appeared on the earth for
the purpose of doing some pleasing work for the demigods or the administrative personalities to maintain
the order of the universe. Sometimes great demons and atheists like Ravana and Hiranyakasipu and many
others become very famous due to advancing material civilization by the help of material science and
other activities with a spirit of challenging the established order of the Lord. For example, the attempt to
fly to other planets by material means is a challenge to the established order. The conditions of each and
every planet are different, and different classes of human beings are accommodated there for particular
purposes mentioned in the codes of the Lord. But, puffed up by tiny success in material advancement,
sometimes the godless materialists challenge the existence of God. Ravana was one of them, and he
wanted to deport ordinary men to the planet of Indra (heaven) by material means without consideration
of the necessary qualifications. He wanted a staircase to be built up directly reaching the heavenly planet
so that people might not be required to undergo the routine of pious work necessary to enter that planet.
He also wanted to perform other acts against the established rule of the Lord. He even challenged the
authority of Sri Rama, the Personality of Godhead, and kidnapped His wife, Sita. Of course Lord Rama
came to chastise this atheist, answering the prayer and desire of the demigods. He therefore took up the
challenge of Ravana, and the complete activity is the subject matter of the Ramayana. Because Lord
Ramacandra was the Personality of Godhead, He exhibited superhuman activities which no human being,
including the materially advanced Ravana, could perform. Lord Ramacandra prepared a royal road on the
Indian Ocean with stones that floated on the water. The modern scientists have done research in the area
of weightlessness, but it is not possible to bring in weightlessness anywhere and everywhere. But because
weightlessness is the creation of the Lord by which He can make the gigantic planets fly and float in the
air, He made the stones even within this earth to be weightless and prepared a stone bridge on the sea
without any supporting pillar. That is the display of the power of God.
