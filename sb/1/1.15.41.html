<h2>Text</h2>
vacam juhava manasi
tat prana itare ca tam
mrtyav apanam sotsargam
tam pancatve hy ajohavit
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vacam--speeches; juhava--relinquished; manasi--into the mind; tat prane--mind into breathing; itare ca--
other senses also; tam--into that; mrtyau--into death; apanam--breathing; sa-utsargam--with all
dedication; tam--that; pancatve--into the body made of five elements; hi--certainly; ajohavit--amalgamated
it.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Then he amalgamated all the sense organs into the mind, then the mind into life, life into breathing, his
total existence into the embodiment of the five elements, and his body into death. Then, as pure self, he
became free from the material conception of life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira, like his brother Arjuna, began to concentrate and gradually became freed from all
material bondage. First he concentrated all the actions of the senses and amalgamated them into the mind,
or in other words he turned his mind toward the transcendental service of the Lord. He prayed that since
all material activities are performed by the mind in terms of actions and reactions of the material senses,
and since he was going back to Godhead, the mind would wind up its material activities and be turned
towards the transcendental service to the Lord. There was no longer a need for material activities. Actually
the activities of the mind cannot be stopped, for they are the reflection of the eternal soul, but the quality
of the activities can be changed from matter to the transcendental service of the Lord. The material color
of the mind is changed when one washes it from contaminations of life-breathing and thereby frees it
from the contamination of repeated births and deaths and situates it in pure spiritual life. All is manifested
by the temporary embodiment of the material body, which is a production of the mind at the time of
death, and if the mind is purified by practice of transcendental loving service to the Lord and is constantly
engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is no more chance of the mind's producing
another material body after death. It will be freed from absorption in material contamination. The pure
soul will be able to return home, back to Godhead.
