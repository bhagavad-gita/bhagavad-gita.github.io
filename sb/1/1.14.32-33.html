<h2>Translation</h2>
Also, Srutadeva, Uddhava and others, Nanda, Sunanda and other leaders of liberated souls who are
constant companions of the Lord are protected by Lord Balarama and Krsna. Are they all doing well in
their respective functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us, remember our
welfare?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The constant companions of Lord Krsna, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended
along with Lord Krsna to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The Pandavas are also
liberated souls who descended along with Lord Krsna to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this
earth. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (4.8), the Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated
souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all, but His
associates, although liberated souls, forget due to their being tatastha sakti, or marginal potency of the
Lord. That is the difference between the visnu-tattva and jiva-tattva. The jiva-tattvas are infinitesimal
potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to
the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The liberated souls
never, therefore, think themselves as free as the Lord or as powerful as the Lord, but they always seek the
protection of the Lord in all circumstances, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This
dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are
able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. Independently the glow of the
sparks is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there. Thus those who give up the
protection of the Lord and become so-called lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again
to this material world, even after prolonged tapasya of the severest type. That is the verdict of all Vedic
literature.
