TRANSLATION
O brahmanas, the opulence of the King was so enchanting that the denizens of heaven aspired for it. But
because he was absorbed in the service of the Lord, nothing could satisfy him except the Lord's service.
PURPORT
There are two things in the world which can satisfy living beings. When one is materially engrossed, he
is satisfied only by sense gratification, but when one is liberated from the conditions of the material
modes, he is satisfied only by rendering loving service for the satisfaction of the Lord.This means that the
living being is constitutionally a servitor, and not one who is served. Being illusioned by the conditions of
the external energy, one falsely thinks himself to be the served, but actually he is not served; he is servant
of the senses like lust, desire, anger, avarice, pride, madness and intolerance. When one is in his proper
senses by attainment of spiritual knowledge, he realizes that he is not the master of the material world,
but is only a servant of the senses. At that time he begs for the service of the Lord and thus becomes
happy without being illusioned by so-called material happiness. Maharaja Yudhisthira was one of the
liberated souls, and therefore for him there was no pleasure in a vast kingdom, good wife, obedient
brothers, happy subjects and prosperous world. These blessings automatically follow for a pure devotee,
even though the devotee does not aspire for them. The example set herein is exactly suitable. It is said
that one who is hungry is never satisfied by anything other than food.
The whole material world is full of hungry living beings. The hunger is not for good food, shelter or
sense gratification. The hunger is for the spiritual atmosphere. Due to ignorance only they think that the
world is dissatisfied because there is not sufficient food, shelter, defense and objects of sense gratification.
This is called illusion. When the living being is hungry for spiritual satisfaction, he is misrepresented by
material hunger. But the foolish leaders cannot see that even the people who are most sumptuously
materially satisfied are still hungry. And what is their hunger and poverty? This hunger is actually for
spiritual food, spiritual shelter, spiritual defense and spiritual sense gratification. These can be obtained in
the association of the Supreme Spirit, Lord Sri Krsna, and therefore one who has them cannot be attracted
by the so-called food, shelter, defense and sense gratification of the material world, even if they are
relished by the denizens of the heavenly planets. Therefore, in the Bhagavad-gita (8.16) it is said by the
Lord that even in the topmost planet of the universe, namely the Brahmaloka, where the duration of life is
multiplied by millions of years by earth calculation, one cannot satisfy his hunger. Such hunger can be
satisfied only when the living being is situated in immortality, which is attained in the spiritual sky, far,
far above the Brahmaloka, in the association of Lord Mukunda, the Lord who awards His devotees the
transcendental pleasure of liberation.
