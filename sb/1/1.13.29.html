<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus Maharaja Dhrtarastra, the scion of the family of Ajamidha, firmly convinced by introspective
knowledge [prajna], broke at once the strong network of familial affection by his resolute determination.
Thus he immediately left home to set out on the path of liberation, as directed by his younger brother
Vidura.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the great preacher of the principles of Srimad-Bhagavatam, has stressed
the importance of association with sadhus, pure devotees of the Lord. He said that even by a moments
association with a pure devotee, one can achieve all perfection. We are not ashamed to admit that this fact
was experienced in our practical life. Were we not favored by His Divine Grace Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta
Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, by our first meeting for a few minutes only, it would have been impossible
for us to accept this mighty task of describing Srimad-Bhagavatam in English. Without seeing him at that
opportune moment, we could have become a very great business magnate, but never would we have been
able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under instructions of
His Divine Grace. And here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with
Dhrtarastra. Maharaja Dhrtarastra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politics,
economy and family attachment, and he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his
planned projects, but he was frustrated from the beginning to the end so far as his material activities were
concerned. And yet, despite his life of failure, he achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by
the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lord, who is the typical emblem of a sadhu. The
scriptures enjoin, therefore, that one should associate with sadhus only, rejecting all other kinds of
association, and by doing so one will have ample opportunity to hear the sadhus, who can cut to pieces
the bonds of illusory affection in the material world. It is a fact that the material world is a great illusion
because everything appears to be a tangible reality but at the next moment evaporates like the dashing
foam of the sea or a cloud in the sky. A cloud in the sky undoubtedly appears to be a reality because it
rains, and due to rains so many temporary green things appear, but in the ultimate issue, everything
disappears, namely the cloud, rain and green vegetation, all in due course. But the sky remains, and the
varieties of sky or luminaries also remain forever. Similarly, the Absolute Truth, which is compared to the
sky, remains eternally, and the temporary cloudlike illusion comes and goes away. Foolish living beings
are attracted by the temporary cloud, but intelligent men are more concerned with the eternal sky with all
its variegatedness.
