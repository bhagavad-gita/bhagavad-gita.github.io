O Krsna, those who continuously hear, chant and repeat Your transcendental activities, or take pleasure
in others' doing so, certainly see Your lotus feet, which alone can stop the repetition of birth and death.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna cannot be seen by our present conditional vision. In order to see Him, one
has to change his present vision by developing a different condition of life full of spontaneous love of
Godhead. When Sri Krsna was personally present on the face of the globe, not everyone could see Him as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Materialists like Ravana, Hiranyakasipu, Kamsa, Jarasandha and
Sisupala, were highly qualified personalities by acquisition of material assets, but they were unable to
appreciate the presence of the Lord. Therefore, even though the Lord may be present before our eyes, it is
not possible to see Him unless we have the necessary vision. This necessary qualification is developed by
the process of devotional service only, beginning with hearing about the Lord from the right sources. The
Bhagavad-gita is one of the popular literatures which are generally heard, chanted, repeated, etc., by the
people in general, but in spite of such hearing, etc., sometimes it is experienced that the performer of such
devotional service does not see the Lord eye to eye. The reason is that the first item, sravana, is very
important. If hearing is from the right sources, it acts very quickly. Generally people hear from
unauthorized persons. Such unauthorized persons may be very learned by academic qualifications, but
because they do not follow the principles of devotional service, hearing from them becomes a sheer waste
of time. Sometimes the texts are interpreted fashionably to suit their own purposes. Therefore, first one
should select a competent and bona fide speaker and then hear from him. When the hearing process is
perfect and complete, the other processes become automatically perfect in their own way.
There are different transcendental activities of the Lord, and each and every one of them is competent to
bestow the desired result, provided the hearing process is perfect. In the Bhagavatam the activities of the
Lord begin from His dealings with the Pandavas. There are many other pastimes of the Lord in connection
with His dealings with the asuras and others. And in the Tenth Canto the sublime dealings with His
conjugal associates, the gopis, as well as with His married wives at Dvaraka are mentioned. Since the Lord
is absolute, there is no difference in the transcendental nature of each and every dealing of the Lord. But
sometimes people, in an unauthorized hearing process, take more interest in hearing about His dealings
with the gopis. Such an inclination indicates the lusty feelings of the hearer, so a bona fide speaker of the
dealings of the Lord never indulges in such hearings. One must hear about the Lord from the very
beginning, as in the Srimad-Bhagavatam or any other scriptures, and that will help the hearer attain
perfection by progressive development. One should not, therefore, consider that His dealings with the
Pandavas are less important than His dealings with the gopis. We must always remember that the Lord is
always transcendental to all mundane attachment. In all the above-mentioned dealings of the Lord, He is
the hero in all circumstances, and hearing about Him or about His devotees or combatants is conducive to
spiritual life. It is said that the Vedas and Puranas, etc., are all made to revive our lost relation with Him.
Hearing of all these scriptures is essential.
