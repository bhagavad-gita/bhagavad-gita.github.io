<h2>Text</h2>
sita-visikha-hato visirna-damsah

<p></p>

pariplutah--smeared with blood; atatayinah--the great aggressor; me--my; prasabham--in an angry mood;

salvation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
May He, Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who awards salvation, be my ultimate destination.
On the battlefield He charged me, as if angry because of the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows. His shield
was scattered, and His body was smeared with blood due to the wounds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The dealings of Lord Krsna and Bhismadeva on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra are interesting because the
activities of Lord Sri Krsna appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhismadeva; but factually
all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bhismadeva, a great devotee of the Lord. The
astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy.
The Lord, being absolute, can accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. The
Supreme Lord cannot have any enemy, nor can a so-called enemy harm Him because He is ajita, or
unconquerable. But still He takes pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes
Him from a superior position, although no one can be superior to the Lord. These are some of the
transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. And those who have no information of
pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bhismadeva played the part of
a valiant warrior, and he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared
that the Lord was wounded, but factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The all-spiritual body
cannot be wounded, and a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Had it been so, Bhismadeva
would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. Had Bhismadeva
been an enemy of the Lord, Lord Krsna could have annihilated him without even moving. There was no
need to come before Bhismadeva with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee
wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee.
This is the way of exchanging transcendental rasa, or relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such
dealings both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective positions. The Lord was so
angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was moving towards Bhismadeva, but in spite of Arjuna's
checking, He proceeded towards Bhismadeva as a lover goes to a lover, without caring for hindrances.
Apparently His determination was to kill Bhismadeva, but factually it was to please him as a great devotee
of the Lord. The Lord is undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists desire
salvation from Him, and He always awards them according to their aspiration, but here Bhismadeva
aspires to see the Lord in His personal feature. All pure devotees aspire for this.
