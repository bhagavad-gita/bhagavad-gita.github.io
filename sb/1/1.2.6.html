<h2>Translation</h2>
The supreme occupation [dharma] for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional
service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted to
completely satisfy the self.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this statement, Sri Suta Gosvami answers the first question of the sages of Naimisaranya. The sages
asked him to summarize the whole range of revealed scriptures and present the most essential part so that
fallen people or the people in general might easily take it up. The Vedas prescribe two different types of
occupation for the human being. One is called the pravrtti-marga, or the path of sense enjoyment, and the
other is called the nivrtti-marga, or the path of renunciation. The path of enjoyment is inferior, and the
path of sacrifice for the supreme cause is superior. The material existence of the living being is a diseased
condition of actual life. Actual life is spiritual existence, or brahma-bhuta existence, where life is eternal,
blissful and full of knowledge. Material existence is temporary, illusory and full of miseries. There is no
happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries, and temporary cessation of
misery is falsely called happiness. Therefore, the path of progressive material enjoyment, which is
temporary, miserable and illusory, is inferior. But devotional service to the Supreme Lord, which leads
one to eternal, blissful and all-cognizant life, is called the superior quality of occupation. This is
sometimes polluted when mixed with the inferior quality. For example, adoption of devotional service for
material gain is certainly an obstruction to the progressive path of renunciation. Renunciation or
abnegation for ultimate good is certainly a better occupation than enjoyment in the diseased condition of
life. Such enjoyment only aggravates the symptoms of disease and increases its duration. Therefore
devotional service to the Lord must be pure in quality, i.e., without the least desire for material
enjoyment. One should, therefore, accept the superior quality of occupation in the form of the devotional
service of the Lord without any tinge of unnecessary desire, fruitive action and philosophical speculation.
This alone can lead one to perpetual solace in His service.
We have purposely denoted dharma as occupation because the root meaning of the word dharma is
"that which sustains one's existence." A living being's sustenance of existence is to coordinate his
activities with his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord Krsna. Krsna is the central pivot of living
beings, and He is the all-attractive living entity or eternal form amongst all other living beings or eternal
forms. Each and every living being has his eternal form in the spiritual existence, and Krsna is the eternal
attraction for all of them. Krsna is the complete whole, and everything else is His part and parcel. The
relation is one of the servant and the served. It is transcendental and is completely distinct from our
experience in material existence. This relation of servant and the served is the most congenial form of
intimacy. One can realize it as devotional service progresses. Everyone should engage himself in that
transcendental loving service of the Lord, even in the present conditional state of material existence. That
will gradually give one the clue to actual life and please him to complete satisfaction.
