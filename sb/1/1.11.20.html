Expert dramatists, artists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and learned speakers all gave their
respective contributions, being inspired by the superhuman pastimes of the Lord. Thus they proceeded on
and on.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that five thousand years ago the society also needed the services of the dramatists, artists,
dancers, singers, historians, genealogists, public speakers, etc. Dancers, singers and dramatic artists
mostly hailed from the sudra community, whereas the learned historians, genealogists and public speakers
hailed from the brahmana community. All of them belonged to a particular caste, and they became so
trained in their respective families. Such dramatists, dancers, singers, historians, genealogists and public
speakers would dwell on the subject of the Lord's superhuman activities in different ages and
millenniums, and not on ordinary events. Nor were they in chronological order. All the Puranas are
historical facts described only in relation with the Supreme Lord in different ages and times as well as on
different planets also. Therefore, we do not find any chronological order. The modern historians,
therefore, cannot catch up the link, and thus they unauthoritatively remark that the Puranas are all
imaginary stories only.
Even one hundred years ago in India, all dramatic performances were centered around the superhuman
activities of the Supreme Lord. The common people would be verily entertained by the performances of
dramas, and yatra parties played wonderfully on the superhuman activities of the Lord, and thus even the
illiterate agriculturist would be a participant in the knowledge of Vedic literature, despite a considerable
lack of academic qualifications. Therefore, expert players in drama, dancers, singers, speakers, etc., are
required for the spiritual enlightenment of the common man. The genealogists would give account
completely of the descendants of a particular family. Even at the present moment the guides in the
pilgrimage sites of India submit a complete account of genealogical tables before a newcomer. This
wonderful act sometimes attracts more customers to receive such important information.
