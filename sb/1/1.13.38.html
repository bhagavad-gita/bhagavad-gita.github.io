<h2>Text</h2>
athajagama bhagavan
naradah saha-tumburuh
pratyutthayabhivadyaha
sanujo 'bhyarcayan munim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--thereafter; ajagama--arrived; bhagavan--the godly personality; naradah--Narada; saha-tumburuh--
along with his tumburu (musical instrument); pratyutthaya--having gotten up from their seats;
abhivadya--offering their due obeisances; aha--said; sa-anujah--along with younger brothers;
abhyarcayan--thus while receiving in a proper mood; munim--the sage.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While Sanjaya was thus speaking, Sri Narada, the powerful devotee of the Lord, appeared on the scene
carrying his tumburu. Maharaja Yudhisthira and his brothers received him properly by getting up from
their seats and offering obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devarsi Narada is described herein as bhagavan due to his being the most confidential devotee of the
Lord. The Lord and His very confidential devotees are treated on the same level by those who are actually
engaged in the loving service of the Lord. Such confidential devotees of the Lord are very much dear to
the Lord because they travel everywhere to preach the glories of the Lord in different capacities and try
their utmost to convert the nondevotees of the Lord into devotees in order to bring them to the platform
of sanity. Actually a living being cannot be a nondevotee of the Lord because of his constitutional
position, but when one becomes a nondevotee or nonbeliever, it is to be understood that the person
concerned is not in a sound condition of life. The confidential devotees of the Lord treat such illusioned
living beings, and therefore they are most pleasing in the eyes of the Lord. The Lord says in the Bhagavadgita
that no one is dearer to Him than one who actually preaches the glories of the Lord to convert the
nonbelievers and nondevotees. Such personalities as Narada must be offered all due respects, like those
offered to the Personality of Godhead Himself, and Maharaja Yudhisthira, along with his noble brothers,
were examples for others in receiving a pure devotee of the Lord like Narada, who had no other business
save and except singing the glories of the Lord along with his vina, a musical stringed instrument.
