<h2>Text</h2>
rupam bhagavato yat tan
manah-kantam sucapaham
apasyan sahasottasthe
vaiklavyad durmana iva
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rupam--form; bhagavatah--of the Personality of Godhead; yat--as it is; tat--that; manah--of the mind;
kantam--as it desires; suca-apaham--vanishing all disparity; apasyan--without seeing; sahasa--all of a
sudden; uttasthe--got up; vaiklavyat--being perturbed; durmanah--having lost the desirable; iva--as it
were.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The transcendental form of the Lord, as it is, satisfies the mind's desire and at once erases all mental
incongruities. Upon losing that form, I suddenly got up, being perturbed, as is usual when one loses that
which is desirable.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That the Lord is not formless is experienced by Narada Muni. But His form is completely different from
all forms of our material experience. For the whole duration of our life we go see different forms in the
material world, but none of them is just apt to satisfy the mind, nor can any one of them vanish all
perturbance of the mind. These are the special features of the transcendental form of the Lord, and one
who has once seen that form is not satisfied with anything else; no form in the material world can any
longer satisfy the seer. That the Lord is formless or impersonal means that He has nothing like a material
form and is not like any material personality.
As spiritual beings, having eternal relations with that transcendental form of the Lord, we are, life after
life, searching after that form of the Lord, and we are not satisfied by any other form of material
appeasement. Narada Muni got a glimpse of this, but having not seen it again he became perturbed and
stood up all of a sudden to search it out. What we desire life after life was obtained by Narada Muni, and
losing sight of Him again was certainly a great shock for him.
