<h2>Text</h2>
yudhisthiro labdha-rajyo
drstva pautram kulan-dharam
bhratrbhir loka-palabhair
mumude paraya sriya
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yudhisthirah--Yudhisthira; labdha-rajyah--possessing his paternal kingdom; drstva--by seeing;
pautram--the grandson; kulam-dharam--just suitable for the dynasty; bhratrbhih--by the brothers; lokapalabhaih--
who were all expert administrators; mumude--enjoyed life; paraya--uncommon; sriya--
opulence.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having won his kingdom and observed the birth of one grandson competent to continue the noble
tradition of his family, Maharaja Yudhisthira reigned peacefully and enjoyed uncommon opulence in
cooperation with his younger brothers, who were all expert administrators to the common people.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Both Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna were unhappy from the beginning of the Battle of Kuruksetra,
but even though they were unwilling to kill their own men in the fight, it had to be done as a matter of
duty, for it was planned by the supreme will of Lord Sri Krsna. After the battle, Maharaja Yudhisthira was
unhappy over such mass killings. Practically there was none to continue the Kuru dynasty after them, the
Pandavas. The only remaining hope was the child in the womb of his daughter-in-law, Uttara, and he was
also attacked by Asvatthama, but by the grace of the Lord the child was saved. So after the settlement of
all disturbing conditions and reestablishment of the peaceful order of the state, and after seeing the
surviving child, Pariksit, well satisfied, Maharaja Yudhisthira felt some relief as a human being, although
he had very little attraction for material happiness, which is always illusory and temporary.
