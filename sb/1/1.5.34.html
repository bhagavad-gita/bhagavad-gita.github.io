<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus when all a man's activities are dedicated to the service of the Lord, those very activities which
caused his perpetual bondage become the destroyer of the tree of work.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Fruitive work which has perpetually engaged the living being is compared to the banyan tree in the
Bhagavad-gita, for it is certainly very deeply rooted. As long as the propensity for enjoying the fruit of
work is there, one has to continue the transmigration of the soul from one body or place to another,
according to one's nature of work. The propensity for enjoyment may be turned into the desire for serving
the mission of the Lord, By doing so, one's activity is changed into karma-yoga, or the way by which one
can attain spiritual perfection while engaging in the work for which he has a natural tendency. Here the
word atma indicates the categories of all fruitive work. The conclusion is that when the result of all
fruitive and other work is dovetailed with the service of the Lord, it will cease to generate further karma
and will gradually develop into transcendental devotional service, which will not only cut off completely
the root of the banyan tree of work but will also carry the performer to the lotus feet of the Lord.
The summary is that one has to, first of all, seek the association of pure devotees who not only are
learned in the Vedanta but are self-realized souls and unalloyed devotees of Lord Sri Krsna, the
Personality of Godhead. In that association, the neophyte devotees must render loving service physically
and mentally without reservation. This service attitude will induce the great souls to be more favorable in
bestowing their mercy, which injects the neophyte with all the transcendental qualities of the pure
devotees. Gradually this is developed into a strong attachment to hearing the transcendental pastimes of
the Lord, which makes him able to catch up the constitutional position of the gross and subtle bodies and
beyond them the knowledge of pure soul and his eternal relation with the Supreme Soul, the Personality
of Godhead. After the relation is ascertained by establishment of the eternal relation, pure devotional
service to the Lord begins gradually developing into perfect knowledge of the Personality of Godhead
beyond the purview of impersonal Brahman and localized Paramatma. By such purusottama-yoga, as it is
stated in the Bhagavad-gita, one is made perfect even during the present corporeal existence, and one
exhibits all the good qualities of the Lord to the highest percentage. Such is the gradual development by
association of pure devotees.
