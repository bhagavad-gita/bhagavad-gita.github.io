<h2>Translation</h2>
We shall all wait here until the foremost devotee of the Lord, Maharaja Pariksit, returns to the supreme
planet, which is completely free from all mundane contamination and all kinds of lamentation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Beyond the limitation of the material creation, which is compared to the cloud in the sky, there is the
paravyoma, or the spiritual sky, full of planets called Vaikunthas. Such Vaikuntha planets are also
differently known as the Purusottamaloka, Acyutaloka, Trivikramaloka, Hrsikesaloka, Kesavaloka,
Aniruddhaloka, Madhavaloka, Pradyumnaloka, Sankarsanaloka, Sridharaloka, Vasudevaloka,
Ayodhyaloka, Dvarakaloka and many other millions of spiritual lokas wherein the Personality of Godhead
predominates; all the living entities there are liberated souls with spiritual bodies as good as that of the
Lord. There is no material contamination; everything there is spiritual, and therefore there is nothing
objectively lamentable. They are full of transcendental bliss, and are without birth, death, old age and
disease. And amongst all the above-mentioned Vaikunthalokas, there is one supreme loka called Goloka
Vrndavana, which is the abode of the Lord Sri Krsna and His specific associates. Maharaja Pariksit was
destined to achieve this particular loka, and the great rsis assembled there could foresee this. All of them
consulted among themselves about the great departure of the great King, and they wanted to see him up
to the last moment because they would no more be able to see such a great devotee of the Lord. When a
great devotee of the Lord passes away, there is nothing to be lamented because the devotee is destined to
enter into the kingdom of God. But the sorry plight is that such great devotees leave our sight, and
therefore there is every reason to be sorry. As the Lord is rarely to be seen by our present eyes, so also are
the great devotees. The great rsis, therefore, correctly decided to remain on the spot till the last moment.
