TRANSLATION
While performing duties according to the order of Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one
constantly remembers Him, His names and His qualities.
PURPORT
An expert devotee of the Lord can mold his life in such a way that while performing all kinds of duties
either for this or the next life, he can constantly remember the Lord's name, fame, qualities, etc. The order
of the Lord is distinctly there in the Bhagavad-gita: one should work only for the Lord in all spheres of
life. In every sphere of life the Lord should be situated as the proprietor. According to the Vedic rites,
even in the worship of some demigods like Indra, Brahma, Sarasvati and Ganesa, the system is that in all
circumstances the representation of Visnu must be there as yajnesvara, or the controlling power of such
sacrifices. It is recommended that a particular demigod be worshiped for a particular purpose, but still the
presence of Visnu is compulsory in order to make the function proper.
Apart from such Vedic duties, even in our ordinary dealings (for example, in our household affairs or in
our business or profession) we must consider that the result of all activities must be given over to the
supreme enjoyer, Lord Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord has declared Himself to be the supreme
enjoyer of everything, the supreme proprietor of every planet and the supreme friend of all beings. No one
else but Lord Sri Krsna can claim to be the proprietor of everything within His creation. A pure devotee
remembers this constantly, and in doing so he repeats the transcendental name, fame and qualities of the
Lord, which means that he is constantly in touch with the Lord. The Lord is identical with His name,
fame, etc., and therefore to be associated with His name, fame, etc., constantly, means actually to associate
with the Lord.
The major portion of our monetary income, not less than fifty percent, must be spent to carry out the
order of Lord Krsna. Not only should we give the profit of our earning to this cause, but we must also
arrange to preach this cult of devotion to others because that is also one of the orders of the Lord. The
Lord definitely says that no one is more dear to Him than one who is always engaged in the preaching
work of the Lord's name and fame all over the world. The scientific discoveries of the material world can
also be equally engaged in carrying out His order. He wants the message of the Bhagavad-gita to be
preached amongst His devotees. It may not be so done amongst those who have no credit of austerities,
charity, education, etc. Therefore, the attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to become His
devotees. Lord Caitanya has taught a very simple method in this connection. He has taught the lesson for
preaching the transcendental message through singing, dancing and refreshment. As such, fifty percent of
our income may be spent for this purpose. In this fallen age of quarrel and dissension, if only the leading
and wealthy persons of society agree to spend fifty percent of their income in the service of the Lord, as it
is taught by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, there is absolute certainty of converting this hell of
pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the Lord. No one will disagree to partake in a function
where good singing, dancing and refreshment are administered. Everyone will attend such a function, and
everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental presence of the Lord. This alone will help the
attendant associate with the Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The only condition
for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be conducted under the guidance of a
pure devotee who is completely free from all mundane desires, fruitive activities and dry speculations
about the nature of the Lord. No one has to discover the nature of the Lord. It is already spoken by the
Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gita especially and in all other Vedic literatures generally. We have simply
to accept them in toto and abide by the orders of the Lord. That will guide us to the path of perfection.
One can remain in his own position. No one has to change his position, especially in this age of variegated
difficulties. The only condition is that one must give up the habit of dry speculation aimed at becoming
one with the Lord. And after giving up such lofty puffed-up vanities, one may very submissively receive
the orders of the Lord in the Bhagavad-gita or Bhagavatam from the lips of a bona fide devotee whose
qualification is mentioned above. That will make everything successful, without a doubt.
