<h2>Text</h2>
bhaktyavesya mano yasmin
vaca yan-nama kirtayan
tyajan kalevaram yogi
mucyate kama-karmabhih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhaktya--with devout attention; avesya--meditating; manah--mind; yasmin--in whose; vaca--by words;
yat--Krsna; nama--holy name; kirtayan--by chanting; tyajan--quitting; kalevaram--this material body;
yogi--the devotee; mucyate--gets release; kama-karmabhih--from fruitive activities.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, who appears in the mind of the devotee by attentive devotion and
meditation and by chanting of the holy name, releases the devotee from the bondage of fruitive activities
at the time of his quitting the material body.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Yoga means concentration of the mind detached from all other subject matter. And actually such
concentration is samadhi, or cent percent engagement in the service of the Lord. And one who
concentrates his attention in that manner is called a yogi. Such a yogi devotee of the Lord engages himself
twenty-four hours daily in the service of the Lord so that his whole attention is engrossed with the
thoughts of the Lord in ninefold devotional service, namely hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping,
praying, becoming a voluntary servant, carrying out orders, establishing a friendly relationship, or
offering all that one may possess, in the service of the Lord. By such practice of yoga, or linking up in the
service of the Lord, one is recognized by the Lord Himself, as it is explained in the Bhagavad-gita
concerning the highest perfectional stage of samadhi. The Lord calls such a rare devotee the best amongst
all the yogis Such a perfect yogi is enabled by the divine grace of the Lord to concentrate his mind upon
the Lord with a perfect sense of consciousness, and thus by chanting His holy name before quitting the
body the yogi is at once transferred by the internal energy of the Lord to one of the eternal planets where
there is no question of material life and its concomitant factors. In material existence a living being has to
endure the material conditions of threefold miseries, life after life, according to his fruitive work. Such
material life is produced by material desires only. Devotional service to the Lord does not kill the natural
desires of the living being, but they are applied in the right cause of devotional service. This qualifies the
desire to be transferred to the spiritual sky. General Bhismadeva is referring to a particular type of yoga
called bhakti-yoga, and he was fortunate enough to have the Lord directly in his presence before he
quitted his material body. He therefore desired that the Lord stay before his view in the following verses.
