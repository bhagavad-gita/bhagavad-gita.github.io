<h2>Text</h2>
vettha tvam saumya tat sarvam
tattvatas tad-anugrahat
bruyuh snigdhasya sisyasya
guravo guhyam apy uta
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vettha--you are well conversant; tvam--Your Honor; saumya--one who is pure and simple; tat--those;
sarvam--all; tattvatah--in fact; tat--their; anugrahat--by the favor of; bruyuh--will tell; snigdhasya--of the
one who is submissive; sisyasya--of the disciple; guravah--the spiritual masters; guhyam--secret; api uta--
endowed with.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
And because you are submissive, your spiritual masters have endowed you with all the favors bestowed
upon a gentle disciple. Therefore you can tell us all that you have scientifically learned from them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The secret of success in spiritual life is in satisfying the spiritual master and thereby getting his sincere
blessings. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has sung in his famous eight stanzas on the spiritual
master as follows: "I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master. Only by his
satisfaction can one please the Personality of Godhead, and when he is dissatisfied there is only havoc on
the path of spiritual realization." It is essential, therefore, that a disciple be very much obedient and
submissive to the bona fide spiritual master. Srila Suta Gosvami fulfilled all these qualifications as a
disciple, and therefore he was endowed with all favors by his learned and self-realized spiritual masters
such as Srila Vyasadeva and others. The sages of Naimisaranya were confident that Srila Suta Gosvami was
bona fide. Therefore they were anxious to hear from him.
