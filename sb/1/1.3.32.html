<h2>Text</h2>
atah param yad avyaktam
avyudha-guna-brmhitam
adrstasruta-vastutvat
sa jivo yat punar-bhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atah--this; param--beyond; yat--which; avyaktam--unmanifested; avyudha--without formal shape; gunabrmhitam--
affected by the qualities; adrsta--unseen; asruta--unheard; vastutvat--being like that; sah--that;
jivah--living being; yat--that which; punah-bhavah--takes birth repeatedly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Beyond this gross conception of form is another, subtle conception of form which is without formal
shape and is unseen, unheard and unmanifest. The living being has his form beyond this subtlety,
otherwise he could not have repeated births.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As the gross cosmic manifestation is conceived as the gigantic body of the Lord, so also there is the
conception of His subtle form, which is simply realized without being seen, heard or manifested. But in
fact all these gross or subtle conceptions of the body are in relation with the living beings. The living
being has his spiritual form beyond this gross material or subtle psychic existence. The gross body and
psychic functions cease to act as soon as the living being leaves the visible gross body. In fact, we say that
the living being has gone away because he is unseen and unheard. Even when the gross body is not acting
when the living being is in sound sleep, we know that he is within the body by his breathing. So the living
being's passing away from the body does not mean that there is no existence of the living soul. It is there,
otherwise how can he repeat his births again and again?
The conclusion is that the Lord is eternally existent in His transcendental form, which is neither gross
nor subtle like that of the living being; His body is never to be compared to the gross and subtle bodies of
the living being. All such conceptions of God's body are imaginary. The living being has his eternal
spiritual form, which is conditioned only by his material contamination.
