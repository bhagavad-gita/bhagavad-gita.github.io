<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear boy, the Lord, who carries the wheel of a chariot, is represented by the monarchical regime,
and when this regime is abolished the whole world becomes filled with thieves, who then at once
vanquish the unprotected subjects like scattered lambs.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Srimad-Bhagavatam the monarchical regime represents the Supreme Lord, the Personality
of Godhead. The king is said to be the representative of the Absolute Personality of Godhead because he is
trained to acquire the qualities of God to protect the living beings. The Battle of Kuruksetra was planned
by the Lord to establish the real representative of the Lord, Maharaja Yudhisthira. An ideal king
thoroughly trained by culture and devotional service with the martial spirit makes a perfect king. Such a
personal monarchy is far better than the so-called democracy of no training and responsibility. The
thieves and rogues of modern democracy seek election by misrepresentation of votes, and the successful
rogues and thieves devour the mass of population. One trained monarch is far better than hundreds of
useless ministerial rogues, and it is hinted herein that by abolition of a monarchical regime like that of
Maharaja Pariksit, the mass of people become open to many attacks of the age of Kali. They are never
happy in an overly advertised form of democracy. The result of such a kingless administration is described
in the following verses.
