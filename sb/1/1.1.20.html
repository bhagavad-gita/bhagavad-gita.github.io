<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
krtavan kila karmani
saha ramena kesavah
atimartyani bhagavan
gudhah kapata-manusah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
krtavan--done by; kila--what; karmani--acts; saha--along with; ramena--Balarama; kesavah--Sri Krsna;
atimartyani--superhuman; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; gudhah--masked as; kapata--apparently;
manusah--human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, along with Balarama, played like a human being, and so
masked He performed many superhuman acts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to Sri Krsna, or the
Personality of Godhead. The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very
much rampant nowadays, especially in India. Since Lord Rama, Lord Krsna and Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in
revealed scriptures, many unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of
concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary business, especially in Bengal. Any popular
personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an
incarnation of Godhead by popular vote. Lord Sri Krsna was not that type of incarnation. He was actually
the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance. He appeared before His so-called
mother as four-armed Visnu. Then, at the request of the mother, He became like a human child and at
once left her for another devotee at Gokula, where He was accepted as the son of Nanda Maharaja and
Yasoda Mata. Similarly, Sri Baladeva, the counterpart of Lord Sri Krsna, was also considered a human
child born of another wife of Sri Vasudeva. In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that His birth and deeds are
transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and
deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of the
transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Sri Krsna is sufficient for liberation. In the
Bhagavatam, the transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantos, and in the Tenth Canto His
specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is
important to note here, however, that the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His mother,
that His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven), and that all these acts
definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet, due to His mystic covering,
He was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other
relatives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Him, the father and mother took it otherwise.
And they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As such, the sages of Naimisaranya
describe Him as apparently resembling a human being, but actually He is the supreme almighty
Personality of Godhead.
