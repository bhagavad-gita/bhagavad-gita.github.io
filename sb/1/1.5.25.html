<h2>Text</h2>
ucchista-lepan anumodito dvijaih
sakrt sma bhunje tad-apasta-kilbisah
evam pravrttasya visuddha-cetasas
tad-dharma evatma-rucih prajayate
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ucchista-lepan--the remnants of foodstuff; anumoditah--being permitted; dvijaih--by the Vedantist
brahmanas; sakrt--once upon a time; sma--in the past; bhunje--took; tat--by that action; apasta--
eliminated; kilbisah--all sins; evam--thus; pravrttasya--being engaged; visuddha-cetasah--of one whose
mind is purified; tat--that particular; dharmah--nature; eva--certainly; atma-rucih--transcendental
attraction; prajayate--was manifested.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at
once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the
transcendentalist became attractive to me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Pure devotion is as much infectious, in a good sense, as infectious diseases. A pure devotee is cleared
from all kinds of sins. The Personality of Godhead is the purest entity, and unless one is equally pure
from the infection of material qualities, one cannot become a pure devotee of the Lord. The bhaktivedantas
as above mentioned were pure devotees, and the boy became infected with their qualities of
purity by their association and by eating once the remnants of the foodstuff taken by them. Such remnants
may be taken even without permission of the pure devotees. There are sometimes pseudodevotees, and
one should be very much cautious about them. There are many things which hinder one from entering
devotional service. But by the association of pure devotees all these obstacles are removed. The neophyte
devotee becomes practically enriched with the transcendental qualities of the pure devotee, which means
attraction for the Personality of Godhead's name, fame, quality, pastimes, etc. Infection of the qualities of
the pure devotee means to imbibe the taste of pure devotion always in the transcendental activities of the
Personality of Godhead. This transcendental taste at once makes all material things distasteful. Therefore
a pure devotee is not at all attracted by material activities. After the elimination of all sins or obstacles on
the path of devotional service, one can become attracted, one can have steadiness, one can have perfect
taste, one can have transcendental emotions, and at last one can be situated on the plane of loving service
of the Lord. All these stages develop by the association of pure devotees, and that is the purport of this
stanza.
