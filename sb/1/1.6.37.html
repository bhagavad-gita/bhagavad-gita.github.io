Suta Gosvami said: Thus addressing Vyasadeva, Srila Narada Muni took leave of him, and vibrating on
his vina instrument, he left to wander at his free will.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living being is anxious for full freedom because that is his transcendental nature. And this
freedom is obtained only through the transcendental service of the Lord. Illusioned by the external
energy, everyone thinks that he is free, but actually he is bound up by the laws of nature. A conditioned
soul cannot freely move from one place to another even on this earth, and what to speak of one planet to
another. But a full-fledged free soul like Narada, always engaged in chanting the Lord's glory, is free to
move not only on earth but also in any part of the universe, as well as in any part of the spiritual sky. We
can just imagine the extent and unlimitedness of his freedom, which is as good as that of the Supreme
Lord. There is no reason or obligation for his traveling, and no one can stop him from his free movement.
Similarly, the transcendental system of devotional service is also free. It may or may not develop in a
particular person even after he undergoes all the detailed formulas. Similarly, the association of the
devotee is also free. One may be fortunate to have it, or one may not have it even after thousands of
endeavors. Therefore, in all spheres of devotional service, freedom is the main pivot. Without freedom
there is no execution of devotional service. The freedom surrendered to the Lord does not mean that the
devotee becomes dependent in every respect. To surrender unto the Lord through the transparent
medium of the spiritual master is to attain complete freedom of life.
