<h2>Text</h2>
ko 'vrscat tava padams trin
saurabheya catus-pada
ma bhuvams tvadrsa rastre
rajnam krsnanuvartinam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kah--who is he; avrscat--cut off; tava--your; padan--legs; trin--three; saurabheya--O son of Surabhi;
catuh-pada--you are four-legged; ma--never to be; bhuvan--it so happened; tvadrsah--as yourself; rastre--
in the state; rajnam--of the kings; krsna-anuvartinam--those who follow the codes of Krsna, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He [Maharaja Pariksit] repeatedly addressed and questioned the bull thus: O son of Surabhi, who has
cut off your three legs? In the state of the kings who are obedient to the laws of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Krsna, there is no one as unhappy as you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The kings or the executive heads of all states must know the codes of Lord Krsna (generally Bhagavadgita
and Srimad-Bhagavatam) and must act accordingly in order to fulfill the mission of human life, which
is to make an end to all miseries of material conditions. One who knows the codes of Lord Krsna can
achieve this end without any difficulty. In the Bhagavad-gita, in a synopsis, we can understand the codes
of Godhead, and in the Srimad-Bhagavatam the same codes are explained further.
In a state where the codes of Krsna are followed, no one is unhappy. Where such codes are not
followed, the first sign is that three legs of the representative of religion are cut off, and thereby all
miseries follow. When Krsna was personally present, the codes of Krsna were being followed without
question, but in His absence such codes are presented in the pages of Srimad-Bhagavatam for the guidance
of the blind persons who happen to be at the helm of all affairs.
