<h2>Text</h2>
dharmasya hy apavargyasya
nartho 'rthayopakalpate
narthasya dharmaikantasya
kamo labhaya hi smrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dharmasya--occupational engagement; hi--certainly; apavargyasya--ultimate liberation; na--not; arthah--
end; arthaya--for material gain; upakalpate--is meant for; na--neither; arthasya--of material gain; dharmaeka-
antasya--for one who is engaged in the ultimate occupational service; kamah--sense gratification;
labhaya--attainment of; hi--exactly; smrtah--is described by the great sages.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation. They should never be
performed for material gain. Furthermore, according to sages, one who is engaged in the ultimate
occupational service should never use material gain to cultivate sense gratification.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have already discussed that pure devotional service to the Lord is automatically followed by perfect
knowledge and detachment from material existence. But there are others who consider that all kinds of
different occupational engagements, including those of religion, are meant for material gain. The general
tendency of any ordinary man in any part of the world is to gain some material profit in exchange for
religious or any other occupational service. Even in the Vedic literatures, for all sorts of religious
performances an allurement of material gain is offered, and most people are attracted by such allurements
or blessings of religiosity. Why are such so-called men of religion allured by material gain? Because
material gain can enable one to fulfill desires, which in turn satisfy sense gratification. This cycle of
occupational engagements includes so-called religiosity followed by material gain and material gain
followed by fulfillment of desires. Sense gratification is the general way for all sorts of fully occupied men.
But in the statement of Suta Gosvami, as per the verdict of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, this is nullified by the
present sloka.
One should not engage himself in any sort of occupational service for material gain only. Nor should
material gain be utilized for sense gratification. How material gain should be utilized is described as
follows.
