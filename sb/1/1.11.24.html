<h2>Text</h2>
raja-margam gate krsne
dvarakayah kula-striyah
harmyany aruruhur vipra
tad-iksana-mahotsavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
raja-margam--the public roads; gate--while passing over; krsne--by Lord Krsna; dvarakayah--of the city
of Dvaraka; kula-striyah--ladies of the respectable families; harmyani--on the palaces; aruruhuh--got up;
vipra--O brahmanas; tat-iksana--just to look upon Him (Krsna); maha-utsavah--accepted as the greatest
festival.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Lord Krsna passed over the public roads, all the ladies from the respectable families of Dvaraka
went up to the roofs of their palaces just to have a look at the Lord. They considered this to be the
greatest festival.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To have a look at the Lord is a great festive occasion undoubtedly, as it was considered by the
metropolitan ladies of Dvaraka. This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the
days of the Jhulana and Janmastami ceremonies, the ladies of India still throng up in the greatest number
at the temple of the Lord, where His transcendental eternal form is worshiped. The transcendental form of
the Lord installed in a temple is not different from the Lord personally. Such a form of the Lord is called
arca-vigraha, or arca incarnation, and is expanded by the Lord by His internal potency just to facilitate the
devotional service of His innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot
perceive the spiritual nature of the Lord, and therefore the Lord accepts the arca-vigraha, which is
apparently made of material elements like earth, wood and stone but actually there is no material
contamination. The Lord being kaivalya (one alone), there is no matter in Him. He is one without a
second, and therefore the Almighty Lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the
material conception. Therefore, festivities in the temple of the Lord, as held generally, are like festivals
performed during the manifestive days of the Lord of Dvaraka, about five thousand years ago. The
authorized acaryas, who know the science perfectly, install such temples of the Lord under regulative
principles just to offer facilities to the common man, but persons who are less intelligent, without being
conversant with the science, mistake this great attempt to be idol worship and poke their nose into that to
which they have no access. Therefore, the ladies or men who observe festivals in the temples of the Lord
just to have a look at the transcendental form are a thousand times more glorious than those who are
nonbelievers in the transcendental form of the Lord.
It appears from the verse that the inhabitants of Dvaraka were all owners of big palaces. This indicates
the prosperity of the city. The ladies got up on the roofs just to have a look at the procession and the
Lord. The ladies did not mix with the crowd on the street, and thus their respectability was perfectly
observed. There was no artificial equality with the man. Female respectability is preserved more elegantly
by keeping the woman separate from the man. The sexes should not mix unrestrictedly.
