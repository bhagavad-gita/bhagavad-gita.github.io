<h2>Translation</h2>
At the Rajasuya-yajna [sacrifice] performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira, there was the greatest assembly of
all the elite men of the world, the royal and learned orders, and in that great assembly Lord Sri Krsna was
worshiped by one and all as the most exalted Personality of Godhead. This happened during my presence,
and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After gaining victory in the Battle of Kuruksetra, Maharaja Yudhisthira, the Emperor of the world,
performed the Rajasuya sacrificial ceremony. The emperor, in those days, upon his ascendance to the
throne, would send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacy, and any ruling prince
or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey
the supremacy of the particular emperor. One who accepted the challenge had to fight with the emperor
and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated challenger would have to sacrifice his life,
making a place for another king or ruler. So Maharaja Yudhisthira also dispatched such challenging
horses all over the world, and every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Maharaja
Yudhisthira's leadership as the Emperor of the world. After this, all rulers of the world under the regime
of Maharaja Yudhisthira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Rajasuya. Such
performances required hundreds of millions of dollars, and it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a
sacrificial ceremony, being too expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstances, is
now impossible in this age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of
the ceremony.
So, after being invited, all the kings and great learned sages of the world assembled in the capital of
Maharaja Yudhisthira. The learned society, including the great philosophers, religionists, physicians,
scientists and all great sages, was invited. That is to say, the brahmanas and the ksatriyas were the
topmost leading men in society, and they were all invited to participate in the assembly. The vaisyas and
sudras were unimportant elements in society, and they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change of
social activities in the modern age, the importance of men has also changed in terms of occupational
positions.
So in that great assembly, Lord Sri Krsna was the cynosure of neighboring eyes. Everyone wanted to see
Lord Krsna, and everyone wanted to pay his humble respects to the Lord. Bhismadeva remembered all
this and was glad that his worshipful Lord, the Personality of Godhead, was present before him in His
actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activities, form,
pastimes, name and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the
impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the Bhagavad-gita (12.5) it is clearly stated that to meditate upon
the impersonal feature of the Supreme is very difficult. It is practically no meditation or simply a waste of
time because very seldom is the desired result obtained. The devotees, however, meditate upon the Lord's
factual form and pastimes, and therefore the Lord is easily approachable by the devotees. This is also
stated in the Bhagavad-gita (12.9). The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities. It is
indicated also in this sloka that Lord Sri Krsna, while actually present before human society, especially in
connection with the Battle of Kuruksetra, was accepted as the greatest personality of the time, although
He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The propaganda that a very
great man is worshiped as God after his death is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made
into God. Nor can the Personality of Godhead be a human being, even when He is personally present.
Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropomorphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord
Krsna.
