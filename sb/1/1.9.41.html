atha visvesa visvatman
visva-murte svakesu me
sneha-pasam imam chindhi
drdham pandusu vrsnisu
SYNONYMS
atha--therefore; visva-isa--O Lord of the universe; visva-atman--O soul of the universe; visva-murte--O
personality of the universal form; svakesu--unto my own kinsmen; me--my; sneha-pasam--tie of affection;
imam--this; chindhi--cut off; drdham--deep; pandusu--for the Pandavas; vrsnisu--for the Vrsnis also.
TRANSLATION
O Lord of the universe, soul of the universe, O personality of the form of the universe, please, therefore,
sever my tie of affection for my kinsmen, the Pandavas and the Vrsnis.
PURPORT
A pure devotee of the Lord is ashamed to ask anything in self-interest from the Lord. But the
householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors from the Lord, being bound by the tie of family
affection. Srimati Kuntidevi was conscious of this fact, and therefore she prayed to the Lord to cut off the
affectionate tie from her own kinsmen, the Pandavas and the Vrsnis. The Pandavas are her own sons, and
the Vrsnis are the members of her paternal family. Krsna was equally related to both the families. Both the
families required the Lord's help because both were dependent devotees of the Lord. Srimati Kuntidevi
wished Sri Krsna to remain with her sons the Pandavas, but by His doing so her paternal house would be
bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kunti, and therefore she desired to cut off
the affectionate tie.
A pure devotee cuts off the limited ties of affection for his family and widens his activities of devotional
service for all forgotten souls. The typical example is the band of six Gosvamis, who followed the path of
Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cultured rich families of the higher
castes, but for the benefit of the mass of population they left their comfortable homes and became
mendicants. To cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. Without doing this, no
one can be qualified as a brahmana, a king, a public leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of
Godhead, as an ideal king, showed this by example. Sri Ramacandra cut off the tie of affection for His
beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king.
Such personalities as a brahmana, a devotee, a king or a public leader must be very broadminded in
discharging their respective duties. Srimati Kuntidevi was conscious of this fact, and being weak she
prayed to be free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the Lord of the universe,
or the Lord of the universal mind, indicating His all-powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family
affection. Therefore, it is sometimes experienced that the Lord, out of His special affinity towards a weak
devotee, breaks the family affection by force of circumstances arranged by His all-powerful energy. By
doing so He causes the devotee to become completely dependent on Him and thus clears the path for his
going back to Godhead.
