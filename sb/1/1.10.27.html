<h2>Translation</h2>
Undoubtedly it is wonderful that Dvaraka has defeated the glories of the heavenly planets and has
enhanced the celebrity of the earth. The inhabitants of Dvaraka are always seeing the soul of all living
beings [Krsna] in His loving feature. He glances at them and favors them with sweet smiles.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The heavenly planets are inhabited by demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuna and Vayu and the pious
souls reach there after performance of many virtuous acts on earth. Modern scientists agree that the
timing arrangement in higher planetary systems is different from that of the earth. Thus it is understood
from the revealed scriptures that the duration of life there is ten thousand years (by our calculation). Six
months on earth is equal to one day on the heavenly planets. Facilities of enjoyment are also similarly
enhanced, and the beauty of the inhabitants is legendary. Common men on the earth are very much fond
of reaching the heavenly planets because they have heard that comforts of life are far greater there than on
the earth. They are now trying to reach the moon by spacecraft. Considering all this, the heavenly planets
are more celebrated than the earth. But the celebrity of earth has defeated that of the heavenly planets
because of Dvaraka, where Lord Sri Krsna reigned as King. Three places, namely Vrndavana, Mathura and
Dvaraka, are more important than the famous planets within the universe. These places are perpetually
sanctified because whenever the Lord descends on earth He displays His transcendental activities
particularly in these three places. They are perpetually the holy lands of the Lord, and the inhabitants still
take advantage of the holy places, even though the Lord is now out of their sight. The Lord is the soul of
all living beings, and He desires always to have all the living beings, in their svarupa, in their
constitutional position, to participate in transcendental life in His association. His attractive features and
sweet smiles go deep into the heart of everyone, and once it is so done the living being is admitted into
the kingdom of God, from which no one returns. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita.
The heavenly planets may be very famous for offering better facilities of material enjoyment, but as we
learn from the Bhagavad-gita (9.20-21), one has to come back again to the earth planet as soon as the
acquired virtue is finished. Dvaraka is certainly more important than the heavenly planets because
whoever has been favored with the smiling glance of the Lord shall never come back again to this rotten
earth, which is certified by the Lord Himself as a place of misery. Not only this earth but also all the
planets of the universes are places of misery because in none of the planets within the universe is there
eternal life, eternal bliss and eternal knowledge. Any person engaged in the devotional service of the Lord
is recommended to live in one of the above-mentioned three places, namely Dvaraka, Mathura or
Vrndavana. Because devotional service in these three places is magnified, those who go there to follow the
principles in terms of instructions imparted in the revealed scriptures surely achieve the same result as
obtained during the presence of Lord Sri Krsna. His abode and He Himself are identical, and a pure
devotee under the guidance of another experienced devotee can obtain all the results, even at present.
