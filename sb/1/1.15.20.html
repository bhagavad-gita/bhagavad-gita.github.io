<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Emperor, now I am separated from my friend and dearmost well-wisher, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and therefore my heart appears to be void of everything. In His absence I have been defeated by
a number of infidel cowherd men while I was guarding the bodies of all the wives of Krsna.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The important point in this verse is how it was possible that Arjuna could be defeated by a gang of
ignoble cowherd men and how such mundane cowherd men could touch the bodies of the wives of Lord
Krsna, who were under the protection of Arjuna. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has justified the
contradiction by research in the Visnu Purana and Brahma Purana. In these Puranas it is said that once
the fair denizens of heaven pleased Astavakra Muni by their service and were blessed by the muni to have
the Supreme Lord as their husband. Astavakra Muni was curved in eight joints of his body, and thus he
used to move in a peculiar curved manner. The daughters of the demigods could not check their laughter
upon seeing the movements of the muni, and the muni, being angry at them, cursed them that they would
be kidnapped by rogues, even if they would get the Lord as their husband. Later on, the girls again
satisfied the muni by their prayers, and the muni blessed them that they would regain their husband even
after being robbed by the rogues. So, in order to keep the words of the great muni, the Lord Himself
kidnapped His wives from the protection of Arjuna, otherwise they would have at once vanished from the
scene as soon as they were touched by the rogues. Besides that, some of the gopis who prayed to become
wives of the Lord returned to their respective positions after their desire was fulfilled. After the departure
of Lord Krsna, He wanted all His entourage back to Godhead, and they were called back under different
conditions only.
