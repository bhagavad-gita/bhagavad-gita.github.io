<h2>Translation</h2>
Wherever the King visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers, who were all
devotees of the Lord, and also of the glorious acts of Lord Krsna. He also heard how he himself had been
protected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Asvatthama. People also mentioned the
great affection between the descendants of Vrsni and Prtha due to the latter's great devotion to Lord
Kesava. The King, being very pleased with the singers of such glories, opened his eyes in great
satisfaction. Out of magnanimity he was pleased to award them very valuable necklaces and clothing.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses. This is a system from
time immemorial, and Maharaja Pariksit, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was
also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. The subject
matter of those welcome addresses was Krsna. Krsna means Krsna and His eternal devotees, as the king
means the king and his confidential associates.
Krsna and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore glorifying the devotee means
glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Maharaja Pariksit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of
his forefathers like Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna had they not been connected with the acts of Lord
Krsna. The Lord descends specifically to deliver His devotees (paritranaya sadhunam). The devotees are
glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the
Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore
Maharaja Pariksit felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially when he was
saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees of the Lord are never in danger, but in the
material world which is full of dangers at every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous
positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified. Lord Krsna would not have been
glorified as the speaker of the Bhagavad-gita had His devotees like the Pandavas not been entangled in the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the addresses of welcome, and
Maharaja Pariksit, in full satisfaction, rewarded those who presented such addresses. The difference
between the presentation of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the welcome
addresses were presented to a person like Maharaja Pariksit. The welcome addresses were full of facts and
figures, and those who presented such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days
the welcome addresses are presented not always with factual statements but to please the postholder, and
often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by
the poor receiver.
