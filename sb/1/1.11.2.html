TRANSLATION
Suta Gosvami said: Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the maintainer of the
world, became pleased after reestablishing Maharaja Yudhisthira in his own kingdom and after restoring
the Kuru dynasty, which had been exhausted by the bamboo fire of anger.
PURPORT
This world is compared to a forest fire caused by the cohesion of bamboo bushes. Such a forest fire takes
place automatically, for bamboo cohesion occurs without external cause. Similarly, in the material world
the wrath of those who want to lord it over material nature interacts, and the fire of war takes place,
exhausting the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take place, and the Lord has nothing to do with
them. But because He wants to maintain the creation, He desires the mass of people to follow the right
path of self-realization, which enables the living beings to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord wants
the suffering human beings to come back home, back to Him, and cease to suffer the threefold material
pangs. The whole plan of creation is made in that way, and one who does not come to his senses suffers in
the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord therefore wants His
bona fide representative to rule the world. Lord Sri Krsna descended to establish this sort of regime and to
kill the unwanted persons who have nothing to do with His plan. The Battle of Kuruksetra was fought
according to the plan of the Lord so that undesirable persons could get out of the world and a peaceful
kingdom under His devotee could be established. The Lord was therefore fully satisfied when King
Yudhisthira was on the throne and the seedling of the dynasty of Kuru, in the person of Maharaja Pariksit,
was saved.
