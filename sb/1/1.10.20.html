<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anyonyam--among each other; asit--there was; sanjalpah--talking; uttama-sloka--the Supreme, who is
praised by selected poetry; cetasam--of those whose hearts are absorbed in that way; kaurava-indra--the
king of the Kurus; pura--capital; strinam--all the ladies; sarva--all; sruti--the Vedas; manah-harah--
attractive to the mind.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Absorbed in the thought of the transcendental qualities of the Lord, who is glorified in select poetry, the
ladies on the roofs of all the houses of Hastinapura began to talk of Him. This talk was more attractive
than the hymns of the Vedas.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that in all the Vedic literatures the goal is the Personality of Godhead Sri
Krsna. Factually the glories of the Lord are depicted in such literature as the Vedas, Ramayana and
Mahabharata. And in the Bhagavatam they are specifically mentioned in respect to the Supreme Lord.
Therefore, while the ladies on the tops of the houses in the capital of the kings of the Kuru dynasty were
talking about the Lord, their talk was more pleasing than the Vedic hymns. Anything sung in the praise of
the Lord is Sruti-mantra. There are songs of Thakura Narottama dasa, one of the acaryas in the Gaudiyasampradaya,
composed in simple Bengali language. But Thakura Visvanatha Cakravarti, another very
learned acarya of the same sampradaya, has approved the songs by Thakura Narottama dasa to be as good
as Vedic mantras. And this is so because of the subject matter. The language is immaterial, but the subject
matter is important. The ladies, who were all absorbed in the thought and actions of the Lord, developed
the consciousness of Vedic wisdom by the grace of the Lord. And therefore although such ladies might
not have been very learned scholars in Sanskrit or otherwise, still whatever they spoke was more attractive
than the Vedic hymns. The Vedic hymns in the Upanisads are sometimes indirectly directed to the
Supreme Lord. But the talks of the ladies were directly spoken of the Lord, and thus they were more
pleasing to the heart. The ladies' talks appeared to be more valuable than the learned brahmanas'
benedictions.
