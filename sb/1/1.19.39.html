<h2>Text</h2>
nunam bhagavato brahman
grhesu grha-medhinam
na laksyate hy avasthanam
api go-dohanam kvacit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nunam--because; bhagavatah--of you, who are powerful; brahman--O brahmana; grhesu--in the houses;
grha-medhinam--of the householders; na--not; laksyate--are seen; hi--exactly; avasthanam--staying in;
api--even; go-dohanam--milking the cow; kvacit--rarely.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O powerful brahmana, it is said that you hardly stay in the houses of men long enough to milk a cow.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Saints and sages in the renounced order of life go to the houses of the householders at the time they
milk the cows, early in the morning, and ask some quantity of milk for subsistence. A pound of milk fresh
from the milk bag of a cow is sufficient to feed an adult with all vitamin values, and therefore saints and
sages live only on milk. Even the poorest of the householders keep at least ten cows, each delivering
twelve to twenty quarts of milk, and therefore no one hesitates to spare a few pounds of milk for the
mendicants. It is the duty of householders to maintain the saints and sages, like the children. So a saint
like Sukadeva Gosvami would hardly stay at the house of a householder for more than five minutes in the
morning. In other words, such saints are very rarely seen in the houses of householders, and Maharaja
Pariksit therefore prayed to him to instruct him as soon as possible. The householders also should be
intelligent enough to get some transcendental information from visiting sages. The householder should
not foolishly ask a saint to deliver what is available in the market. That should be the reciprocal relation
between the saints and the householders.
