<h2>Translation</h2>
It was by His mercy only that my enemies neglected to kill me when I descended from my chariot to get
water for my thirsty horses. And it was due to my lack of esteem for my Lord that I dared engage Him as
my chariot driver, for He is worshiped and offered services by the best men to attain salvation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, is the object of worship both by
impersonalists and by the devotees of the Lord. The impersonalists worship His glowing effulgence,
emanating from His transcendental body of eternal form, bliss and knowledge, and the devotees worship
Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are below even the impersonalists consider Him
to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lord, however, descends to attract all by His specific
transcendental pastimes, and thus He plays the part of the most perfect master, friend, son and lover. His
transcendental relation with Arjuna was in friendship, and the Lord therefore played the part perfectly, as
He did with His parents, lovers and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relation, the
devotee forgets, by the internal potency of the Lord, that his friend or son is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, although sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the Lord. After the departure of the
Lord, Arjuna was conscious of his great friend, but there was no mistake on the part of Arjuna, nor any ill
estimation of the Lord. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the Lord with a pure,
unalloyed devotee like Arjuna.
In the warfield, scarcity of water is a well-known fact. Water is very rare there, and both the animals and
men, working strenuously on the warfield, constantly require water to quench their thirst. Especially
wounded soldiers and generals feel very thirsty at the time of death, and it sometimes so happens that
simply for want of water one has to die unavoidably. But such scarcity of water was solved in the Battle of
Kuruksetra by means of boring the ground. By God's grace, water can be easily obtained from any place if
there is facility for boring the ground. The modern system works on the same principle of boring the
ground, but modern engineers are still unable to dig immediately wherever necessary. It appears,
however, from the history as far back as the days of the Pandavas, that big generals like Arjuna could at
once supply water even to the horses, and what to speak of men, by drawing water from underneath the
hard ground simply by penetrating the stratum with a sharp arrow, a method still unknown to the
modern scientists.
