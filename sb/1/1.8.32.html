kecid ahur ajam jatam

yadoh priyasyanvavaye
malayasyeva candanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kecit--someone; ahuh--says; ajam--the unborn; jatam--being born; punya-slokasya--of the great pious
king; kirtaye--for glorifying; yadoh--of King Yadu; priyasya--of the dear; anvavaye--in the family of;
malayasya--Malaya hills; iva--as; candanam--sandalwood.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Some say that the Unborn is born for the glorification of pious kings, and others say that He is born to
please King Yadu, one of Your dearest devotees. You appear in his family as sandalwood appears in the
Malaya hills.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because the Lord's appearance in this material world is bewildering, there are different opinions about
the birth of the Unborn. In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He takes His birth in the material world,
although He is the Lord of all creations and He is unborn. So there cannot be any denial of the birth of the
Unborn because He Himself establishes the truth. But still there are different opinions as to why He takes
His birth. That is also declared in the Bhagavad-gita. He appears by His own internal potency to
reestablish the principles of religion and to protect the pious and to annihilate the impious. That is the
mission of the appearance of the Unborn. Still, it is said that the Lord is there to glorify the pious King
Yudhisthira. Lord Sri Krsna certainly wanted to establish the kingdom of the Pandavas for the good of all
in the world. When there is a pious king ruling over the world, the people are happy. When the ruler is
impious, the people are unhappy. In the age of Kali in most cases the rulers are impious, and therefore the
citizens are also continuously unhappy. But in the case of democracy, the impious citizens themselves
elect their representative to rule over them, and therefore they cannot blame anyone for their
unhappiness. Maharaja Nala was also celebrated as a great pious king, but he had no connection with
Lord Krsna. Therefore Maharaja Yudhisthira is meant here to be glorified by Lord Krsna. He had also
glorified King Yadu, having taken His birth in the family. He is known as Yadava, Yaduvira, Yadunandana,
etc., although the Lord is always independent of such obligation. He is just like the sandalwood that
grows in the Malaya hills. Trees can grow anywhere and everywhere, yet because the sandalwood trees
grow mostly in the area of the Malaya hills, the name sandalwood and the Malaya hills are interrelated.
Therefore, the conclusion is that the Lord is ever unborn like the sun, and yet He appears as the sun rises
on the eastern horizon. As the sun is never the sun of the eastern horizon, so the Lord is no one's son, but
He is the father of everything that be.
