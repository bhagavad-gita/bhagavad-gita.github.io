<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atmanam--myself; ca--also; anusocami--lamenting; bhavantam--yourself; ca--as well as; amarauttamam--
the best amongst the demigods; devan--about the demigods; pitrn--about the denizens of the
Pitrloka planet; rsin--about the sages; sadhun--about the devotees; sarvan--all of them; varnan--sections;
tatha--as also; asraman--orders of human society.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I am thinking about myself and also, O best amongst the demigods, about you, as well as about all the
demigods, sages, denizens of Pitrloka, devotees of the Lord and all men obedient to the system of varna
and asrama in human society.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To effect the perfection of human life there is cooperation between men and demigods, sages, denizens
of the Pitrloka, devotees of the Lord and the scientific system of varna and asrama orders of life. The
distinction between human life and animal life therefore begins with the scientific system of varna and
asrama, guided by the experience of the sages in relation with the demigods, gradually rising to the
summit of reestablishing our eternal relation with the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of
Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna. When God-made varnasrama-dharma, which is strictly meant for developing
animal consciousness into human consciousness and human consciousness into godly consciousness, is
broken by advancement of foolishness, the whole system of peaceful and progressive life is at once
disturbed. In the age of Kali, the first attack of the venomous snake strikes against the God-made
varnasrama-dharma, and thus a person properly qualified as a brahmana is called a sudra, and a sudra by
qualification is passing as a brahmana, all on a false birthright claim. To become a brahmana by a
birthright claim is not at all bona fide, although it may be a fulfillment of one of the conditions. But the
real qualification of a brahmana is to control the mind and the senses, and to cultivate tolerance,
simplicity, cleanliness, knowledge, truthfulness, devotion and faith in the Vedic wisdom. In the present
age, consideration of the necessary qualification is being neglected, and the false birthright claim is being
supported even by a popular, sophisticated poet, the author of Rama-carita-manasa.
This is all due to the influence of the age of Kali. Thus mother earth, represented as a cow, was
lamenting the regrettable condition.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Laksmiji, the goddess of fortune, whose glance of grace was sought by demigods like Brahma and for
whom they surrendered many a day unto the Personality of Godhead, gave up her own abode in the forest
of lotus flowers and engaged herself in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. I was endowed with
specific powers to supersede the fortune of all the three planetary systems by being decorated with the
impressions of the flag, thunderbolt, elephant-driving rod and lotus flower, which are signs of the lotus
feet of the Lord. But at the end, when I felt I was so fortunate, the Lord left me.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The beauty and opulence of the world can be enhanced by the grace of the Lord and not by any manmade
planning. When the Lord Sri Krsna was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of
His lotus feet were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole earth was made as
perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the
supplying agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties.
Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all other planets in the three planetary
systems of the universe. One should, therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth
so that we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all necessities of life. One may
ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this
earth for His own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The Lord, being
omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By His omnipresence, He can always be with us
if we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.
There is nothing in the world with which the Lord is disconnected. The only thing we must learn is to
excavate the source of connection and thus be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be
connected with Him by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of the Lord
and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy name of the Lord in an offenseless
manner can at once realize that the Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we
can partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of transcendence we can verily feel the
presence of the Lord. In this age, when everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed
in the scriptures and preached by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that by chanting the holy name of the
Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go
back to Godhead. The offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the Lord
Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the world can at once change the
troublesome face of the world. Only by the propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can
we be immune from all effects of the age of Kali.
