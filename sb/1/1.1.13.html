<h2>Text</h2>
tan nah susrusamananam
arhasy anganuvarnitum
yasyavataro bhutanam
ksemaya ca bhavaya ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--those; nah--unto us; susrusamananam--those who are endeavoring for; arhasi--ought to do it; anga--
O Suta Gosvami; anuvarnitum--to explain by following in the footsteps of previous acaryas; yasya--whose;
avatarah--incarnation; bhutanam--of the living beings; ksemaya--for good; ca--and; bhavaya--upliftment;
ca--and.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Suta Gosvami, we are eager to learn about the Personality of Godhead and His incarnations. Please
explain to us those teachings imparted by previous masters [acaryas], for one is uplifted both by speaking
them and by hearing them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conditions for hearing the transcendental message of the Absolute Truth are set forth herein. The
first condition is that the audience must be very sincere and eager to hear. And the speaker must be in the
line of disciplic succession from the recognized acarya. The transcendental message of the Absolute is not
understandable by those who are materially absorbed. Under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master,
one becomes gradually purified. Therefore, one must be in the chain of disciplic succession and learn the
spiritual art of submissive hearing. In the case of Suta Gosvami and the sages of Naimisaranya, all these
conditions are fulfilled because Srila Suta Gosvami is in the line of Srila Vyasadeva, and the sages of
Naimisaranya are all sincere souls who are anxious to learn the truth. Thus the transcendental topics of
Lord Sri Krsna's superhuman activities, His incarnation, His birth, appearance or disappearance, His
forms, His names and so on are all easily understandable because all requirements are fulfilled. Such
discourses help all men on the path of spiritual realization.
