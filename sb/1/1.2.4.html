<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
narayanam namaskrtya
naram caiva narottamam
devim sarasvatim vyasam
tato jayam udirayet
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
narayanam--the Personality of Godhead; namah-krtya--after offering respectful obeisances; naram ca
eva--and Narayana Rsi; nara-uttamam--the supermost human being; devim--the goddess; sarasvatim--the
mistress of learning; vyasam--Vyasadeva; tatah--thereafter; jayam--all that is meant for conquering;
udirayet--be announced.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Before reciting this Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is the very means of conquest, one should offer
respectful obeisances unto the Personality of Godhead, Narayana, unto Nara-narayana Rsi, the supermost
human being, unto mother Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, and unto Srila Vyasadeva, the author.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All the Vedic literatures and the Puranas are meant for conquering the darkest region of material
existence. The living being is in the state of forgetfulness of his relation with God due to his being overly
attracted to material sense gratification from time immemorial. His struggle for existence in the material
world is perpetual, and it is not possible for him to get out of it by making plans. If he at all wants to
conquer this perpetual struggle for existence, he must reestablish his eternal relation with God. And one
who wants to adopt such remedial measures must take shelter of literatures such as the Vedas and the
Puranas. Foolish people say that the Puranas have no connection with the Vedas. However, the Puranas
are supplementary explanations of the Vedas intended for different types of men. All men are not equal.
There are men who are conducted by the mode of goodness, others who are under the mode of passion
and others who are under the mode of ignorance. The Puranas are so divided that any class of men can
take advantage of them and gradually regain their lost position and get out of the hard struggle for
existence. Srila Suta Gosvami shows the way of chanting the Puranas. This may be followed by persons
who aspire to be preachers of the Vedic literatures and the Puranas. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the spotless
Purana, and it is especially meant for those who desire to get out of the material entanglement
permanently.
