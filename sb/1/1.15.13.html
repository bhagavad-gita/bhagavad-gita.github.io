<h2>Translation</h2>
When I stayed for some days as a guest in the heavenly planets, all the heavenly demigods, including
King Indradeva, took shelter of my arms, which were marked with the Gandiva bow, to kill the demon
named Nivatakavaca. O King, descendant of Ajamidha, at the present moment I am bereft of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, by whose influence I was so powerful.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The heavenly demigods are certainly more intelligent, powerful and beautiful, and yet they had to take
help from Arjuna because of his Gandiva bow, which was empowered by the grace of Lord Sri Krsna. The
Lord is all-powerful, and by His grace His pure devotee can be as powerful as He may desire, and there is
no limit to it. And when the Lord withdraws His power from anyone, he is powerless by the will of the
Lord.
