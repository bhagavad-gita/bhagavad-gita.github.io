TRANSLATION
O friends, just think of His wives, whose hands He has accepted. How they must have undergone vows,
baths, fire sacrifices and perfect worship of the Lord of the universe to constantly relish now the nectar
from His lips [by kissing]. The damsels of Vrajabhumi would often faint just by expecting such favors.
PURPORT
Religious rites prescribed in the scriptures are meant to purify the mundane qualities of the conditioned
souls to enable them to be gradually promoted to the stage of rendering transcendental service unto the
Supreme Lord. Attainment of this stage of pure spiritual life is the highest perfection, and this stage is
called svarupa, or the factual identity of the living being. Liberation means renovation of this stage of
svarupa. In that perfect stage of svarupa, the living being is established in five phases of loving service,
one of which is the stage of madhurya-rasa, or the humor of conjugal love. The Lord is always perfect in
Himself, and thus He has no hankering for Himself. He, however, becomes a master, a friend, a son or a
husband to fulfill the intense love of the devotee concerned. Herein two classes of devotees of the Lord are
mentioned in the stage of conjugal love. One is svakiya, and the other is parakiya. Both of them are in
conjugal love with the Personality of Godhead Krsna. The queens at Dvaraka were svakiya, or duly
married wives, but the damsels of Vraja were young friends of the Lord while He was unmarried. The
Lord stayed at Vrndavana till the age of sixteen, and His friendly relations with the neighboring girls were
in terms of parakiya. These girls, as well as the queens, underwent severe penances by taking vows,
bathing and offering sacrifices in the fire, as prescribed in the scriptures. The rites, as they are, are not an
end in themselves, nor are fruitive action, culture of knowledge or perfection in mystic powers ends in
themselves. They are all means to attain to the highest stage of svarupa, to render constitutional
transcendental service to the Lord. Each and every living being has his individual position in one of the
above-mentioned five different kinds of reciprocating means with the Lord, and in one's pure spiritual
form of svarupa the relation becomes manifest without mundane affinity. The kissing of the Lord, either
by His wives or His young girl friends who aspired to have the Lord as their fiance, is not of any mundane
perverted quality. Had such things been mundane, a liberated soul like Sukadeva would not have taken
the trouble to relish them, nor would Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu have been inclined to participate in
those subjects after renouncing worldly life. The stage is earned after many lives of penance.
