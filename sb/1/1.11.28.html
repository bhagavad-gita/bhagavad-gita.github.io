<h2>Text</h2>
pravistas tu grham pitroh
parisvaktah sva-matrbhih
vavande sirasa sapta
devaki-pramukha muda
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
pravistah--after entering; tu--but; grham--houses; pitroh--of the father; parisvaktah--embraced; svamatrbhih--
by His own mothers; vavande--offered obeisances; sirasa--His head; sapta--seven; devaki--
Devaki; pramukha--headed by; muda--gladly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After entering the house of His father, He was embraced by the mothers present, and the Lord offered
His obeisances unto them by placing His head at their feet. The mothers were headed by Devaki [His real
mother].
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It appears that Vasudeva, the father of Lord Krsna, had completely separate residential quarters where
he lived with his eighteen wives, out of whom Srimati Devaki is the real mother of Lord Krsna. But in
spite of this, all other stepmothers were equally affectionate to Him, as will be evident from the following
verse. Lord Krsna also did not distinguish His real mother from His stepmothers, and He equally offered
His obeisances unto all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion. According to scriptures also, there
are seven mothers: (1) the real mother, (2) the wife of the spiritual master, (3) the wife of a brahmana, (4)
the wife of the king, (5) the cow, (6) the nurse, and (7) the earth. All of them are mothers. Even by this
injunction of the sastras, the stepmother, who is the wife of the father, is also as good as the mother
because the father is also one of the spiritual masters. Lord Krsna, the Lord of the universe, plays the part
of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers.
