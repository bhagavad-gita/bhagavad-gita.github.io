apapesu sva-bhrtyesu
balenapakva-buddhina
papam krtam tad bhagavan
sarvatma ksantum arhati
SYNONYMS
apapesu--unto one who is completely free from all sins; sva-bhrtyesu--unto one who is subordinate and
deserves to be protected; balena--by a child; apakva--who is immature; buddhina--by intelligence;
papam--sinful act; krtam--has been done; tat bhagavan--therefore the Personality of Godhead; sarvaatma--
who is all-pervading; ksantum--just to pardon; arhati--deserve.
TRANSLATION
Then the rsi prayed to the all-pervading Personality of Godhead to pardon his immature boy, who had
no intelligence and who committed the great sin of cursing a person who was completely free from all
sins, who was subordinate and who deserved to be protected.
PURPORT
Everyone is responsible for his own action, either pious or sinful. Rsi Samika could foresee that his son
had committed a great sin by cursing Maharaja Pariksit, who deserved to be protected by the brahmanas,
for he was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the
Lord. When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lord, it is very difficult to overcome the reaction.
The brahmanas, being at the head of the social orders, are meant to give protection to their subordinates
and not to curse them. There are occasions when a brahmana may furiously curse a subordinate ksatriya
or vaisya, etc., but in the case of Maharaja Pariksit there were no grounds, as already explained. The
foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity in being a brahmana's son, and thus he became liable to be
punished by the law of God. The Lord never forgives a person who condemns His pure devotee.
Therefore, by cursing a king the foolish Srngi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense.
Therefore the rsi could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his
sinful act. He therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lord, who alone can undo a thing
which is impossible to change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no
intelligence at all.
A question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Pariksit Maharaja be put
into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existence, then why was a
brahmana's son made responsible for this offensive act? The answer is that the offensive act was
performed by a child only so that he could be excused very easily, and thus the prayer of the father was
accepted. But if the question is raised why the brahmana community as a whole was made responsible for
allowing Kali into the world affairs, the answer is given in the Varaha Purana that the demons who acted
inimically toward the Personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord were allowed to take birth
in the families of brahmanas to take advantage of the age of Kali. The all-merciful Lord gave them a
chance to have their births in the families of pious brahmanas so that they could progress toward
salvation. But the demons, instead of utilizing the good opportunity, misused the brahminical culture due
to being puffed up by vanity in becoming brahmanas. The typical example is the son of Samika Rsi, and
all the foolish sons of brahmanas are warned hereby not to become as foolish as Srngi and be always on
guard against the demoniac qualities which they had in their previous births. The foolish boy was, of
course, excused by the Lord, but others, who may not have a father like Samika Rsi, will be put into great
difficulty if they misuse the advantages obtained by birth in a brahmana family.
