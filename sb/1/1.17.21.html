araksyamanah striya urvi balan
socasy atho purusadair ivartan
vacam devim brahma-kule kukarmany
abrahmanye raja-kule kulagryan
SYNONYMS
araksyamanah--unprotected; striyah--women; urvi--on the earth; balan--children; socasi--you are feeling
compassion; atho--as such; purusa-adaih--by men; iva--like that; artan--those who are unhappy; vacam--
vocabulary; devim--the goddess; brahma-kule--in the family of the brahmana; kukarmani--acts against the
principles of religion; abrahmanye--persons against the brahminical culture; raja-kule--in the
administrative family; kula-agryan--most of all the families (the brahmanas).
TRANSLATION
Are you feeling compunction for the unhappy women and children who are left forlorn by
unscrupulous persons? Or are you unhappy because the goddess of learning is being handled by
brahmanas addicted to acts against the principles of religion? Or are you sorry to see that the brahmanas
have taken shelter of administrative families that do not respect brahminical culture?
PURPORT
In the age of Kali, the women and the children, along with brahmanas and cows, will be grossly
neglected and left unprotected. In this age illicit connection with women will render many women and
children uncared for. Circumstantially, the women will try to become independent of the protection of
men, and marriage will be performed as a matter of formal agreement between man and woman. In most
cases, the children will not be taken care of properly. The brahmanas are traditionally intelligent men, and
thus they will be able to pick up modern education to the topmost rank, but as far as moral and religious
principles are concerned, they shall be the most fallen. Education and bad character go ill together, but
such things will run parallel. The administrative heads as a class will condemn the tenets of Vedic wisdom
and will prefer to conduct a so-called secular state, and the so-called educated brahmanas will be
purchased by such unscrupulous administrators. Even a philosopher and writer of many books on
religious principles may also accept an exalted post in a government which denies all the moral codes of
the sastras. The brahmanas are specifically restricted from accepting such service. But in this age they will
not only accept service, but they will do so even if it is of the meanest quality. These are some of the
symptoms of the Kali age which are harmful to the general welfare of human society.
