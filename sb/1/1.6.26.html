<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus I began chanting the holy name and fame of the Lord by repeated recitation, ignoring all the
formalities of the material world. Such chanting and remembering of the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord are benedictory. So doing, I traveled all over the earth, fully satisfied, humble and unenvious.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The life of a sincere devotee of the Lord is thus explained in a nutshell by Narada Muni by his personal
example. Such a devotee, after his initiation by the Lord or His bona fide representative, takes very
seriously chanting of the glories of the Lord and traveling all over the world so that others may also hear
the glories of the Lord. Such devotees have no desire for material gain. They are conducted by one single
desire: to go back to Godhead. This awaits them in due course on quitting the material body. Because they
have the highest aim of life, going back to Godhead, they are never envious of anyone, nor are they proud
of being eligible to go back to Godhead. Their only business is to chant and remember the holy name,
fame and pastimes of the Lord and, according to personal capacity, to distribute the message for others'
welfare without motive of material gain.
