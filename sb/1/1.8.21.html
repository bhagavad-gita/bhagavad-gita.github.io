<h2>Text</h2>
krsnaya vasudevaya
devaki-nandanaya ca
nanda-gopa-kumaraya
govindaya namo namah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
krsnaya--the Supreme Lord; vasudevaya--unto the son of Vasudeva; devaki-nandanaya--unto the son of
Devaki; ca--and; nanda-gopa--Nanda and the cowherd men; kumaraya--unto their son; govindaya--unto
the Personality of Godhead, who enlivens the cows and the senses; namah--respectful obeisances;
namah--obeisances.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Let me therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has become the son of Vasudeva,
the pleasure of Devaki, the boy of Nanda and the other cowherd men of Vrndavana, and the enlivener of
the cows and the senses.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord, being thus unapproachable by any material assets, out of unbounded and causeless mercy
descends on the earth as He is in order to show His special mercy upon His unalloyed devotees and to
diminish the upsurges of the demoniac persons. Queen Kunti specifically adores the incarnation or
descent of Lord Krsna above all other incarnations because in this particular incarnation He is more
approachable. In the Rama incarnation He remained a king's son from His very childhood, but in the
incarnation of Krsna, although He was the son of a king, He at once left the shelter of His real father and
mother (King Vasudeva and Queen Devaki) just after His appearance and went to the lap of Yasodamayi
to play the part of an ordinary cowherd boy in the blessed Vrajabhumi, which is very sanctified because of
His childhood pastimes. Therefore Lord Krsna is more merciful than Lord Rama. He was undoubtedly
very kind to Kunti's brother Vasudeva and the family. Had He not become the son of Vasudeva and
Devaki, Queen Kunti could not claim Him to be her nephew and thus address Krsna in parental affection.
But Nanda and Yasoda are more fortunate because they could relish the Lord's childhood pastimes, which
are more attractive than all other pastimes. There is no parallel to His childhood pastimes as exhibited at
Vrajabhumi, which are the prototypes of His eternal affairs in the original Krsnaloka described as the
cintamani-dhama in the Brahma-samhita. Lord Sri Krsna descended Himself at Vrajabhumi with all His
transcendental entourage and paraphernalia. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore confirmed that no one is
as fortunate as the residents of Vrajabhumi, and specifically the cowherd girls, who dedicated their
everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. His pastimes with Nanda and Yasoda and His pastimes with the
cowherd men and especially with the cowherd boys and the cows have caused Him to be known as
Govinda. Lord Krsna as Govinda is more inclined to the brahmanas and the cows, indicating thereby that
human prosperity depends more on these two items, namely brahminical culture and cow protection.
Lord Krsna is never satisfied where these are lacking.
