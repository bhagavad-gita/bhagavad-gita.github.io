<h2>Translation</h2>
All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions
of the Lord, but Lord Sri Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets
whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this particular stanza Lord Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, is distinguished from other
incarnations. He is counted amongst the avataras (incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the
Lord descends from His transcendental abode. Avatara means "one who descends." All the incarnations of
the Lord, including the Lord Himself, descend on the different planets of the material world as also in
different species of life to fulfill particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himself, and sometimes His
different plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions, or His differentiated portions directly or
indirectly empowered by Him, descend on this material world to execute certain specific functions.
Originally the Lord is full of all opulences, all prowess, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all
renunciation. When they are partly manifested through the plenary portions or parts of the plenary
portions, it should be noted that certain manifestations of His different powers are required for those
particular functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayed, it does not mean that the
electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same powerhouse can supply power to operate
large-scale industrial dynamos with greater volts. Similarly, the incarnations of the Lord display limited
powers because so much power is needed at that particular time.
For example, Lord Parasurama and Lord Nrsimha displayed unusual opulence by killing the disobedient
ksatriyas twenty-one times and killing the greatly powerful atheist Hiranyakasipu. Hiranyakasipu was so
powerful that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the unfavorable raising of his
eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of material existence many, many times excel the most well-todo
human beings, in duration of life, beauty, wealth, paraphernalia, and in all other respects. Still they
were afraid of Hiranyakasipu. Thus we can simply imagine how powerful Hiranyakasipu was in this
material world. But even Hiranyakasipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord Nrsimha. This
means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength of the Lord's nails. Similarly,
Jamadagnya displayed the Lord's power to kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their
respective states. The Lord's empowered incarnation Narada and plenary incarnation Varaha, as well as
indirectly empowered Lord Buddha, created faith in the mass of people. The incarnations of Rama and
Dhanvantari displayed His fame, and Balarama, Mohini and Vamana exhibited His beauty. Dattatreya,
Matsya, Kumara and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara and Narayana Rsis exhibited
His renunciation. So all the different incarnations of the Lord indirectly or directly manifested different
features, but Lord Krsna, the primeval Lord, exhibited the complete features of Godhead, and thus it is
confirmed that He is the source of all other incarnations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by
Lord Sri Krsna was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd girls. His
pastimes with the gopis are all displays of transcendental existence, bliss and knowledge, although these
are manifested apparently as sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the gopis should never
be misunderstood. The Bhagavatam relates these transcendental pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in
order to reach the position to understand the transcendental nature of Lord Krsna's pastimes with the
gopis, the Bhagavatam promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos.
According to Srila Jiva Gosvami's statement, in accordance with authoritative sources, Lord Krsna is the
source of all other incarnations. It is not that Lord Krsna has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms
of the Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord Sri Krsna, and in the Bhagavad-gita the
Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word
svayam is particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord Krsna has no other source than Himself. Although
in other places the incarnations are described as bhagavan because of their specific functions, nowhere are
they declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word svayam signifies the supremacy as
the summum bonum.
The summum bonum Krsna is one without a second. He Himself has expanded Himself in various parts,
portions and particles as svayam-rupa, svayam-prakasa, tad-ekatma, prabhava, vaibhava, vilasa, avatara,
avesa, and jivas, all provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective persons and
personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully analyzed the summum bonum
Krsna to have sixty-four principal attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only
some percentages of these attributes. But Sri Krsna is the possessor of the attributes cent percent. And His
personal expansions such as svayam-prakasa, tad-ekatma up to the categories of the avataras who are all
visnu-tattva, possess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord Siva, who is
neither avatara nor avesa nor in between them, possesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But
the jivas, or the individual living beings in different statuses of life, possess up to the limit of seventy-eight
percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material existence, the living being possesses these
attributes in very minute quantity, varying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect
of living beings is Brahma, the supreme administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight percent
of the attributes in full. All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantity, whereas human
beings possess the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a human being is to
develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being can never possess attributes
like Siva, Visnu or Lord Krsna. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent
transcendental attributes in fullness, but he can never become a God like Siva, Visnu or Krsna. He can
become a Brahma in due course. The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the
spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dhama and Mahesadhama.
The abode of Lord Krsna above all spiritual planets is called Krsnaloka or Goloka Vrndavana, and
the perfected living being, by developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullness, can
enter the planet of Krsnaloka after leaving the present material body.
