<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bhismadeva said: Let me now invest my thinking, feeling and willing, which were so long engaged in
different subjects and occupational duties, in the all-powerful Lord Sri Krsna. He is always self-satisfied,
but sometimes, being the leader of the devotees, He enjoys transcendental pleasure by descending on the
material world, although from Him only the material world is created.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because Bhismadeva was a statesman, the head of the Kuru dynasty, a great general and a leader of
ksatriyas, his mind was strewn over so many subjects, and his thinking, feeling and willing were engaged
in different matters. Now, in order to achieve pure devotional service, he wanted to invest all powers of
thinking, feeling and willing entirely in the Supreme Being, Lord Krsna. He is described herein as the
leader of the devotees and all-powerful. Although Lord Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead, He
Himself descends on earth to bestow upon His pure devotees the boon of devotional service. He descends
sometimes as Lord Krsna as He is, and sometimes as Lord Caitanya. Both are leaders of the pure devotees.
Pure devotees of the Lord have no desire other than the service of the Lord, and therefore they are called
satvata. The Lord is the chief amongst such satvatas. Bhismadeva, therefore, had no other desires. Unless
one is purified from all sorts of material desires, the Lord does not become one's leader. Desires cannot be
wiped out, but they have only to be purified. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita by the Lord Himself that
He gives His instruction from within the heart of a pure devotee who is constantly engaged in the service
of the Lord. Such instruction is given not for any material purpose but only for going back home, back to
Godhead (Bg. 10.10). For the ordinary man who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord not only
sanctions and becomes a witness of activities, but He never gives the nondevotee instructions for going
back to Godhead. That is the difference in dealings by the Lord with different living beings, both the
devotee and the nondevotee. He is leader of all the living beings, as the king of the state rules both the
prisoners and the free citizens. But His dealings are different in terms of devotee and nondevotee.
Nondevotees never care to take any instruction from the Lord, and therefore the Lord is silent in their
case, although He witnesses all their activities and awards them the necessary results, good or bad. The
devotees are above this material goodness and badness. They are progressive on the path of
transcendence, and therefore they have no desire for anything material. The devotee also knows Sri Krsna
as the original Narayana because Lord Sri Krsna, by His plenary portion, appears as the Karanodakasayi
Visnu, the original source of all material creation. The Lord also desires the association of His pure
devotees, and for them only the Lord descends on the earth and enlivens them. The Lord appears out of
His own will. He is not forced by the conditions of material nature. He is therefore described here as the
vibhu, or the almighty, for He is never conditioned by the laws of material nature.
