Now I am attracted to those instructions imparted to me by the Personality of Godhead [Govinda]
because they are impregnated with instructions for relieving the burning heart in all circumstances of time
and space.
PURPORT
Herein Arjuna refers to the instruction of the Bhagavad-gita, which was imparted to him by the Lord on
the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. The Lord left behind Him the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita not for the
benefit of Arjuna alone, but also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad-gita, being spoken by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom. It is nicely presented by the Lord
Himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the Upanisads,
Puranas and Vedanta-sutras. It is put within the study of the great historical epic Mahabharata, which was
especially prepared for the less intelligent class, namely the women, the laborers and those who are
worthless descendants of the brahmanas, ksatriyas and higher sections of the vaisyas. The problem which
arose in the heart of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavadgita.
Again, after the departure of the Lord from the vision of earthly people, when Arjuna was face to face
with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominence, he wanted again to remember the great
teachings of the Bhagavad-gita just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad-gita can be consulted in all
critical times, not only for solace from all kinds of mental agonies, but also for the way out of great
entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour.
The merciful Lord left behind Him the great teachings of the Bhagavad-gita so that one can take the
instructions of the Lord even when He is not visible to material eyesight. Material senses cannot have any
estimation of the Supreme Lord, but by His inconceivable power the Lord can incarnate Himself to the
sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matter, which is also
another form of the Lord's manifested energy. Thus the Bhagavad-gita, or any authentic scriptural sound
representation of the Lord, is also the incarnation of the Lord. There is no difference between the sound
representation of the Lord and the Lord Himself. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad-gita
as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord.
The faithful human being who is desirous of being liberated from the clutches of material existence can
very easily take advantage of the Bhagavad-gita, and with this in view, the Lord instructed Arjuna as if
Arjuna were in need of it. In the Bhagavad-gita, five important factors of knowledge have been delineated
pertaining to (1) the Supreme Lord, (2) the living being, (3) nature, (4) time and space and (5) the
process of activity. Out of these, the Supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The
difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel.
Nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of three different modes, and eternal time and unlimited
space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Activities of the living being are
different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material
nature. All these subject matters are concisely discussed in the Bhagavad-gita, and later the subject
matters are elaborated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam for further enlightenment. Out of the five subjects, the
Supreme Lord, the living entity, nature, and time and space are eternal, but the living entity, nature and
time are under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is absolute and completely independent of any
other control. The Supreme Lord is the supreme controller. The material activity of the living being is
beginningless, but it can be rectified by transferral into the spiritual quality. Thus it can cease its material
qualitative reactions. Both the Lord and the living entity are cognizant, and both have the sense of
identification, of being conscious as a living force. But the living being under the condition of material
nature, called mahat-tattva, misidentifies himself as being different from the Lord. The whole scheme of
Vedic wisdom is targeted to the aim of eradicating such a misconception and thus liberating the living
being from the illusion of material identification. When such an illusion is eradicated by knowledge and
renunciation, the living beings are responsible actors and enjoyers also. The sense of enjoyment in the
Lord is real, but such a sense in the living being is a sort of wishful desire only. This difference in
consciousness is the distinction of the two identities, namely the Lord and the living being. Otherwise
there is no difference between the Lord and the living being. The living being is therefore eternally one
and different simultaneously. The whole instruction of the Bhagavad-gita stands on this principle.
In the Bhagavad-gita the Lord and the living beings are both described as sanatana, or eternal, and the
Lord's abode, far beyond the material sky, is also described as sanatana. The living being is invited to live
in the sanatana existence of the Lord, and the process which can help a living being to approach the
Lord's abode, where the liberated activity of the soul is exhibited, is called sanatana-dharma. One cannot,
however, reach the eternal abode of the Lord without being free from the misconception of material
identification, and the Bhagavad-gita gives us the clue how to achieve this stage of perfection. The process
of being liberated from the misconception of material identification is called, in different stages, fruitive
activity, empiric philosophy and devotional service, up to transcendental realization. Such transcendental
realization is made possible by dovetailing all the above items in relation with the Lord. Prescribed duties
of the human being, as directed in the Vedas, can gradually purify the sinful mind of the conditioned soul
and raise him to the stage of knowledge. The purified stage of acquiring knowledge becomes the basis of
devotional service to the Lord. As long as one is engaged in researching the solution of the problems of
life, his knowledge is called jnana, or purified knowledge, but on realizing the actual solution of life, one
becomes situated in the devotional service of the Lord. The Bhagavad-gita begins with the problems of life
by discriminating the soul from the elements of matter and proves by all reason and argument that the
soul is indestructible in all circumstances and that the outer covering of matter, the body and the mind,
change for another term of material existence which is full of miseries. The Bhagavad-gita is therefore
meant for terminating all different types of miseries, and Arjuna took shelter of this great knowledge,
which had been imparted to him during the Kuruksetra battle.
