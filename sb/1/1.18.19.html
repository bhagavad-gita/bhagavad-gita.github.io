<h2>Text</h2>
kutah punar grnato nama tasya
mahattamaikanta-parayanasya
yo 'nanta-saktir bhagavan ananto
mahad-gunatvad yam anantam ahuh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kutah--what to say; punah--again; grnatah--one who chants; nama--holy name; tasya--His; mahat-tama--
great devotees; ekanta--exclusive; parayanasya--of one who takes shelter of; yah--He who; ananta--is the
Unlimited; saktih--potency; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; anantah--immeasurable; mahat--great;
gunatvat--on account of such attributes; yam--whom; anantam--by the name ananta; ahuh--is called.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
And what to speak of those who are under the direction of the great devotees, chanting the holy name of
the Unlimited, who has unlimited potency? The Personality of Godhead, unlimited in potency and
transcendental by attributes, is called the ananta [Unlimited].
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The dvija-bandhu, or the less intelligent, uncultured men born of higher castes, put forward many
arguments against the lower-caste men becoming brahmanas in this life. They argue that birth in a family
of sudras or less than sudras is made possible by one's previous sinful acts and that one therefore has to
complete the terms of disadvantages due to lower birth. And to answer these false logicians, Srimad-
Bhagavatam asserts that one who chants the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee
can at once get free from the disadvantages due to a lower-caste birth. A pure devotee of the Lord does not
commit any offense while chanting the holy name of the Lord. There are ten different offenses in the
chanting of the holy name of the Lord. To chant the holy name under the direction of a pure devotee is
offenseless chanting. Offenseless chanting of the holy name of the Lord is transcendental, and, therefore,
such chanting can at once purify one from the effects of all kinds of previous sins. This offenseless
chanting indicates that one has fully understood the transcendental nature of the holy name and has thus
surrendered unto the Lord. Transcendentally the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are
identical, being absolute. The holy name of the Lord is as powerful as the Lord. The Lord is the allpowerful
Personality of Godhead, and He has innumerable names, which are all nondifferent from Him
and are equally powerful also. In the last word of the Bhagavad-gita the Lord asserts that one who
surrenders fully unto Him is protected from all sins by the grace of the Lord. Since His name and He
Himself are identical, the holy name of the Lord can protect the devotee from all effects of sins. The
chanting of the holy name of the Lord can undoubtedly deliver one from the disadvantages of a lowercaste
birth. The Lord's unlimited power is extended on and on by the unlimited expansion of the devotees
and incarnations, and thus every devotee of the Lord and incarnations also can be equally surcharged with
the potency of the Lord. Since the devotee is surcharged with the potency of the Lord, even fractionally,
the disqualification due to lower birth cannot stand in the way.
