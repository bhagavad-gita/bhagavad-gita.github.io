<h2>Text</h2>
vidhuya tad ameyatma
bhagavan dharma-gub vibhuh
misato dasamasasya
tatraivantardadhe harih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vidhuya--having completely washed off; tat--that; ameyatma--the all-pervading Supersoul; bhagavan--
the Personality of Godhead; dharma-gup--the protector of righteousness; vibhuh--the Supreme; misatah--
while observing; dasamasasya--of one who is dressed by all directions; tatra eva--then and there; antah--
out of sight; dadhe--became; harih--the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While thus being observed by the child, the Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of
everyone and the protector of the righteous, who stretches in all directions and who is unlimited by time
and space, disappeared at once.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Child Pariksit was not observing a living being who is limited by time and space. There is a gulf of
difference between the Lord and the individual living being. The Lord is mentioned herein as the supreme
living being unlimited by time and space. Every living being is limited by time and space. Even though a
living being is qualitatively one with the Lord, quantitatively there is a great difference between the
Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. In the Bhagavad-gita both the living beings and the
Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading (yena sarvam idam tatam), yet there is a difference between
these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own
limited body, but the supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. A common living
being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasiveness, but the
Supreme Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead, is unlimitedly able to exert His influence over all places
and all times and over all living beings. And because He is all-pervasive, unlimited by time and space, He
can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Pariksit. He is mentioned herein as the protector
of the righteous. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteous, and he is specifically
protected by the Lord in all circumstances. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous also, for
He rectifies their sins through His external potency. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed
in the ten directions. This means dressed with garments on ten sides, up and down. He is present
everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will from everywhere and anywhere. His disappearance
from the sight of the child Pariksit does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He
was present there, and even after His disappearance He was there, although invisible to the eyes of the
child. This material covering of the effulgent firmament is also something like a womb of the mother
nature, and we are all put into the womb by the Lord, the father of all living beings. He is present
everywhere, even in this material womb of mother Durga, and those who are deserving can see the Lord.
