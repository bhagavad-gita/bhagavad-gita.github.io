TRANSLATION
O twice-born sages, by serving those devotees who are completely freed from all vice, great service is
done. By such service, one gains affinity for hearing the messages of Vasudeva.
PURPORT
The conditioned life of a living being is caused by his revolting against the Lord. There are men called
deva, or godly living beings, and there are men called asuras, or demons, who are against the authority of
the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita (Sixteenth Chapter) a vivid description of the asuras is given in
which it is said that the asuras are put into lower and lower states of ignorance life after life and so sink to
the lower animal forms and have no information of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. These
asuras are gradually rectified to God consciousness by the mercy of the Lord's liberated servitors in
different countries according to the supreme will. Such devotees of God are very confidential associates of
the Lord, and when they come to save human society from the dangers of godlessness, they are known as
the powerful incarnations of the Lord, as sons of the Lord, as servants of the Lord or as associates of the
Lord. But none of them falsely claim to be God themselves. This is a blasphemy declared by the asuras,
and the demoniac followers of such asuras also accept pretenders as God or His incarnation. In the
revealed scriptures there is definite information of the incarnation of God. No one should be accepted as
God or an incarnation of God unless he is confirmed by the revealed scriptures.
The servants of God are to be respected as God by the devotees who actually want to go back to
Godhead. Such servants of God are called mahatmas, or tirthas, and they preach according to particular
time and place. The servants of God urge people to become devotees of the Lord. They never tolerate
being called God. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was God Himself according to the indication of the revealed
scriptures, but He played the part of a devotee. People who knew Him to be God addressed Him as God,
but He used to block His ears with His hands and chant the name of Lord Visnu. He strongly protested
against being called God, although undoubtedly He was God Himself. The Lord behaves so to warn us
against unscrupulous men who take pleasure in being addressed as God.
The servants of God come to propagate God consciousness, and intelligent people should cooperate
with them in every respect. By serving the servant of God, one can please God more than by directly
serving the Lord. The Lord is more pleased when He sees that His servants are properly respected because
such servants risk everything for the service of the Lord and so are very dear to the Lord. The Lord
declares in the Bhagavad-gita (18.69) that no one is dearer to Him than one who risks everything to
preach His glory. By serving the servants of the Lord, one gradually gets the quality of such servants, and
thus one becomes qualified to hear the glories of God. The eagerness to hear about God is the first
qualification of a devotee eligible for entering the kingdom of God.
