<h2>Translation</h2>
This Sri Krsna is no other than the inconceivable, original Personality of Godhead. He is the first
Narayana, the supreme enjoyer. But He is moving amongst the descendants of King Vrsni just like one of
us and He is bewildering us with His self-created energy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Vedic system of acquiring knowledge is the deductive process. The Vedic knowledge is received
perfectly by disciplic succession from authorities. Such knowledge is never dogmatic, as ill conceived by
less intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of the father. She is the authority
for such confidential knowledge. Therefore, authority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-gita this truth is
confirmed in the Fourth Chapter (Bg. 4.2), and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from
authority. The very same system is accepted universally as truth, but only the false arguer speaks against
it. For example, modern spacecraft fly in the sky, and when scientists say that they travel to the other side
of the moon, men believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as
authorities. The authorities speak, and the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truths,
they have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a different interpretation. Each
and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledge, but foolishly they deny it. This means that
the misguided man can believe one authority, the scientist, but will reject the authority of the Vedas. The
result is that people have degenerated.
Here is an authority speaking about Sri Krsna as the original Personality of Godhead and the first
Narayana. Even such an impersonalist as Acarya Sankara has said in the beginning of his commentation
on the Bhagavad-gita that Narayana, the Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation. The
universe is one of the material creations, but Narayana is transcendental to such material paraphernalia.
Bhismadeva is one of the twelve mahajanas who know the principles of transcendental knowledge. His
confirmation of Lord Sri Krsna's being the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the
impersonalist Sankara. All other acaryas have also confirmed this statement, and thus there is no chance
of not accepting Lord Sri Krsna as the original Personality of Godhead. Bhismadeva says that He is the
first Narayana. This is also confirmed by Brahmaji in the Bhagavatam (10.14.14). Krsna is the first
Narayana. In the spiritual world (Vaikuntha) there are unlimited numbers of Narayanas, who are all the
same Personality of Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original Personality
of Godhead, Sri Krsna. The first form of the Lord Sri Krsna first expands Himself as the form of Baladeva,
and Baladeva expands in so many other forms, such as Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vasudeva,
Narayana, Purusa, Rama and Nrsimha. All these expansions are one and the same visnu-tattva, and Sri
Krsna is the original source of all the plenary expansions. He is therefore the direct Personality of
Godhead. He is the creator of the material world, and He is the predominating Deity known as Narayana
in all the Vaikuntha planets. Therefore, His movements amongst human beings is another sort of
bewilderment. The Lord therefore says in the Bhagavad-gita that foolish persons consider Him to be one
of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of His movements.
The bewilderment regarding Sri Krsna is due to the action of His twofold internal and external energies
upon the third one, called marginal energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energy, and
thus they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes by the external energy. By
internal energetic bewilderment, Sri Krsna expands Himself into unlimited numbers of Narayanas and
exchanges or accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the transcendental world.
And by His external energetic expansions, He incarnates Himself in the material world amongst the men,
animals or demigods to reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species of life.
Great authorities like Bhisma, however, escape His bewilderment by the mercy of the Lord.
