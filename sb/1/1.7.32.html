<h2>Text</h2>
prajopadravam alaksya
loka-vyatikaram ca tam
matam ca vasudevasya
sanjahararjuno dvayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
praja--the people in general; upadravam--disturbance; alaksya--having seen it; loka--the planets;
vyatikaram--destruction; ca--also; tam--that; matam ca--and the opinion; vasudevasya--of Vasudeva, Sri
Krsna; sanjahara--retracted; arjunah--Arjuna; dvayam--both the weapons.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus seeing the disturbance of the general populace and the imminent destruction of the planets,
Arjuna at once retracted both brahmastra weapons, as Lord Sri Krsna desired.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The theory that the modern atomic bomb explosions can annihilate the world is childish imagination.
First of all, the atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the world. And secondly, ultimately it all
rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord because without His will or sanction nothing can be built
up or destroyed. It is foolish also to think that natural laws are ultimately powerful. Material nature's law
works under the direction of the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita. The Lord says there that natural
laws work under His supervision. The world can be destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the
whims of tiny politicians. Lord Sri Krsna desired that the weapons released by both Drauni and Arjuna be
withdrawn, and it was carried out by Arjuna at once. Similarly, there are many agents of the all-powerful
Lord, and by His will only can one execute what He desires.
