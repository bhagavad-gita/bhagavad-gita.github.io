<h2>Text</h2>
yada mukundo bhagavan imam mahim
jahau sva-tanva sravaniya-sat-kathah
tadahar evapratibuddha-cetasam
abhadra-hetuh kalir anvavartata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; mukundah--Lord Krsna; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; imam--this; mahim--earth;
jahau--left; sva-tanva--with His selfsame body; sravaniya-sat-kathah--hearing about Him is worthwhile;
tada--at that time; ahah eva--from the very day; aprati-buddha-cetasam--of those whose minds are not
sufficiently developed; abhadra-hetuh--cause of all ill fortune; kalih anvavartata--Kali fully manifested.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, left this earthly planet in His selfsame form, from that
very day Kali, who had already partially appeared, became fully manifest to create inauspicious conditions
for those who are endowed with a poor fund of knowledge.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The influence of Kali can be enforced only upon those who are not fully developed in God
consciousness. One can neutralize the effects of Kali by keeping oneself fully under the supreme care of
the Personality of Godhead. The age of Kali ensued just after the Battle of Kuruksetra, but it could not
exert its influence because of the presence of the Lord. The Lord, however, left this earthly planet in His
own transcendental body, and as soon as He left, the symptoms of the Kali-yuga, as were envisioned by
Maharaja Yudhisthira prior to Arjuna's arrival from Dvaraka, began to manifest, and Maharaja Yudhisthira
rightly conjectured on the departure of the Lord from the earth. As we have already explained, the Lord
left our sight just as when the sun sets it is out of our sight.
