<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
sarvatmanah sama-drso
hy advayasyanahankrteh
tat-krtam mati-vaisamyam
niravadyasya na kvacit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sarva-atmanah--of one who is present in everyone's heart; sama-drsah--of one who is equally kind to
one and all; hi--certainly; advayasya--of the Absolute; anahankrteh--free from all material identity of false
ego; tat-krtam--everything done by Him; mati--consciousness; vaisamyam--differentiation; niravadyasya--
freed from all attachment; na--never; kvacit--at any stage.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is present in everyone's heart. He is equally kind to
everyone, and He is free from the false ego of differentiation. Therefore whatever He does is free from
material inebriety. He is equibalanced.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because He is absolute, there is nothing different from Him. He is kaivalya; there is nothing except
Himself. Everything and everyone is the manifestation of His energy, and thus He is present everywhere
by His energy, being nondifferent from it. The sun is identified with every inch of the sun rays and every
molecular particle of the rays. Similarly, the Lord is distributed by His different energies. He is
Paramatma, or the Supersoul, present in everyone as the supreme guidance, and therefore He is already
the chariot driver and counsel of all living beings. When He, therefore, exhibits Himself as chariot driver
of Arjuna, there is no change in His exalted position. It is the power of devotional service only that
demonstrates Him as the chariot driver or the messenger. Since He has nothing to do with the material
conception of life because He is absolute spiritual identity, there is for Him no superior or inferior action.
Being the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He has no false ego, and so He does not identify Himself with
anything different from Him. The material conception of ego is equibalanced in Him. He does not feel,
therefore, inferior by becoming the chariot driver of His pure devotee. It is the glory of the pure devotee
that only he can bring about service from the affectionate Lord.
