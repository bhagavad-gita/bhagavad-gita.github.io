<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
We never tire of hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, who is glorified by
hymns and prayers. Those who have developed a taste for transcendental relationships with Him relish
hearing of His pastimes at every moment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a great difference between mundane stories, fiction, or history and the transcendental pastimes
of the Lord. The histories of the whole universe contain references to the pastimes of the incarnations of
the Lord. The Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas are histories of bygone ages recorded in
connection with the pastimes of the incarnations of the Lord and therefore remain fresh even after
repeated readings. For example, anyone may read Bhagavad-gita or the Srimad-Bhagavatam repeatedly
throughout his whole life and yet find in them new light of information. Mundane news is static whereas
transcendental news is dynamic, inasmuch as the spirit is dynamic and matter is static. Those who have
developed a taste for understanding the transcendental subject matter are never tired of hearing such
narrations. One is quickly satiated by mundane activities, but no one is satiated by transcendental or
devotional activities. Uttama-sloka indicates that literature which is not meant for nescience. Mundane
literature is in the mode of darkness or ignorance, whereas transcendental literature is quite different.
Transcendental literature is above the mode of darkness, and its light becomes more luminous with
progressive reading and realization of the transcendental subject matter. The so-called liberated persons
are never satisfied by the repetition of the words aham brahmasmi. Such artificial realization of Brahman
becomes hackneyed, and so to relish real pleasure they turn to the narrations of the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Those who are not so fortunate turn to altruism and worldly philanthropy. This means the Mayavada
philosophy is mundane, whereas the philosophy of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam is
transcendental.
