<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Suta Gosvami said: Draupadi then saw Asvatthama, who was bound with ropes like an animal and
silent for having enacted the most inglorious murder. Due to her female nature, and due to her being
naturally good and well-behaved, she showed him due respects as a brahmana.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Asvatthama was condemned by the Lord Himself, and he was treated by Arjuna just like a culprit, not
like the son of a brahmana or teacher. But when he was brought before Srimati Draupadi, she, although
begrieved for the murder of her sons, and although the murderer was present before her, could not
withdraw the due respect generally offered to a brahmana or to the son of a brahmana. This is due to her
mild nature as a woman. Women as a class are no better than boys, and therefore they have no
discriminatory power like that of a man. Asvatthama proved himself to be an unworthy son of Dronacarya
or of a brahmana, and for this reason he was condemned by the greatest authority, Lord Sri Krsna, and yet
a mild woman could not withdraw her natural courtesy for a brahmana.
Even to date, in a Hindu family a woman shows proper respect to the brahmana caste, however fallen
and heinous a brahma-bandhu may be. But the men have begun to protest against brahma-bandhus who
are born in families of good brahmanas but by action are less than sudras.
The specific words used in this sloka are vama-svabhava, "mild and gentle by nature." A good man or
woman accepts anything very easily, but a man of average intelligence does not do so. But, anyway, we
should not give up our reason and discriminatory power just to be gentle. One must have good
discriminatory power to judge a thing on its merit. We should not follow the mild nature of a woman and
thereby accept that which is not genuine. Asvatthama may be respected by a good-natured woman, but
that does not mean that he is as good as a genuine brahmana.
