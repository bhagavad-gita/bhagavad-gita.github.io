<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
yah svakat parato veha
jata-nirveda atmavan
hrdi krtva harim gehat
pravrajet sa narottamah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--anyone who; svakat--by his own awakening; paratah va--or by hearing from another; iha--here in
this world; jata--becomes; nirvedah--indifferent to material attachment; atmavan--consciousness; hrdi--
within the heart; krtva--having been taken by; harim--the Personality of Godhead; gehat--from home;
pravrajet--goes away; sah--he is; nara-uttamah--the first-class human being.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He is certainly a first-class man who awakens and understands, either by himself or from others, the
falsity and misery of this material world and thus leaves home and depends fully on the Personality of
Godhead residing within his heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three classes of transcendentalists, namely, (1) the dhira, or the one who is not disturbed by
being away from family association, (2) one in the renounced order of life, a sannyasi by frustrated
sentiment, and (3) a sincere devotee of the Lord, who awakens God consciousness by hearing and
chanting and leaves home depending completely on the Personality of Godhead, who resides in his heart.
The idea is that the renounced order of life, after a frustrated life of sentiment in the material world, may
be the stepping stone on the path of self-realization, but real perfection of the path of liberation is attained
when one is practiced to depend fully on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who lives in everyone's
heart as Paramatma. One may live in the darkest jungle alone out of home, but a steadfast devotee knows
very well that he is not alone. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is with him, and He can protect His
sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance. One should therefore practice devotional service at home,
hearing and chanting the holy name, quality, form, pastimes, entourage, etc., in association with pure
devotees, and this practice will help one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one's sincerity of
purpose. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, although He sits in everyone's heart. Nor does the Lord give any direction to
persons who worship Him for material gain. Such materialistic devotees may be blessed by the Lord with
material benefits, but they cannot reach the stage of the first-class human being, as above mentioned.
There are many examples of such sincere devotees in the history of the world, especially in India, and
they are our guides on the path of self-realization. Mahatma Vidura is one such great devotee of the Lord,
and we should all try to follow in his lotus footsteps for self-realization.
