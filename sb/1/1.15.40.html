<h2>Text</h2>
visrjya tatra tat sarvam
dukula-valayadikam
nirmamo nirahankarah
sanchinnasesa-bandhanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
visrjya--relinquishing; tatra--all those; tat--that; sarvam--everything; dukula--belt; valaya-adikam--and
bangles; nirmamah--uninterested; nirahankarah--unattached; sanchinna--perfectly cut off; asesabandhanah--
unlimited attachment.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira at once relinquished all his garments, belt and ornaments of the royal order and
became completely disinterested and unattached to everything.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To become purified of material contamination is the necessary qualification for becoming one of the
associates of the Lord. No one can become an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without
such purification. Maharaja Yudhisthira, therefore, to become spiritually pure, at once gave up his royal
opulence, relinquishing his royal dress and garments. The kasaya, or saffron loincloth of a sannyasi,
indicates freedom from all attractive material garments, and thus he changed his dress accordingly. He
became disinterested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material contamination, or
material designation. People are generally attached to various kinds of designations--the designations of
family, society, country, occupation, wealth, position and many others. As long as one is attached to such
designations, he is considered materially impure. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are
attached by national consciousness, but they do not know that such false consciousness is also another
designation of the materially conditioned soul; one has to relinquish such designations before one can
become eligible to go back to Godhead. Foolish people adore such men who die in national
consciousness, but here is an example of Maharaja Yudhisthira, a royal king who prepared himself to
leave this world without such national consciousness. And yet he is remembered even today because he
was a great pious king, almost on the same level with the Personality of Godhead Sri Rama. And because
people of the world were dominated by such pious kings, they were happy in all respects, and it was quite
possible for such great emperors to rule the world.
