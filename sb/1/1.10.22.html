<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, again desiring to give names and forms to His parts and parcels, the living
entities, placed them under the guidance of material nature. By His own potency, material nature is
empowered to re-create.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord. They are of two varieties, namely nitya-mukta and
nitya-baddha. The nitya-muktas are eternally liberated souls, and they are eternally engaged in the
reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode beyond the manifested
mundane creations. But the nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned souls, are entrusted to His external
energy, maya, for rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the Supreme Father. Nitya-baddhas are
eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. They are bewildered by the illusory
energy as products of matter, and thus they are very busy in making plans in the material world for
becoming happy. They go on merrily with plans, but by the will of the Lord both the planmakers and the
plans are annihilated at the end of a certain period, as above mentioned. This is confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita as follows: "O son of Kunti, at the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into
My nature, and again when the time of creation is ripe, I begin creation by the agency of My external
energy." (Bg. 9.7)
The word bhuyah indicates again and again, that is to say the process of creation, maintenance and
annihilation is going on perpetually by the external energy of the Lord. He is the cause of everything. But
the living beings, who are constitutionally the parts and parcels of the Lord and are forgetful of the sweet
relation, are given a chance again to get rid of the clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the
living being's) consciousness, the revealed scriptures are also created by the Lord. Vedic literatures are the
guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they can get free from the repetition of creation and
annihilation of the material world and the material body.
The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gita, "This created world and material energy are under My control.
Under the influence of prakrti, automatically they are created again and again, and this is done by Me
through the agency of My external energy."
Actually the spiritual spark living entities have no material names or forms. But in order to fulfill their
desire to lord it over the material energy of material forms and names, they are given a chance for such
false enjoyment, and at the same time they are given a chance to understand the real position through the
revealed scriptures. The foolish and forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names.
Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms. Men are mad after false name
and form. The form of body obtained under certain conditions is taken up as factual, and the name also
taken bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so many "isms." The
scriptures, however, supply the clue for understanding the real position, but men are reluctant to take
lessons from the scriptures created by the Lord for different places and times. For example, the Bhagavadgita
is the guiding principle for every human being, but by the spell of material energy they do not take
care to carry out the programs of life in terms of the Bhagavad-gita. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the postgraduate
study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the principles of the Bhagavad-gita.
Unfortunately people have no taste for them, and therefore they are under the clutches of maya for
repetition of birth and death.
