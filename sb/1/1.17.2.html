<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
vrsam mrnala-dhavalam
mehantam iva bibhyatam
vepamanam padaikena
sidantam sudra-taditam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vrsam--the bull; mrnala-dhavalam--as white as a white lotus; mehantam--urinating; iva--as if;
bibhyatam--being too afraid; vepamanam--trembling; pada ekena--standing on only one leg; sidantam--
terrified; sudra-taditam--being beaten by a sudra.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The bull was as white as a white lotus flower. He was terrified of the sudra who was beating him, and he
was so afraid that he was standing on one leg, trembling and urinating.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The next symptom of the age of Kali is that principles of religion, which are all spotlessly white, like the
white lotus flower, will be attacked by the uncultured sudra population of the age. They may be
descendants of brahmana or ksatriya forefathers, but in the age of Kali, for want of sufficient education
and culture of Vedic wisdom, such a sudra-like population will defy the principles of religion, and persons
who are religiously endowed will be terrified by such men. They will declare themselves as adherents of
no religious principles, and many "isms" and cults will spring up in Kali-yuga only to kill the spotless bull
of religion. The state will be declared to be secular, or without any particular principle of religion, and as
a result there will be total indifference to the principles of religion. The citizens will be free to act as they
like, without respect for sadhu, sastra and guru. The bull standing on one leg indicates that the principles
of religion are gradually diminishing. Even the fragmental existence of religious principles will be
embarrassed by so many obstacles as if in the trembling condition of falling down at any time.
