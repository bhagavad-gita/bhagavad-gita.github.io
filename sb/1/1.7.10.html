<h2>Translation</h2>
All different varieties of atmaramas [those who take pleasure in atma, or spirit self], especially those
established on the path of self-realization, though freed from all kinds of material bondage, desire to
render unalloyed devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses
transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained this atmarama sloka very vividly before His chief devotee Srila
Sanatana Gosvami. He points out eleven factors in the sloka, namely (1) atmarama, (2) munayah, (3)
nirgrantha, (4) api, (5) ca, (6) urukrama, (7) kurvanti, (8) ahaitukim, (9) bhaktim, (10) ittham-bhutagunah
and (11) harih. According to the Visva-prakasa Sanskrit dictionary, there are seven synonyms for
the word atmarama, which are as follows: (1) Brahman (the Absolute Truth), (2) body, (3) mind, (4)
endeavor, (5) endurance, (6) intelligence and (7) personal habits.
The word munayah refers to (1) those who are thoughtful, (2) those who are grave and silent, (3)
ascetics, (4) the persistent, (5) mendicants, (6) sages and (7) saints.
The word nirgrantha conveys these ideas: (1) one who is liberated from nescience, (2) one who has no
connection with scriptural injunction, i.e., who is freed from the obligation of the rules and regulations
mentioned in the revealed scriptures like ethics, Vedas, philosophy, psychology and metaphysics (in other
words the fools, illiterate, urchins, etc., who have no connection with regulative principles), (3) a
capitalist, and also (4) one who is penniless.
According to the Sabda-kosa dictionary, the affix ni is used in the sense of (1) certainty, (2) counting,
(3) building, and (4) forbiddance, and the word grantha is used in the sense of wealth, thesis, vocabulary,
etc.
The word urukrama means "the one whose activities are glorious." Krama means "step." This word
urukrama specifically indicates the Lord's incarnation as Vamana, who covered the whole universe by
immeasurable steps. Lord Visnu is powerful, and His activities are so glorious that He has created the
spiritual world by His internal potency and the material world by His external potency. By His allpervading
features He is everywhere present as the Supreme Truth, and in His personal feature He is
always present in His transcendental abode of Goloka Vrndavana, where He displays His transcendental
pastimes in all variegatedness. His activities cannot be compared to anyone else's, and therefore the word
urukrama is just applicable to Him only.
According to Sanskrit verbal arrangement, kurvanti refers to doing things for someone else. Therefore, it
means that the atmaramas render devotional service unto the Lord not for personal interest but for the
pleasure of the Lord, Urukrama.
Hetu means "causal." There are many causes for one's sense satisfaction, and they can be chiefly
classified as material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation, which are generally desired by progressive
persons. As far as material enjoyments are concerned, they are innumerable, and the materialists are eager
to increase them more and more because they are under the illusory energy. There is no end to the list of
material enjoyments, nor can anyone in the material universe have all of them. As far as the mystic powers
are concerned, they are eight in all (such as to become the minutest in form, to become weightless, to
have anything one desires, to lord it over the material nature, to control other living beings, to throw
earthly globes in outer space, etc.). These mystic powers are mentioned in the Bhagavatam. The forms of
liberation are five in number.
Therefore, unalloyed devotion means service to the Lord without desire for the above-mentioned
personal benefits. And the powerful Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna can be fully satisfied by such
unalloyed devotees free from all sorts of desires for personal benefit.
Unalloyed devotional service of the Lord progresses in different stages. Practice of devotional service in
the material field is of eighty-one different qualities, and above such activities is the transcendental
practice of devotional service, which is one and is called sadhana-bhakti. When unalloyed practice of
sadhana-bhakti is matured into transcendental love for the Lord, the transcendental loving service of the
Lord begins gradually developing into nine progressive stages of loving service under the headings of
attachment, love, affection, feelings, affinity, adherence, following, ecstasy, and intense feelings of
separation.
The attachment of an inactive devotee develops up to the stage of transcendental love of God.
Attachment of an active servitor develops up to the stage of adherence, and that for a friendly devotee
develops up to the stage of following, and the same is also the case for the paternal devotees. Devotees in
conjugal love develop ecstasy up to the stage of intense feelings of separation. These are some of the
features of unalloyed devotional service of the Lord.
According to Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, the import of the word ittham-bhuta is "complete bliss."
Transcendental bliss in the realization of impersonal Brahman becomes comparable to the scanty water
contained in the pit made by a cow's hoof. It is nothing compared with the ocean of bliss of the vision of
the Personality of Godhead. The personal form of Lord Sri Krsna is so attractive that it comprehends all
attraction, all bliss and all tastes (rasas). These attractions are so strong that no one wants to exchange
them for material enjoyment, mystic powers and liberation. There is no need of logical arguments in
support of this statement, but out of one's own nature one becomes attracted by the qualities of Lord Sri
Krsna. We must know for certain that the qualities of the Lord have nothing to do with mundane
qualities. All of them are full of bliss, knowledge and eternity. There are innumerable qualities of the
Lord, and one is attracted by one quality while another is attracted by another.
Great sages, such as the four bachelor-devotees Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda and Sanat-kumara, were
attracted by the fragrance of flowers and tulasi leaves anointed with the pulp of sandalwood offered at the
lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly, Sukadeva Gosvami was attracted by the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord. Sukadeva Gosvami was already situated in the liberated stage, yet he was attracted by the pastimes
of the Lord. This proves that the quality of His pastimes has nothing to do with material affinity.
Similarly, the young cowherd damsels were attracted by the bodily features of the Lord, and Rukmini was
attracted by hearing about the glories of the Lord. Lord Krsna attracts even the mind of the goddess of
fortune. He attracts, in special cases, the minds of all young girls. He attracts the minds of the elderly
ladies by paternal affection. He attracts the mind of the male in the humors of servitude and friendship.
The word hari conveys various meanings, but the chief import of the word is that He (the Lord)
vanquishes everything inauspicious and takes away the mind of the devotee by awarding pure
transcendental love. By remembering the Lord in acute distress one can be free from all varieties of
miseries and anxieties. Gradually the Lord vanquishes all obstacles on the path of devotional service of a
pure devotee, and the result of nine devotional activities, such as hearing and chanting, becomes
manifested.
By His personal features and transcendental attributes, the Lord attracts all psychological activities of a
pure devotee. Such is the attractive power of Lord Krsna. The attraction is so powerful that a pure devotee
never hankers for any one of the four principles of religion. These are the attractive features of the
transcendental attributes of the Lord. And adding to this the words api and ca, one can increase the
imports unlimitedly. According to Sanskrit grammar there are seven synonyms for the word api.
So by interpreting each and every word of this sloka, one can see unlimited numbers of transcendental
qualities of Lord Krsna that attract the mind of a pure devotee.
