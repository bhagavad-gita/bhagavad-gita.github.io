<h2>Text</h2>
anagahsv iha bhutesu
ya agas-krn nirankusah
ahartasmi bhujam saksad
amartyasyapi sangadam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
anagahsu iha--to the offenseless; bhutesu--living beings; yah--the person; agah-krt--commits offense;
nirankusah--upstart; aharta asmi--I shall bring forth; bhujam--arms; saksat--directly; amartyasya api--even
one who is a demigod; sa-angadam--with decorations and armor.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
An upstart living being who commits offenses by torturing those who are offenseless shall be directly
uprooted by me, even though he be a denizen of heaven with armor and decorations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The denizens of the heavenly kingdom are called amara, or deathless, due to their possessing a long
span of life, far greater than that of the human beings. For a human being, who has only a maximum onehundred-
year duration of life, a span of life spreading over millions of years is certainly considered to be
deathless. For example, from the Bhagavad-gita we learn that on the Brahmaloka planet the duration of
one day is calculated to be 4,300,000 x 1,000 solar years. Similarly, in other heavenly planets one day is
calculated to be six months of this planet, and the inhabitants get a life of ten million of their years.
Therefore, in all higher planets, since the span of life is far greater than that of the human being, the
denizens are called deathless by imagination, although actually no one within the material universe is
deathless.
Maharaja Pariksit challenges even such denizens of heaven if they torture the offenseless. This means
that the state executive head must be as strong as Maharaja Pariksit so that he may be determined to
punish the strongest offenders. It should be the principle of a state executive head that the offender of the
codes of God is always punished.
