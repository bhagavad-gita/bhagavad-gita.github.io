<h2>Translation</h2>
The father heard from his son that the King had been cursed, although he should never have been
condemned, for he was the best amongst all human beings. The rsi did not congratulate his son, but, on
the contrary, began to repent, saying: Alas! What a great sinful act was performed by my son. He has
awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The king is the best of all human beings. He is the representative of God, and he is never to be
condemned for any of his actions. In other words, the king can do no wrong. The king may order hanging
of a culprit son of a brahmana, but he does not become sinful for killing a brahmana. Even if there is
something wrong with the king, he is never to be condemned. A medical practitioner may kill a patient by
mistaken treatment, but such a killer is never condemned to death. So what to speak of a good and pious
king like Maharaja Pariksit? In the Vedic way of life, the king is trained to become a rajarsi, or a great
saint, although he is ruling as king. It is the king only by whose good government the citizens can live
peacefully and without any fear. The rajarsis would manage their kingdoms so nicely and piously that
their subjects would respect them as if they were the Lord. That is the instruction of the Vedas. The king
is called narendra, or the best amongst the human beings. How then could a king like Maharaja Pariksit
be condemned by an inexperienced, puffed-up son of a brahmana, even though he had attained the
powers of a qualified brahmana?
Since Samika Rsi was an experienced, good brahmana, he did not approve of the actions of his
condemned son. He began to lament for all that his son had done. The king was beyond the jurisdiction of
curses as a general rule, and what to speak of a good king like Maharaja Pariksit. The offense of the King
was most insignificant, and his being condemned to death was certainly a very great sin for Srngi.
Therefore Rsi Samika regretted the whole incident.
