TRANSLATION
You have been blind from your very birth, and recently you have become hard of hearing. Your memory
is shortened, and your intelligence is disturbed. Your teeth are loose, your liver is defective, and you are
coughing up mucus.
PURPORT
The symptoms of old age, which had already developed in Dhrtarastra, were all one after another
pointed out to him as warning that death was nearing very quickly, and still he was foolishly carefree
about his future. The signs pointed out by Vidura in the body of Dhrtarastra were signs of apaksaya, or
dwindling of the material body before the last stroke of death. The body is born, it develops, stays, creates
other bodies, dwindles and then vanishes. But foolish men want to make a permanent settlement of the
perishable body and think that their estate, children, society, country, etc., will give them protection.
With such foolish ideas, they become overtaken by such temporary engagements and forget altogether
that they must give up this temporary body and take a new one, again to arrange for another term of
society, friendship and love, again to perish ultimately. They forget their permanent identity and become
foolishly active for impermanent occupations, forgetting altogether their prime duty. Saints and sages like
Vidura approach such foolish men to awaken them to the real situation, but they take such sadhus and
saints as parasites of society, and almost all of them refuse to hear the words of such sadhus and saints,
although they welcome show-bottle sadhus and so-called saints who can satisfy their senses. Vidura was
not a sadhu to satisfy the ill-gotten sentiment of Dhrtarastra. He was correctly pointing out the real
situation of life, and how one can save oneself from such catastrophies.
