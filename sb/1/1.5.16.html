paravara-jnah sa rsih
kalenavyakta-ramhasa
yuga-dharma-vyatikaram
praptam bhuvi yuge yuge
SYNONYMS
para-avara--past and future; jnah--one who knows; sah--he; rsih--Vyasadeva; kalena--in the course of
time; avyakta--unmanifested; ramhasa--by great force; yuga-dharma--acts in terms of the millennium;
vyatikaram--anomalies; praptam--having accrued; bhuvi--on the earth; yuge yuge--different ages.
TRANSLATION
The great sage Vyasadeva saw anomalies in the duties of the millennium. This happens on the earth in
different ages, due to unseen forces in the course of time.
PURPORT
The great sages like Vyasadeva are liberated souls, and therefore they can see clearly past and future.
Thus he could see the future anomalies in the Kali age, and accordingly he made arrangement for the
people in general so that they can execute a progressive life in this age, which is full of darkness. The
people in general in this age of Kali are too much interested in matter, which is temporary. Because of
ignorance they are unable to evaluate the assets of life and be enlightened in spiritual knowledge.

TRANSLATION
The great sage, who was fully equipped in knowledge, could see, through his transcendental vision, the
deterioration of everything material, due to the influence of the age. He could also see that the faithless
people in general would be reduced in duration of life and would be impatient due to lack of goodness.
Thus he contemplated for the welfare of men in all statuses and orders of life.
PURPORT
The unmanifested forces of time are so powerful that they reduce all matter to oblivion in due course. In
Kali-yuga, the last millennium of a round of four millenniums, the power of all material objects
deteriorates by the influence of time. In this age the duration of the material body of the people in general
is much reduced, and so is the memory. The action of matter has also not so much incentive. The land
does not produce food grains in the same proportions as it did in other ages. The cow does not give as
much milk as it used to give formerly. The production of vegetables and fruits is less than before. As such,
all living beings, both men and animals, do not have sumptuous, nourishing food. Due to want of so many
necessities of life, naturally the duration of life is reduced, the memory is short, intelligence is meager,
mutual dealings are full of hypocrisy and so on.
The great sage Vyasadeva could see this by his transcendental vision. As an astrologer can see the future
fate of a man, or an astronomer can foretell the solar and lunar eclipses, those liberated souls who can see
through the scriptures can foretell the future of all mankind. They can see this due to their sharp vision of
spiritual attainment.
And all such transcendentalists, who are naturally devotees of the Lord, are always eager to render
welfare service to the people in general. They are the real friends of the people in general, not the socalled
public leaders who are unable to see what is going to happen five minutes ahead. In this age the
people in general as well as their so-called leaders are all unlucky fellows, faithless in spiritual knowledge
and influenced by the age of Kali. They are always disturbed by various diseases. For example, in the
present age there are so many TB patients and TB hospitals, but formerly this was not so because the time
was not so unfavorable. The unfortunate men of this age are always reluctant to give a reception to the
transcendentalists who are representatives of Srila Vyasadeva and selfless workers always busy in planning
something which may help everyone in all statuses and orders of life. The greatest philanthropists are
those transcendentalists who represent the mission of Vyasa, Narada, Madhva, Caitanya, Rupa, Sarasvati,
etc. They are all one and the same. The personalities may be different, but the aim of the mission is one
and the same, namely, to deliver the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead.
