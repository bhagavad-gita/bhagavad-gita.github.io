TRANSLATION
If the illusory energy subsides and the living entity becomes fully enriched with knowledge by the grace
of the Lord, then he becomes at once enlightened with self-realization and thus becomes situated in his
own glory.
PURPORT
Because the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms, names, pastimes, attributes, associates
and energies are identical with Him. His transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The
same energy acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotency He can perform
anything and everything through the agency of any of the above energies. He can turn the external energy
into internal by His will. Therefore by His grace the external energy, which is employed in illusioning
those living beings who want to have it, subsides by the will of the Lord in terms of repentance and
penance for the conditioned soul. And the very same energy then acts to help the purified living being
make progress on the path of self-realization. The example of electrical energy is very appropriate in this
connection. The expert electrician can utilize the electrical energy for both heating and cooling by
adjustment only. Similarly, the external energy, which now bewilders the living being into continuation of
birth and death, is turned into internal potency by the will of the Lord to lead the living being to eternal
life. When a living being is thus graced by the Lord, he is placed in his proper constitutional position to
enjoy eternal spiritual life.
