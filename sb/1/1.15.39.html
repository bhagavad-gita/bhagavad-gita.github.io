<h2>Text</h2>
mathurayam tatha vajram
surasena-patim tatah
prajapatyam nirupyestim
agnin apibad isvarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mathurayam--at Mathura; tatha--also; vajram--Vajra; surasena-patim--King of the Surasenas; tatah--
thereafter; prajapatyam--Prajapatya sacrifice; nirupya--having performed; istim--goal; agnin--fire; apibat--
placed in himself; isvarah--capable.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Then he posted Vajra, the son of Aniruddha [grandson of Lord Krsna], at Mathura as the King of
Surasena. Afterwards Maharaja Yudhisthira performed a Prajapatya sacrifice and placed in himself the fire
for quitting household life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira, after placing Maharaja Pariksit on the imperial throne of Hastinapura, and after
posting Vajra, the great-grandson of Lord Krsna, as the King of Mathura, accepted the renounced order of
life. The system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and work, known as varnasramadharma,
is the beginning of real human life, and Maharaja Yudhisthira, as the protector of this system of
human activities, timely retired from active life as a sannyasi, handing over the charge of the
administration to a trained prince, Maharaja Pariksit. The scientific system of varnasrama-dharma divides
the human life into four divisions of occupation and four orders of life. The four orders of life as
brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasi are to be followed by all, irrespective of the occupational
division. Modern politicians do not wish to retire from active life, even if they are old enough, but
Yudhisthira Maharaja, as an ideal king, voluntarily retired from active administrative life to prepare
himself for the next life. Everyone's life must be so arranged that the last stage of life, say at least the last
fifteen to twenty years prior to death, can be absolutely devoted to the devotional service of the Lord to
attain the highest perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of one's life in
material enjoyment and fruitive activities, because as long as the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work
for material enjoyment, there is no chance of getting out from conditioned life, or material bondage. No
one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one's supreme task of attaining the highest perfection
of life, namely going back home, back to Godhead.
