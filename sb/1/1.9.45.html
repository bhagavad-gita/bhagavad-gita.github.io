<h2>Text</h2>
tatra dundubhayo nedur
deva-manava-vaditah
sasamsuh sadhavo rajnam
khat petuh puspa-vrstayah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--thereafter; dundubhayah--drums; neduh--were sounded; deva--the demigods from other planets;
manava--men from all countries; vaditah--beaten by; sasamsuh--praised; sadhavah--honest; rajnam--by the
royal order; khat--from the sky; petuh--began to fall; puspa-vrstayah--showers of flowers.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, both men and demigods sounded drums in honor, and the honest royal order commenced
demonstrations of honor and respect. And from the sky fell showers of flowers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhismadeva was respected both by the human beings and by the demigods. The human beings live on
earth and similar other planets in the Bhur and Bhuvar group of planets, but the demigods live in the Svar,
or heavenly planets, and all of them knew Bhismadeva as a great warrior and devotee of the Lord. As a
mahajana (or authority) he was on the level of Brahma, Narada and Siva, although he was a human being.
Qualification on a par with the great demigods is possible only on attainment of spiritual perfection. Thus
Bhismadeva was known all over the universes, and during his time interplanetary travel was effected by
finer methods than the futile endeavors of mechanical spacecraft. When the distant planets were informed
of the passing away of Bhismadeva, all the inhabitants of the upper planets as well as of the earth dropped
showers of flowers to show due respect to the departed great personality. This showering of flowers from
heaven is a sign of recognition by great demigods, and it should never be compared to the decoration of a
dead body. The body of Bhismadeva lost its material effects due to being surcharged with spiritual
realization, and thus the body was spiritualized as when iron becomes red-hot when in contact with fire.
The body of a fully self-realized soul is not, therefore, accepted as material. Special ceremonies are
observed for such spiritual bodies. The respect and recognition of Bhismadeva are never to be imitated by
artificial means, as it has become a fashion to observe the so-called jayanti ceremony for any and every
common man. According to authorized sastras, such a jayanti ceremony for an ordinary man, however
exalted he may be materially, is an offense to the Lord because jayanti is reserved for the day when the
Lord appears on the earth. Bhismadeva was unique in his activities, and his passing away to the kingdom
of God is also unique.
