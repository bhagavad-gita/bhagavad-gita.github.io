etah param stritvam apastapesalam
nirasta-saucam bata sadhu kurvate

na jatv apaity ahrtibhir hrdi sprsan

nirasta--without; saucam--purity; bata sadhu--auspiciously glorified; kurvate--do they make; yasam--from
whose; grhat--homes; puskara-locanah--the lotus-eyed; patih--husband; na jatu--never at any time; apaiti--

TRANSLATION
All these women auspiciously glorified their lives despite their being without individuality and without
purity. Their husband, the lotus-eyed Personality of Godhead, never left them alone at home. He always
pleased their hearts by making valuable presentations.
PURPORT
The devotees of the Lord are purified souls. As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the
Lord sincerely, the Lord accepts them, and thus the devotees at once become free from all material
contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There is no bodily
disqualification of a devotee, just as there is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the
filthy drain water when they are amalgamated. Women, merchants and laborers are not very intelligent,
and thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science of God or to be engaged in the devotional
service of the Lord. They are more materialistic, and less than them are the Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras,
Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhiras, Kankas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., but all of them can be delivered if they are
properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lord, the
designative disqualifications are removed, and as pure souls they become eligible to enter into the
kingdom of God.
The fallen girls under the clutches of Bhaumasura sincerely prayed to Lord Sri Krsna for their
deliverance, and their sincerity of purpose made them at once pure by virtue of devotion. The Lord
therefore accepted them as His wives, and thus their lives became glorified. Such auspicious glorification
was still more glorified when the Lord played with them as the most devoted husband.
The Lord used to live with His 16,108 wives constantly. He expanded Himself into 16,108 plenary
portions, and each and every one of them was the Lord Himself without deviation from the Original
Personality. The Sruti-mantra affirms that the Lord can expand Himself into many. As husband of so
many wives, He pleased them all with presentations, even at a costly endeavor. He brought the parijata
plant from heaven and implanted it at the palace of Satyabhama, one of the principal queens. If, therefore,
anyone desires the Lord to become one's husband, the Lord fulfills such desires in full.
