<h2>Text</h2>
etad rupam bhagavato
hy arupasya cid-atmanah
maya-gunair viracitam
mahadadibhir atmani
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--all these; rupam--forms; bhagavatah--of the Lord; hi--certainly; arupasya--of one who has no
material form; cit-atmanah--of the Transcendence; maya--material energy; gunaih--by the qualities;
viracitam--manufactured; mahat-adibhih--with the ingredients of matter; atmani--in the self.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The conception of the virat universal form of the Lord, as appearing in the material world, is imaginary.
It is to enable the less intelligent [and neophytes] to adjust to the idea of the Lord's having form. But
factually the Lord has no material form.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conception of the Lord known as the visva-rupa or the virat-rupa is particularly not mentioned
along with the various incarnations of the Lord because all the incarnations of the Lord mentioned above
are transcendental and there is not a tinge of materialism in their bodies. There is no difference between
the body and self as there is in the conditioned soul. The virat-rupa is conceived for those who are just
neophyte worshipers. For them the material virat-rupa is presented, and it will be explained in the Second
Canto. In the virat-rupa the material manifestations of different planets have been conceived as His legs,
hands, etc. Actually all such descriptions are for the neophytes. The neophytes cannot conceive of
anything beyond matter. The material conception of the Lord is not counted in the list of His factual
forms. As Paramatma, or Supersoul, the Lord is within each and every material form, even within the
atoms, but the outward material form is but an imagination, both for the Lord and for the living being.
The present forms of the conditioned souls are also not factual. The conclusion is that the material
conception of the body of the Lord as virat is imaginary. Both the Lord and the living beings are living
spirits and have original spiritual bodies.
