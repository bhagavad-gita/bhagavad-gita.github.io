TRANSLATION
O Vyasadeva, your vision is completely perfect. Your good fame is spotless. You are firm in vow and
situated in truthfulness. And thus you can think of the pastimes of the Lord in trance for the liberation of
the people in general from all material bondage.
PURPORT
People in general have a taste for literatures by instinct. They want to hear and read from the authorities
something about the unknown, but their taste is exploited by unfortunate literatures which are full of
subject matter for satisfaction of the material senses. Such literatures contain different kinds of mundane
poems and philosophical speculations, more or less under the influence of maya, ending in sense
gratification. These literatures, although worthless in the true sense of the term, are variously decorated to
attract the attention of the less intelligent men. Thus the attracted living entities are more and more
entangled in material bondage without hope of liberation for thousands and thousands of generations. Sri
Narada Rsi, being the best amongst the Vaisnavas, is compassionate toward such unfortunate victims of
worthless literatures, and thus he advises Sri Vyasadeva to compose transcendental literature which is not
only attractive but can also actually bring liberation from all kinds of bondage. Srila Vyasadeva or his
representatives are qualified because they are rightly trained to see things in true perspective. Srila
Vyasadeva and his representatives are pure in thought due to their spiritual enlightenment, fixed in their
vows due to their devotional service, and determined to deliver the fallen souls rotting in material
activities. The fallen souls are very eager to receive novel informations every day, and the
transcendentalists like Vyasadeva or Narada can supply such eager people in general with unlimited news
from the spiritual world. In the Bhagavad-gita it is said that the material world is only a part of the whole
creation and that this earth is only a fragment of the whole material world.
There are thousands and thousands of literary men all over the world, and they have created many,
many thousands of literary works for the information of the people in general for thousands and
thousands of years. Unfortunately none of them have brought peace and tranquillity on the earth. This is
due to a spiritual vacuum in those literatures; therefore the Vedic literatures, especially the Bhagavad-gita
and the Srimad-Bhagavatam, are specifically recommended to suffering humanity to bring about the
desired effect of liberation from the pangs of material civilization, which is eating the vital part of human
energy. The Bhagavad-gita is the spoken message of the Lord Himself recorded by Vyasadeva, and the
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the transcendental narration of the activities of the same Lord Krsna, which alone
can satisfy the hankering desires of the living being for eternal peace and liberation from miseries. Srimad-
Bhagavatam, therefore, is meant for all the living beings all over the universe for total liberation from all
kinds of material bondage. Such transcendental narrations of the pastimes of the Lord can be described
only by liberated souls like Vyasadeva and his bona fide representatives who are completely merged in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord. Only to such devotees do the pastimes of the Lord and their
transcendental nature become automatically manifest by dint of devotional service. No one else can either
know or describe the acts of the Lord, even if they speculate on the subject for many, many years. The
descriptions of the Bhagavatam are so precise and accurate that whatever has been predicted in this great
literature about five thousand years ago is now exactly happening. Therefore, the vision of the author
comprehends past, present and future. Such liberated persons as Vyasadeva are perfect not only by the
power of vision and wisdom, but also in aural reception, in thinking, feeling and all other sense activities.
A liberated person possesses perfect senses, and with perfect senses only can one serve the sense
proprietor, Hrsikesa, Sri Krsna the Personality of Godhead. Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, is the perfect
description of the all-perfect Personality of Godhead by the all-perfect personality Srila Vyasadeva, the
compiler of the Vedas.
