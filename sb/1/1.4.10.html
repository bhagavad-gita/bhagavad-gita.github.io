<h2>Text</h2>
sa samrat kasya va hetoh
pandunam mana-vardhanah
prayopavisto gangayam
anadrtyadhirat-sriyam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; samrat--the Emperor; kasya--for what; va--or; hetoh--reason; pandunam--of the sons of Pandu;
mana-vardhanah--one who enriches the family; praya-upavistah--sitting and fasting; gangayam--on the
bank of the Ganges; anadrtya--neglecting; adhirat--acquired kingdom; sriyam--opulences.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He was a great emperor and possessed all the opulences of his acquired kingdom. He was so exalted that
he was increasing the prestige of the Pandu dynasty. Why did he give up everything to sit down on the
bank of the Ganges and fast until death?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit was the Emperor of the world and all the seas and oceans, and he did not have to take
the trouble to acquire such a kingdom by his own effort. He inherited it from his grandfathers Maharaja
Yudhisthira and brothers. Besides that, he was doing well in the administration and was worthy of the
good names of his forefathers. Consequently there was nothing undesirable in his opulence and
administration. Then why should he give up all these favorable circumstances and sit down on the bank
of the Ganges, fasting till death? This is astonishing, and therefore all were eager to know the cause.
