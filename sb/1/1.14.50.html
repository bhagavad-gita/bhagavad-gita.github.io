nispaditam deva-krtyam
avasesam pratiksate
tavad yuyam aveksadhvam
bhaved yavad ihesvarah
SYNONYMS
nispaditam--performed; deva-krtyam--what was to be done on behalf of the demigods; avasesam--the
rest; pratiksate--being awaited; tavat--up to that time; yuyam--all of you Pandavas; aveksadhvam--observe
and wait; bhavet--may; yavat--as long as; iha--in this world; isvarah--the Supreme Lord.
TRANSLATION
The Lord has already performed His duties to help the demigods, and He is awaiting the rest. You
Pandavas may wait as long as the Lord is here on earth.
PURPORT
The Lord descends from His abode (Krsnaloka), the topmost planet in the spiritual sky, in order to help
the demigod administrators of this material world when they are greatly vexed by the asuras, who are
envious not only of the Lord but also of His devotees. As referred to above, the conditioned living beings
contact material association by their own choice, dictated by a strong desire to lord it over the resources
of the material world and become imitation lords of all they survey. Everyone is trying to become an
imitation God; there is keen competition amongst such imitation gods, and such competitors are generally
known as asuras. When there are too many asuras in the world, then it becomes a hell for those who are
devotees of the Lord. Due to the growth of the asuras, the mass of people who are generally devoted to the
Lord by nature and the pure devotees of the Lord, including the demigods in higher planets, pray to the
Lord for relief, and the Lord either descends personally from His abode or deputes some of His devotees
to remodel the fallen condition of human society, or even animal society. Such disruptions take place not
only in human society but also among animals, birds or other living beings, including the demigods in the
higher planets. Lord Sri Krsna descended personally to vanquish asuras like Kamsa, Jarasandha and
Sisupala, and during the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira almost all these asuras were killed by the Lord.
Now he was awaiting the annihilation of His own dynasty, called the Yadu-vamsa, who appeared by His
will in this world. He wanted to take them away before His own departure to His eternal abode. Narada,
like Vidura, did not disclose the imminent annihilation of the Yadu dynasty, but indirectly gave a hint to
the King and his brothers to wait till the incident happened and the Lord departed.
