<h2>Translation</h2>
Afterwards, when the Lord asked permission to depart and the King gave it, the Lord offered His
respects to Maharaja Yudhisthira by bowing down at his feet, and the King embraced Him. After this the
Lord, being embraced by others and receiving their obeisances, got into His chariot.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the elder cousin of Lord Krsna, and therefore while departing from him the
Lord bowed down at the King's feet. The King embraced Him as a younger brother, although the King
knew perfectly well that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord takes pleasure when
some of His devotees accept Him as less important in terms of love. No one is greater than or equal to the
Lord, but He takes pleasure in being treated as younger than His devotees. These are all transcendental
pastimes of the Lord. The impersonalist cannot enter into the supernatural roles played by the devotee of
the Lord. Thereafter Bhima and Arjuna embraced the Lord because they were of the same age, but Nakula
and Sahadeva bowed down before the Lord because they were younger than He.
