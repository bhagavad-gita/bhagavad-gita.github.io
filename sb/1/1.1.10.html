<h2>Translation</h2>
O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided,
unlucky and, above all, always disturbed.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees of the Lord are always anxious for the spiritual improvement of the general public. When
the sages of Naimisaranya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this age of Kali, they foresaw that
men would live short lives. In Kali-yuga, the duration of life is shortened not so much because of
insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple food, any
man can maintain his health. Overeating, over-sense gratification, overdependence on another's mercy,
and artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is
shortened.
The people of this age are also very lazy, not only materially but in the matter of self-realization. The
human life is especially meant for self-realization. That is to say, man should come to know what he is,
what the world is, and what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can
end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to
Godhead, his eternal home. But, due to a bad system of education, men have no desire for self-realization.
Even if they come to know about it, they unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers.
In this age, men are victims not only of different political creeds and parties, but also of many different
types of sense-gratificatory diversions, such as cinemas, sports, gambling, clubs, mundane libraries, bad
association, smoking, drinking, cheating, pilfering, bickerings, and so on. Their minds are always
disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this age, many unscrupulous men
manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scriptures, and very often
people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequently, in the
name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of
mind nor health of body. The student (brahmacari) communities are no longer being maintained, and
householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the grhastha-asrama. Consequently, the socalled
vanaprasthas and sannyasis who come out of such grhastha-asramas are easily deviated from the
rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer
interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the
maintenance of such material civilizations, man has formed complex nations and communities, and there
is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficult,
therefore, to raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of
Naimisaranya are anxious to disentangle all fallen souls, and here they are seeking the remedy from Srila
Suta Gosvami.
