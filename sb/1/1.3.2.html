<h2>Translation</h2>
A part of the purusa lies down within the water of the universe, from the navel lake of His body sprouts
a lotus stem, and from the lotus flower atop this stem, Brahma, the master of all engineers in the universe,
becomes manifest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The first purusa is the Karanodakasayi Visnu. From His skin holes innumerable universes have sprung
up. In each and every universe, the purusa enters as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu. He is lying within the half
of the universe which is full with the water of His body. And from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu has
sprung the stem of the lotus flower, the birthplace of Brahma, who is the father of all living beings and the
master of all the demigod engineers engaged in the perfect design and working of the universal order.
Within the stem of the lotus there are fourteen divisions of planetary systems, and the earthly planets are
situated in the middle. Upwards there are other, better planetary systems, and the topmost system is
called Brahmaloka or Satyaloka. Downwards from the earthly planetary system there are seven lower
planetary systems inhabited by the asuras and similar other materialistic living beings.
From Garbhodakasayi Visnu there is expansion of the Ksirodakasayi Visnu, who is the collective
Paramatma of all living beings. He is called Hari, and from Him all incarnations within the universe are
expanded.
Therefore, the conclusion is that the purusa-avatara is manifested in three features -- first the
Karanodakasayi who creates aggregate material ingredients in the mahat-tattva, second the
Garbhodakasayi who enters in each and every universe, and third the Ksirodakasayi Visnu who is the
Paramatma of every material object, organic or inorganic. One who knows these plenary features of the
Personality of Godhead knows Godhead properly, and thus the knower becomes freed from the material
conditions of birth, death, old age and disease, as it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, In this sloka the
subject matter of Maha-Visnu is summarized. The Maha-Visnu lies down in some part of the spiritual sky
by His own free will. Thus He lies on the ocean of karana, from where He glances over His material
nature, and the mahat-tattva is at once created. Thus electrified by the power of the Lord, the material
nature at once creates innumerable universes, just as in due course a tree decorates itself with
innumerable grown fruits. The seed of the tree is sown by the cultivator, and the tree or creeper in due
course becomes manifested with so many fruits. Nothing can take place without a cause. The Karana
Ocean is therefore called the Causal Ocean. Karana means "causal." We should not foolishly accept the
atheistic theory of creation. The description of the atheists is given in the Bhagavad-gita. The atheist does
not believe in the creator, but he cannot give a good theory to explain the creation. Material nature has no
power to create without the power of the purusa, just as a prakrti, or woman, cannot produce a child
without the connection of a purusa, or man. The purusa impregnates, and the prakrti delivers. We should
not expect milk from the fleshy bags on the neck of a goat, although they look like breastly nipples.
Similarly, we should not expect any creative power from the material ingredients; we must believe in the
power of the purusa, who impregnates prakrti, or nature. Because the Lord wished to lie down in
meditation, the material energy created innumerable universes at once, in each of them the Lord lay
down, and thus all the planets and the different paraphernalia were created at once by the will of the Lord.
The Lord has unlimited potencies, and thus He can act as He likes by perfect planning, although
personally He has nothing to do. No one is greater than or equal to Him. That is the verdict of the Vedas.
