<h2>Text</h2>
munayah sadhu prsto 'ham
bhavadbhir loka-mangalam
yat krtah krsna-samprasno
yenatma suprasidati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
munayah--O sages; sadhu--this is relevant; prstah--questioned; aham--myself; bhavadbhih--by all of you;
loka--the world; mangalam--welfare; yat--because; krtah--made; krsna--the Personality of Godhead;
samprasnah--relevant question; yena--by which; atma--self; suprasidati--completely pleased.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord
Krsna and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely
satisfying the self.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since it has been stated hereinbefore that in the Bhagavatam the Absolute Truth is to be known, the
questions of the sages of Naimisaranya are proper and just, because they pertain to Krsna, who is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) the Personality of
Godhead says that in all the Vedas there is nothing but the urge for searching after Him, Lord Krsna. Thus
the questions that pertain to Krsna are the sum and substance of all the Vedic inquiries.
The whole world is full of questions and answers. The birds, beasts and men are all busy in the matter of
perpetual questions and answers. In the morning the birds in the nest become busy with questions and
answers, and in the evening also the same birds come back and again become busy with questions and
answers. The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night, is busy with questions and answers. The
businessmen in the market are busy with questions and answers, and so also the lawyers in the court and
the students in the schools and colleges. The legislators in the parliament are also busy with questions and
answers, and the politicians and the press representatives are all busy with questions and answers.
Although they go on making such questions and answers for their whole lives, they are not at all satisfied.
Satisfaction of the soul can only be obtained by questions and answers on the subject of Krsna.
Krsna is our most intimate master, friend, father or son and object of conjugal love. Forgetting Krsna,
we have created so many objects of questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete
satisfaction. All things--but Krsna--give temporary satisfaction only, so if we are to have complete
satisfaction we must take to the questions and answers about Krsna. We cannot live for a moment without
being questioned or without giving answers. Because the Srimad-Bhagavatam deals with questions and
answers that are related to Krsna, we can derive the highest satisfaction only by reading and hearing this
transcendental literature. One should learn the Srimad-Bhagavatam and make an all-around solution to all
problems pertaining to social, political or religious matters. Srimad-Bhagavatam and Krsna are the sum
total of all things.
