sanjaya uvaca
naham veda vyavasitam
pitror vah kula-nandana
gandharya va maha-baho

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sanjayah uvaca--Sanjaya said; na--not; aham--I; veda--know; vyavasitam--determination; pitroh--of your
uncles; vah--your; kula-nandana--O descendant of the Kuru dynasty; gandharyah--of Gandhari; va--or;
maha-baho--O great King; musitah--cheated; asmi--I have been; maha-atmabhih--by those great souls.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sanjaya said: My dear descendant of the Kuru dynasty, I have no information of the determination of
your two uncles and Gandhari. O King, I have been cheated by those great souls.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That great souls cheat others may be astonishing to know, but it is a fact that great souls cheat others for
a great cause. It is said that Lord Krsna also advised Yudhisthira to tell a lie before Dronacarya, and it was
also for a great cause. The Lord wanted it, and therefore it was a great cause. Satisfaction of the Lord is the
criterion of one who is bona fide, and the highest perfection of life is to satisfy the Lord by one's
occupational duty. That is the verdict of Gita and Bhagavatam.
)
atah pumbhir dvija-srestha
varnasrama-vibhagasah
svanusthitasya dharmasya
samsiddhir hari-tosanam
(Bhag. 1.2.13)* Dhrtarastra and Vidura, followed by Gandhari, did not disclose their determination to
Sanjaya, although he was constantly with Dhrtarastra as his personal assistant. Sanjaya never thought that
Dhrtarastra could perform any act without consulting him. But Dhrtarastra's going away from home was
so confidential that it could not be disclosed even to Sanjaya. Sanatana Gosvami also cheated the keeper of
the prison house while going away to see Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and similarly Raghunatha dasa
Gosvami also cheated his priest and left home for good to satisfy the Lord. To satisfy the Lord, anything is
good, for it is in relation with the Absolute Truth. We also had the same opportunity to cheat the family
members and leave home to engage in the service of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Such cheating was necessary for
a great cause, and there is no loss for any party in such transcendental fraud.
