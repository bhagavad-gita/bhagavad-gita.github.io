<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: O learned brahmanas, Maharaja Pariksit then began to rule over the world as a great
devotee of the Lord under the instructions of the best of the twice-born brahmanas. He ruled by those
great qualities which were foretold by expert astrologers at the time of his birth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the time of Maharaja Pariksit's birth, the expert astrologer-brahmanas foretold some of his qualities.
Maharaja Pariksit developed all those qualities, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is
to become a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop.
Maharaja Pariksit was a maha-bhagavata, or a first-class devotee, who was not only well versed in the
science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions.
Maharaja Pariksit was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and thus he used to consult great sages and
learned brahmanas, who could advise him by the sastras how to execute the state administration. Such
great kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because they obliged the great
authorities by following their instructions left in Vedic literatures. There was no need for impractical fools
to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. The
rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yajnavalkya, Parasara and other
liberated sages, and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and
regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like Maharaja Pariksit had their council of
advisers, and all the members of that council were either great sages or brahmanas of the first order. They
did not accept any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. The state would get the best advice
without expenditure. They were themselves sama-darsi, equal to everyone, both man and animal. They
would not advise the king to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such
council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool's paradise. They were all self-realized
souls, and they knew perfectly well how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and
in the next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy.
They were philosophers in the real sense, and they knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all
these obligations, the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the king or executive
head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord, would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of
the state. The state in the days of Maharaja Yudhisthira or Maharaja Pariksit was a welfare state in the real
sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be he man or animal. Maharaja Pariksit was
an ideal king for a welfare state of the world.
