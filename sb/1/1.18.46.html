<h2>Translation</h2>
The Emperor Pariksit is a pious king. He is highly celebrated and is a first-class devotee of the
Personality of Godhead. He is a saint amongst royalty, and he has performed many horse sacrifices. When
such a king is tired and fatigued, being stricken with hunger and thirst, he does not at all deserve to be
cursed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After explaining the general codes relating to the royal position and asserting that the king can do no
wrong and therefore is never to be condemned, the sage Samika wanted to say something about Emperor
Pariksit specifically. The specific qualification of Maharaja Pariksit is summarized herein. The King, even
calculated as a king only, was most celebrated as a ruler who administered the religious principles of the
royal order. In the sastras the duties of all castes and orders of society are prescribed. All the qualities of a
ksatriya mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita (18.43) were present in the person of the Emperor. He was also a
great devotee of the Lord and a self-realized soul. Cursing such a king, when he was tired and fatigued
with hunger and thirst, was not at all proper. Samika Rsi thus admitted from all sides that Maharaja
Pariksit was cursed most unjustly. Although all the brahmanas were aloof from the incident, still for the
childish action of a brahmana boy the whole world situation was changed. Thus Rsi Samika, a brahmana,
took responsibility for all deterioration of the good orders of the world.
