bhrsam sudra-padahatam
vivatsam asru-vadanam
ksamam yavasam icchatim
SYNONYMS
gam--the cow; ca--also; dharma-dugham--beneficial because one can draw religion from her; dinam--
now rendered poor; bhrsam--distressed; sudra--the lower caste; pada-ahatam--beaten on the legs;
vivatsam--without any calf; asru-vadanam--with tears in her eyes; ksamam--very weak; yavasam--grass;
icchatim--as if desiring to have some grass to eat.
TRANSLATION
Although the cow is beneficial because one can draw religious principles from her, she was now
rendered poor and calfless. Her legs were being beaten by a sudra. There were tears in her eyes, and she
was distressed and weak. She was hankering after some grass in the field.
PURPORT
The next symptom of the age of Kali is the distressed condition of the cow. Milking the cow means
drawing the principles of religion in a liquid form. The great rsis and munis would live only on milk. Srila
Sukadeva Gosvami would go to a householder while he was milking a cow, and he would simply take a
little quantity of it for subsistence. Even fifty years ago, no one would deprive a sadhu of a quart or two of
milk, and every householder would give milk like water. For a Sanatanist (a follower of Vedic principles)
it is the duty of every householder to have cows and bulls as household paraphernalia, not only for
drinking milk, but also for deriving religious principles. The Sanatanist worships cows on religious
principles and respects brahmanas. The cow's milk is required for the sacrificial fire, and by performing
sacrifices the householder can be happy. The cow's calf not only is beautiful to look at, but also gives
satisfaction to the cow, and so she delivers as much milk as possible. But in the Kali-yuga, the calves are
separated from the cows as early as possible for purposes which may not be mentioned in these pages of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. The cow stands with tears in her eyes, the sudra milkman draws milk from the cow
artificially, and when there is no milk the cow is sent to be slaughtered. These greatly sinful acts are
responsible for all the troubles in present society. People do not know what they are doing in the name of
economic development. The influence of Kali will keep them in the darkness of ignorance. Despite all
endeavors for peace and prosperity, they must try to see the cows and the bulls happy in all respects.
Foolish people do not know how one earns happiness by making the cows and bulls happy, but it is a fact
by the law of nature. Let us take it from the authority of Srimad-Bhagavatam and adopt the principles for
the total happiness of humanity.
