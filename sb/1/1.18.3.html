<h2>Translation</h2>
Furthermore, after leaving all his associates, the King surrendered himself as a disciple to the son of
Vyasa [Sukadeva Gosvami], and thus he was able to understand the actual position of the Personality of
Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word ajita is significant here. The Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, is known as Ajita, or
unconquerable, and He is so in every respect. No one can know His actual position. He is unconquerable
by knowledge also. We have heard about His dhama, or place, eternal Goloka Vrndavana, but there are
many scholars who interpret this abode in different ways. But by the grace of a spiritual master like
Sukadeva Gosvami, unto whom the King gave himself up as a most humble disciple, one is able to
understand the actual position of the Lord, His eternal abode, and His transcendental paraphernalia in
that dhama, or abode. Knowing the transcendental position of the Lord and the transcendental method by
which one can approach that transcendental dhama, the King was confident about his ultimate
destination, and by knowing this he could leave aside everything material, even his own body, without
any difficulty of attachment. In the Bhagavad-gita, it is stated, param drstva nivartate: one can give up all
connection with material attachment when one is able to see the param, or the superior quality of things.
From Bhagavad-gita we understand the quality of the Lord's energy that is superior to the material quality
of energy, and by the grace of a bona fide spiritual master like Sukadeva Gosvami, it is quite possible to
know everything of the superior energy of the Lord by which the Lord manifests His eternal name,
quality, pastimes, paraphernalia and variegatedness. Unless one thoroughly understands this superior or
eternal energy of the Lord, it is not possible to leave the material energy, however one may theoretically
speculate on the true nature of the Absolute Truth. By the grace of Lord Krsna, Maharaja Pariksit was able
to receive the mercy of such a personality as Sukadeva Gosvami, and thus he was able to know the actual
position of the unconquerable Lord. It is very difficult to find the Lord from the Vedic literatures, but it is
very easy to know Him by the mercy of a liberated devotee like Sukadeva Gosvami.
