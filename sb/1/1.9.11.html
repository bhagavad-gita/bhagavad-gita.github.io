<h2>Translation</h2>
The sons of Maharaja Pandu were sitting silently nearby, overtaken with affection for their dying
grandfather. Seeing this, Bhismadeva congratulated them with feeling. There were tears of ecstasy in his
eyes, for he was overwhelmed by love and affection.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Maharaja Pandu died, his sons were all small children, and naturally they were brought up under
the affection of elderly members of the royal family, specifically by Bhismadeva. Later on, when the
Pandavas were grown up, they were cheated by cunning Duryodhana and company, and Bhismadeva,
although he knew that the Pandavas were innocent and were unnecessarily put into trouble, could not
take the side of the Pandavas for political reasons. At the last stage of his life, when Bhismadeva saw his
most exalted grandsons, headed by Maharaja Yudhisthira, sitting very gently at his side, the great warriorgrandfather
could not check his loving tears, which were automatically flowing from his eyes. He
remembered the great tribulations suffered by his most pious grandsons. Certainly he was the most
satisfied man because of Yudhisthira's being enthroned in place of Duryodhana, and thus he began to
congratulate them.
