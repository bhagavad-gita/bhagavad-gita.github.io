susenas carudesnas ca
sambo jambavati-sutah
anye ca karsni-pravarah
saputra rsabhadayah
SYNONYMS
susenah--Susena; carudesnah--Carudesna; ca--and; sambah--Samba; jambavati-sutah--the son of
Jambavati; anye--others; ca--also; karsni--the sons of Lord Krsna; pravarah--all chieftains; sa-putrah--along
with their sons; rsabha--Rsabha; adayah--etc.
TRANSLATION
Are all the chieftain sons of Lord Krsna, such as Susena, Carudesna, Samba the son of Jambavati, and
Rsabha, along with their sons, all doing well?
PURPORT
As already mentioned, Lord Krsna married 16,108 wives, and each of them had ten sons. Therefore
16,108 x 10 161,080 sons. They all grew up, and each of them had as many sons as their father, and the
whole aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The Lord is the father of all
living beings, who are countless in number; therefore only a few of them are called to associate with the
Lord in His transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dvaraka on this earth. It is not astonishing that the
Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many members. It is better to refrain from comparing the
Lord's position to ours, and it becomes a simple truth as soon as we understand at least a partial
calculation of the Lord's transcendental position. King Yudhisthira, while inquiring about the Lord's sons
and grandsons at Dvaraka, mentioned only the chieftains amongst them, for it was impossible for him to
remember all the names of the Lord's family members.

sunanda-nanda-sirsanya
ye canye satvatarsabhah

SYNONYMS
tatha eva--similarly; anucarah--constant companions; saureh--of Lord Sri Krsna such as; srutadeva--
Srutadeva; uddhava-adayah--Uddhava and others; sunanda--Sunanda; nanda--Nanda; sirsanyah--other
leaders; ye--all of them; ca--and; anye--others; satvata--liberated souls; rsabhah--the best men; api--if;
svasti--doing well; asate--are; sarve--all of them; rama--Balarama; krsna--Lord Krsna; bhuja-asrayah--
under the protection of; api--if also; smaranti--do remember; kusalam--welfare; asmakam--about
ourselves; baddha-sauhrdah--bound by eternal friendship.
TRANSLATION
Also, Srutadeva, Uddhava and others, Nanda, Sunanda and other leaders of liberated souls who are
constant companions of the Lord are protected by Lord Balarama and Krsna. Are they all doing well in
their respective functions? Do they, who are all eternally bound in friendship with us, remember our
welfare?
PURPORT
The constant companions of Lord Krsna, such as Uddhava, are all liberated souls, and they descended
along with Lord Krsna to this material world to fulfill the mission of the Lord. The Pandavas are also
liberated souls who descended along with Lord Krsna to serve Him in His transcendental pastimes on this
earth. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (4.8), the Lord and His eternal associates, who are also liberated
souls like the Lord, come down on this earth at certain intervals. The Lord remembers them all, but His
associates, although liberated souls, forget due to their being tatastha sakti, or marginal potency of the
Lord. That is the difference between the visnu-tattva and jiva-tattva. The jiva-tattvas are infinitesimal
potential particles of the Lord, and therefore they require the protection of the Lord at all times. And to
the eternal servitors of the Lord, the Lord is pleased to give all protection at all times. The liberated souls
never, therefore, think themselves as free as the Lord or as powerful as the Lord, but they always seek the
protection of the Lord in all circumstances, both in the material world and in the spiritual world. This
dependence of the liberated soul is constitutional, for the liberated souls are like sparks of a fire that are
able to exhibit the glow of fire along with the fire and not independently. Independently the glow of the
sparks is extinguished, although the quality of fire or the glowing is there. Thus those who give up the
protection of the Lord and become so-called lords themselves, out of spiritual ignorance, come back again
to this material world, even after prolonged tapasya of the severest type. That is the verdict of all Vedic
literature.
