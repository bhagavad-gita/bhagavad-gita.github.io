<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of his possessing spiritual assets, the doubts of duality were completely cut off. Thus he was
freed from the three modes of material nature and placed in transcendence. There was no longer any
chance of his becoming entangled in birth and death, for he was freed from material form.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Doubts of duality begin from the misconception of the material body, which is accepted as the self by
less intelligent persons. The most foolish part of our ignorance is our identifying this material body with
the self. Everything in relation with the body is ignorantly accepted as our own. Doubts due to
misconceptions of "myself" and "mine"--in other words, "my body," "my relatives," "my property," "my
wife," "my children," "my wealth," "my country," "my community," and hundreds and thousands of
similar illusory contemplations--cause bewilderment for the conditioned soul. By assimilating the
instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, one is sure to be released from such bewilderment because real
knowledge is knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, is everything,
including one's self. Everything is a manifestation of His potency as part and parcel. The potency and the
potent are nondifferent, so the conception of duality is at once mitigated by attainment of perfect
knowledge. As soon as Arjuna took up the instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, expert as he was, he could at
once eradicate the material conception of Lord Krsna, his eternal friend. He could realize that the Lord
was still present before him by His instruction, by His form, by His pastimes, by His qualities and
everything else related to Him. He could realize that Lord Krsna, his friend, was still present before him
by His transcendental presence in different nondual energies, and there was no question of attainment of
the association of the Lord by another change of body under the influence of time and space. By
attainment of absolute knowledge, one can be in association with the Lord constantly, even in this present
life, simply by hearing, chanting, thinking of and worshiping the Supreme Lord. One can see Him, one
can feel His presence even in this present life simply by understanding the advaya-jnana Lord, or the
Absolute Lord, through the process of devotional service, which begins with hearing about Him. Lord
Caitanya says that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one can at once wash off the dust on the
mirror of pure consciousness, and as soon as the dust is removed, one is at once freed from all material
conditions. To become free from material conditions means to liberate the soul. As soon as one is,
therefore, situated in absolute knowledge, his material conception of life is removed, or he emerges from a
false conception of life. Thus the function of the pure soul is revived in spiritual realization. This practical
realization of the living being is made possible due to his becoming free from the reaction of the three
modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance. By the grace of the Lord, a pure
devotee is at once raised to the place of the Absolute, and there is no chance of the devotee's becoming
materially entangled again in conditioned life. One is not able to feel the presence of the Lord in all
circumstances until one is endowed with the required transcendental vision made possible by devotional
service prescribed in the revealed scriptures. Arjuna had attained this stage long before on the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra, and when he apparently felt the absence of the Lord, he at once took shelter of the
instructions of the Bhagavad-gita, and thus again he was placed in his original position. This is the
position of visoka, or the stage of being freed from all grief and anxieties.
