<h2>Translation</h2>
Your respectable younger brother, who possesses the strength of ten thousand elephants, killed, by His
grace, Jarasandha, whose feet were worshiped by many kings. These kings had been brought for sacrifice
in Jarasandha's Mahabhairava-yajna, but they were thus released. Later they paid tribute to Your Majesty.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Jarasandha was a very powerful king of Magadha, and the history of his birth and activities is also very
interesting. His father, King Brhadratha, was also a very prosperous and powerful king of Magadha, but he
had no son, although he married two daughters of the King of Kasi. Being disappointed in not getting a
son from either of the two queens, the King, along with his wives, left home to live in the forest for
austerities, but in the forest he was blessed by one great rsi to have a son, and he gave him one mango to
be eaten by the queens. The queens did so and were very soon pregnant. The King was very happy to see
the queens bearing children, but when the ripe time approached, the queens delivered one child in two
parts, one from each of the queens' wombs. The two parts were thrown in the forest, where a great shedemon
used to live, and she was glad to have some delicate flesh and blood from the newly born child.
Out of curiosity she joined the two parts, and the child became complete and regained life. The shedemon
was known as Jara, and being compassionate on the childless King, she went to the King and
presented him with the nice child, The King was very pleased with the she-demon and wanted to reward
her according to her desire. The she-demon expressed her desire that the child be named after her, and
thus the child was surnamed Jarasandha, or one who was joined by Jara, the she-demon. In fact, this
Jarasandha was born as one of the parts and parcels of the demon Vipracitti. The saint by whose
benedictions the queens bore the child was called Candra Kausika, who foretold of the child before his
father Brhadratha.
Since he possessed demoniac qualities from birth, naturally he became a great devotee of Lord Siva, who
is the lord of all ghostly and demoniac men. Ravana was a great devotee of Lord Siva, and so also King
Jarasandha. He used to sacrifice all arrested kings before Lord Mahabhairava (Siva) and by his military
power he defeated many small kings and arrested them to butcher before Mahabhairava. There are many
devotees of Lord Mahabhairava, or Kalabhairava, in the province of Bihar, formerly called Magadha.
Jarasandha was a relative of Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krsna, and therefore after Kamsa's death King
Jarasandha became a great enemy of Krsna, and there were many fights between Jarasandha and Krsna.
Lord Krsna wanted to kill him, but He also wanted that those who served as military men for Jarasandha
might not be killed. Therefore a plan was adopted to kill him. Krsna, Bhima and Arjuna together went to
Jarasandha in the dress of poor brahmanas and begged charity from King Jarasandha. Jarasandha never
refused charity to any brahmana, and he performed many sacrifices also, yet he was not on a par with
devotional service. Lord Krsna, Bhima and Arjuna asked Jarasandha for the facility of fighting him, and it
was settled that Jarasandha would fight with Bhima only. So all of them were both guests and combatants
of Jarasandha, and Bhima and Jarasandha fought every day for several days. Bhima became disappointed,
but Krsna gave him hints about Jarasandha's being joined together as an infant, and thus Bhima dissected
him again and so killed him. All the kings who were detained in the concentration camp to be killed
before Mahabhairava were thus released by Bhima. Feeling thus obliged to the Pandavas, they paid tribute
to King Yudhisthira.
