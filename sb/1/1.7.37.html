<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A cruel and wretched person who maintains his existence at the cost of others' lives deserves to be killed
for his own well-being, otherwise he will go down by his own actions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A life for a life is just punishment for a person who cruelly and shamelessly lives at the cost of another's
life. Political morality is to punish a person by a death sentence in order to save a cruel person from going
to hell. That a murderer is condemned to a death sentence by the state is good for the culprit because in
his next life he will not have to suffer for his act of murder. Such a death sentence for the murderer is the
lowest possible punishment offered to him, and it is said in the smrti-sastras that men who are punished
by the king on the principle of a life for a life are purified of all their sins, so much so that they may be
eligible for being promoted to the planets of heaven. According to Manu, the great author of civic codes
and religious principles, even the killer of an animal is to be considered a murderer because animal food is
never meant for the civilized man, whose prime duty is to prepare himself for going back to Godhead. He
says that in the act of killing an animal, there is a regular conspiracy by the party of sinners, and all of
them are liable to be punished as murderers exactly like a party of conspirators who kill a human being
combinedly. He who gives permission, he who kills the animal, he who sells the slaughtered animal, he
who cooks the animal, he who administers distribution of the foodstuff, and at last he who eats such
cooked animal food are all murderers, and all of them are liable to be punished by the laws of nature. No
one can create a living being despite all advancement of material science, and therefore no one has the
right to kill a living being by one's independent whims. For the animal-eaters, the scriptures have
sanctioned restricted animal sacrifices only, and such sanctions are there just to restrict the opening of
slaughterhouses and not to encourage animal-killing. The procedure under which animal sacrifice is
allowed in the scriptures is good both for the animal sacrificed and the animal-eaters. It is good for the
animal in the sense that the sacrificed animal is at once promoted to the human form of life after being
sacrificed at the altar, and the animal-eater is saved from grosser types of sins (eating meats supplied by
organized slaughterhouses which are ghastly places for breeding all kinds of material afflictions to society,
country and the people in general). The material world is itself a place always full of anxieties, and by
encouraging animal slaughter the whole atmosphere becomes polluted more and more by war, pestilence,
famine and many other unwanted calamities.
