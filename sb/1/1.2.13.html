<h2>Translation</h2>
O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by
discharging the duties prescribed for one's own occupation according to caste divisions and orders of life
is to please the Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Human society all over the world is divided into four castes and four orders of life. The four castes are
the intelligent caste, the martial caste, the productive caste and the laborer caste. These castes are
classified in terms of one's work and qualification and not by birth. Then again there are four orders of
life, namely the student life, the householder's life, the retired and the devotional life. In the best interest
of human society there must be such divisions of life, otherwise no social institution can grow in a healthy
state. And in each and every one of the abovementioned divisions of life, the aim must be to please the
supreme authority of the Personality of Godhead. This institutional function of human society is known
as the system of varnasrama-dharma, which is quite natural for the civilized life. The varnasrama
institution is constructed to enable one to realize the Absolute Truth. It is not for artificial domination of
one division over another. When the aim of life, i.e., realization of the Absolute Truth, is missed by too
much attachment for indriya-priti, or sense gratification, as already discussed hereinbefore, the institution
of the varnasrama is utilized by selfish men to pose an artificial predominance over the weaker section. In
the Kali-yuga, or in the age of quarrel, this artificial predominance is already current, but the saner section
of the people know it well that the divisions of castes and orders of life are meant for smooth social
intercourse and high-thinking self-realization and not for any other purpose.
Herein the statement of Bhagavatam is that the highest aim of life or the highest perfection of the
institution of the varnasrama-dharma is to cooperate jointly for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. This
is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (4.13).
