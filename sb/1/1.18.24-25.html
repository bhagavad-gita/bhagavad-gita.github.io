<h2>Translation</h2>
Once upon a time Maharaja Pariksit, while engaged in hunting in the forest with bow and arrows,
became extremely fatigued, hungry and thirsty while following the stags. While searching for a reservoir
of water, he entered the hermitage of the well-known Samika Rsi and saw the sage sitting silently with
closed eyes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord is so kind to His pure devotees that in proper time He calls such devotees up to Him
and thus creates an auspicious circumstance for the devotee. Maharaja Pariksit was a pure devotee of the
Lord, and there was no reason for him to become extremely fatigued, hungry and thirsty because a
devotee of the Lord never becomes perturbed by such bodily demands. But by the desire of the Lord, even
such a devotee can become apparently fatigued and thirsty just to create a situation favorable for his
renunciation of worldly activities. One has to give up all attachment for worldly relations before one is
able to go back to Godhead, and thus when a devotee is too much absorbed in worldly affairs, the Lord
creates a situation to cause indifference. The Supreme Lord never forgets His pure devotee, even though
he may be engaged in so-called worldly affairs. Sometimes He creates an awkward situation, and the
devotee becomes obliged to renounce all worldly affairs. The devotee can understand by the signal of the
Lord, but others take it to be unfavorable and frustrating. Maharaja Pariksit was to become the medium
for the revelation of Srimad-Bhagavatam by Lord Sri Krsna, as his grandfather Arjuna was the medium for
the Bhagavad-gita. Had Arjuna not been taken up with an illusion of family affection by the will of the
Lord, the Bhagavad-gita would not have been spoken by the Lord Himself for the good of all concerned.
Similarly, had Maharaja Pariksit not been fatigued, hungry and thirsty at this time, Srimad-Bhagavatam
would not have been spoken by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, the prime authority of Srimad-Bhagavatam. So
this is a prelude to the circumstances under which Srimad-Bhagavatam was spoken for the benefit of all
concerned. The prelude, therefore, begins with the words "once upon a time."
