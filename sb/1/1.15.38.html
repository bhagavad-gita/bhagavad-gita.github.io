TRANSLATION
The great heroes of the Yadu dynasty, being protected by the arms of Lord Sri Krsna, always remain
fearless in every respect. And therefore their feet trample over the Sudharma assembly house, which the
best demigods deserved but which was taken away from them.
PURPORT
Those who are directly servitors of the Lord are protected by the Lord from all fearfulness, and they also
enjoy the best of things, even if they are forcibly accumulated. The Lord is equal in behavior to all living
beings, but He is partial to His pure devotees, being very affectionate toward them. The city of Dvaraka
was flourishing, being enriched with the best of things in the material world. The state assembly house is
constructed according to the dignity of the particular state. In the heavenly planets, the state assembly
house called Sudharma was deserving of the dignity of the best of the demigods. Such an assembly house
is never meant for any state on the globe because the human being on the earth is unable to construct it,
however far a particular state may be materially advanced. But during the time of Lord Krsna's presence
on the earth, the members of the Yadu family forcibly brought the celestial assembly house to earth and
placed it at Dvaraka. They were able to use such force because they were certain of the indulgence and
protection of the Supreme Lord Krsna. In other words, the Lord is provided with the best things in the
universe by His pure devotees. Lord Krsna was provided with all kinds of comforts and facilities available
within the universe by the members of the Yadu dynasty, and in return such servitors of the Lord were
protected and fearless.
A forgetful, conditioned soul is fearful. But a liberated soul is never fearful, just as a small child
completely dependent on the mercy of his father is never fearful of anyone. Fearfulness is a sort of illusion
for the living being when he is in slumber and forgetting his eternal relation with the Lord. Since the
living being is never to die by his constitution, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.20), then what is the cause of
fearfulness? A person may be fearful of a tiger in a dream, but another man who is awake by his side sees
no tiger there. The tiger is a myth for both of them, namely the person dreaming and the person awake,
because actually there is no tiger; but the man forgetful of his awakened life is fearful, whereas the man
who has not forgotten his position is not at all fearful. Thus the members of the Yadu dynasty were fully
awake in their service to the Lord, and therefore there was no tiger for them to be afraid of at any time.
Even if there were a real tiger, the Lord was there to protect them.
