<h2>Text</h2>
sva-rat pautram vinayinam
atmanah susamam gunaih
toya-nivyah patim bhumer
abhyasincad gajahvaye
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sva-rat--the emperor; pautram--unto the grandson; vinayinam--properly trained; atmanah--his own self;
su-samam--equal in all respects; gunaih--by the qualities; toya-nivyah--bordered by the seas; patim--
master; bhumeh--of the land; abhyasincat--enthroned; gajahvaye--in the capital of Hastinapura.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, in the capital of Hastinapura, he enthroned his grandson, who was trained and equally
qualified, as the emperor and master of all land bordered by the seas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The total land on the earth bordered by the seas was under the subjugation of the King of Hastinapura.
Maharaja Yudhisthira trained his grandson, Maharaja Pariksit, who was equally qualified, in state
administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens. Thus Pariksit was enthroned on the seat of
Maharaja Yudhisthira prior to his departure back to Godhead. Concerning Maharaja Pariksit, the specific
word used, vinayinam, is significant. Why was the King of Hastinapura, at least till the time of Maharaja
Pariksit, accepted as the Emperor of the world? The only reason is that the people of the world were
happy because of the good administration of the emperor. The happiness of the citizens was due to the
ample production of natural produce such as grains, fruits, milk, herbs, valuable stones, minerals and
everything that the people needed. They were even free from all bodily miseries, anxieties of mind, and
disturbances caused by natural phenomena and other living beings. Because everyone was happy in all
respects, there was no resentment, although there were sometimes battles between the state kings for
political reasons and supremacy. Everyone was trained to attain the highest goal of life, and therefore the
people were also enlightened enough not to quarrel over trivialities. The influence of the age of Kali
gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizens, and therefore a tense situation
developed between the ruler and the ruled, but still even in this age of disparity between the ruler and the
ruled, there can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness. That is a special prerogative.
