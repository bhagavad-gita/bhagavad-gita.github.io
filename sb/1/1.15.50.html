<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
draupadi ca tadajnaya
patinam anapeksatam
vasudeve bhagavati
hy ekanta-matir apa tam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
draupadi--Draupadi (the wife of the Pandavas); ca--and; tada--at that time; ajnaya--knowing Lord Krsna
fully well; patinam--of the husbands; anapeksatam--who did not care for her; vasudeve--unto Lord
Vasudeva (Krsna); bhagavati--the personality of Godhead; hi--exactly; eka-anta--absolutely; matih--
concentration; apa--got; tam--Him (the Lord).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Draupadi also saw that her husbands, without caring for her, were leaving home. She knew well about
Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. Both she and Subhadra became absorbed in thoughts
of Krsna and attained the same results as their husbands.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When flying an airplane, one cannot take care of other planes. Everyone has to take care of his own
plane, and if there is any danger, no other plane can help another in that condition. Similarly, at the end
of life, when one has to go back home, back to Godhead, everyone has to take care of himself without
help rendered by another. The help is, however, offered on the ground before flying in space. Similarly,
the spiritual master, the father, the mother, the relatives, the husband and others can all render help
during one's lifetime, but while crossing the sea one has to take care of himself and utilize the instructions
formerly received. Draupadi had five husbands, and no one asked Draupadi to come; Draupadi had to take
care of herself without waiting for her great husbands. And because she was already trained, she at once
took to concentration upon the lotus feet of Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. The wives
also got the same result as their husbands, in the same manner; that is to say, without changing their
bodies they reached the destination of Godhead. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura suggests that both
Draupadi and Subhadra, although her name is not mentioned herein, got the same result. None of them
had to quit the body.
