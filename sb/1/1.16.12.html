Maharaja Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet--Bhadrasva, Ketumala, Bharata, the

<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhadrasva: It is a tract of land near Meru Parvata, and it extends from Gandha-madana Parvata to the
saltwater ocean. There is a description of this varsa in the Mahabharata (Bhisma-parva 7.14-18). The
description was narrated by Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra.
Maharaja Yudhisthira also conquered this varsa, and thus the province was included within the
jurisdiction of his empire. Maharaja Pariksit was formerly declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by
his grandfather, but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital to exact tribute
from such states.
Ketumala: This earth planet is divided into seven dvipas by seven oceans, and the central dvipa, called
Jambudvipa, is divided into nine varsas, or parts, by eight huge mountains. Bharata-varsa is one of the
above-mentioned nine varsas, and Ketumala is also described as one of the above varsas. It is said that in
Ketumala varsa, women are the most beautiful. This varsa was conquered by Arjuna also. A description of
this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata (Sabha 28.6).
It is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of the Meru Parvata, and inhabitants
of this province used to live up to ten thousand years (Bhisma-parva 6.31). Human beings living in this
part of the globe are of golden color, and the women resemble the angels of heaven. The inhabitants are
free from all kinds of diseases and grief.
Bharata-varsa: This part of the world is also one of the nine varsas of the Jambudvipa. A description of
Bharata-varsa is given in the Mahabharata (Bhisma-parva, Chapters 9 and 10).
In the center of Jambudvipa is Ilavrta-varsa, and south of Ilavrta-varsa is Hari-varsa. The description of
these varsas is given in the Mahabharata (Sabha-parva 28.7-8) as follows:
nagarams ca vanams caiva
nadis ca vimalodakah
purusan deva-kalpams ca
naris ca priya-darsanah
adrsta-purvan subhagan
sa dadarsa dhananjayah
sadanani ca subhrani
naris capsarasam nibhah
It is mentioned here that the women in both these varsas are beautiful, and some of them are equal to
the Apsaras, or heavenly women.
Uttarakuru: According to Vedic geography the northernmost portion of Jambudvipa is called
Uttarakuru-varsa. It is surrounded by the saltwater ocean from three sides and divided by Srngavan
Mountain from the Hiranmaya-varsa.
Kimpurusa-varsa: It is stated to be situated north of the great Himalaya Mountain, which is eighty
thousand miles in length and height and which covers sixteen thousand miles in width. These parts of the
world were also conquered by Arjuna (Sabha 28.1-2). The Kimpurusas are descendants of a daughter of
Daksa. When Maharaja Yudhisthira performed a horse sacrifice yajna, the inhabitants of these countries
were also present to take part in the festival, and they paid tributes to the Emperor. This part of the world
is called Kimpurusa-varsa, or sometimes the Himalayan provinces (Himavati). It is said that Sukadeva
Gosvami was born in these Himalayan provinces and that he came to Bharata-varsa after crossing the
Himalayan countries.
In other words, Maharaja Pariksit conquered all the world. He conquered all the continents adjoining all
the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the
world.
