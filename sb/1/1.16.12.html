bhadrasvam ketumalam ca
bharatam cottaran kurun
kimpurusadini varsani
vijitya jagrhe balim
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhadrasvam--Bhadrasva; ketumalam--Ketumala; ca--also; bharatam--Bharata; ca--and; uttaran--the
northern countries; kurun--the kingdom of the Kuru dynasty; kimpurusa-adini--a country beyond the
northern side of the Himalayas; varsani--parts of the earth planet; vijitya--conquering; jagrhe--exacted;
balim--strength.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit then conquered all parts of the earthly planet--Bhadrasva, Ketumala, Bharata, the
northern Kuru, Kimpurusa, etc.--and exacted tributes from their respective rulers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhadrasva: It is a tract of land near Meru Parvata, and it extends from Gandha-madana Parvata to the
saltwater ocean. There is a description of this varsa in the Mahabharata (Bhisma-parva 7.14-18). The
description was narrated by Sanjaya to Dhrtarastra.
Maharaja Yudhisthira also conquered this varsa, and thus the province was included within the
jurisdiction of his empire. Maharaja Pariksit was formerly declared to be the emperor of all lands ruled by
his grandfather, but still he had to establish his supremacy while he was out of his capital to exact tribute
from such states.
Ketumala: This earth planet is divided into seven dvipas by seven oceans, and the central dvipa, called
Jambudvipa, is divided into nine varsas, or parts, by eight huge mountains. Bharata-varsa is one of the
above-mentioned nine varsas, and Ketumala is also described as one of the above varsas. It is said that in
Ketumala varsa, women are the most beautiful. This varsa was conquered by Arjuna also. A description of
this part of the world is available in the Mahabharata (Sabha 28.6).
It is said that this part of the world is situated on the western side of the Meru Parvata, and inhabitants
of this province used to live up to ten thousand years (Bhisma-parva 6.31). Human beings living in this
part of the globe are of golden color, and the women resemble the angels of heaven. The inhabitants are
free from all kinds of diseases and grief.
Bharata-varsa: This part of the world is also one of the nine varsas of the Jambudvipa. A description of
Bharata-varsa is given in the Mahabharata (Bhisma-parva, Chapters 9 and 10).
In the center of Jambudvipa is Ilavrta-varsa, and south of Ilavrta-varsa is Hari-varsa. The description of
these varsas is given in the Mahabharata (Sabha-parva 28.7-8) as follows:
nagarams ca vanams caiva
nadis ca vimalodakah
purusan deva-kalpams ca
naris ca priya-darsanah
adrsta-purvan subhagan
sa dadarsa dhananjayah
sadanani ca subhrani
naris capsarasam nibhah
It is mentioned here that the women in both these varsas are beautiful, and some of them are equal to
the Apsaras, or heavenly women.
Uttarakuru: According to Vedic geography the northernmost portion of Jambudvipa is called
Uttarakuru-varsa. It is surrounded by the saltwater ocean from three sides and divided by Srngavan
Mountain from the Hiranmaya-varsa.
Kimpurusa-varsa: It is stated to be situated north of the great Himalaya Mountain, which is eighty
thousand miles in length and height and which covers sixteen thousand miles in width. These parts of the
world were also conquered by Arjuna (Sabha 28.1-2). The Kimpurusas are descendants of a daughter of
Daksa. When Maharaja Yudhisthira performed a horse sacrifice yajna, the inhabitants of these countries
were also present to take part in the festival, and they paid tributes to the Emperor. This part of the world
is called Kimpurusa-varsa, or sometimes the Himalayan provinces (Himavati). It is said that Sukadeva
Gosvami was born in these Himalayan provinces and that he came to Bharata-varsa after crossing the
Himalayan countries.
In other words, Maharaja Pariksit conquered all the world. He conquered all the continents adjoining all
the seas and oceans in all directions, namely the eastern, western, northern and southern parts of the
world.

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Wherever the King visited, he continuously heard the glories of his great forefathers, who were all
devotees of the Lord, and also of the glorious acts of Lord Krsna. He also heard how he himself had been
protected by the Lord from the powerful heat of the weapon of Asvatthama. People also mentioned the
great affection between the descendants of Vrsni and Prtha due to the latter's great devotion to Lord
Kesava. The King, being very pleased with the singers of such glories, opened his eyes in great
satisfaction. Out of magnanimity he was pleased to award them very valuable necklaces and clothing.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses. This is a system from
time immemorial, and Maharaja Pariksit, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was
also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. The subject
matter of those welcome addresses was Krsna. Krsna means Krsna and His eternal devotees, as the king
means the king and his confidential associates.
Krsna and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore glorifying the devotee means
glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Maharaja Pariksit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of
his forefathers like Maharaja Yudhisthira and Arjuna had they not been connected with the acts of Lord
Krsna. The Lord descends specifically to deliver His devotees (paritranaya sadhunam). The devotees are
glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the
Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore
Maharaja Pariksit felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially when he was
saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees of the Lord are never in danger, but in the
material world which is full of dangers at every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous
positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified. Lord Krsna would not have been
glorified as the speaker of the Bhagavad-gita had His devotees like the Pandavas not been entangled in the
Battlefield of Kuruksetra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the addresses of welcome, and
Maharaja Pariksit, in full satisfaction, rewarded those who presented such addresses. The difference
between the presentation of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the welcome
addresses were presented to a person like Maharaja Pariksit. The welcome addresses were full of facts and
figures, and those who presented such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days
the welcome addresses are presented not always with factual statements but to please the postholder, and
often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by
the poor receiver.
