evam grhesu saktanam
pramattanam tad-ihaya
atyakramad avijnatah
kalah parama-dustarah
SYNONYMS
evam--thus; grhesu--in the family affairs; saktanam--of persons who are too attached; pramattanam--
insanely attached; tat-ihaya--engrossed in such thoughts; atyakramat--surpassed; avijnatah--imperceptibly;
kalah--eternal time; parama--supremely; dustarah--insurmountable.
TRANSLATION
Insurmountable, eternal time imperceptibly overcomes those who are too much attached to family
affairs and are always engrossed in their thought.
PURPORT
"I am now happy; I have everything in order; my bank balance is quite enough; I can now give my
children enough estate; I am now successful; the poor beggar sannyasis depend on God, but they come to
beg from me; therefore I am more than the Supreme God." These are some of the thoughts which engross
the insanely attached householder who is blind to the passing of eternal time. Our duration of life is
measured, and no one is able to enhance it even by a second against the scheduled time ordained by the
supreme will. Such valuable time, especially for the human being, should be cautiously spent because
even a second passed away imperceptibly cannot be replaced, even in exchange for thousands of golden
coins amassed by hard labor. Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the
problems of life, i.e. repetition of birth and death and revolving in the cycle of 8,400,000 different species
of life. The material body, which is subject to birth and death, diseases and old age, is the cause of all
sufferings of the living being, otherwise the living being is eternal; he is never born, nor does he ever die.
Foolish persons forget this problem. They do not know at all how to solve the problems of life, but
become engrossed in temporary family affairs not knowing that eternal time is passing away imperceptibly
and that their measured duration of life is diminishing every second, without any solution to the big
problem, namely repetition of birth and death, disease and old age. This is called illusion.
But such illusion cannot work on one who is awake in the devotional service of the Lord. Yudhisthira
Maharaja and his brothers the Pandavas were all engaged in the service of the Lord Sri Krsna, and they
had very little attraction for the illusory happiness of this material world. As we have discussed
previously, Maharaja Yudhisthira was fixed in the service of the Lord Mukunda (the Lord, who can award
salvation), and therefore he had no attraction even for such comforts of life as are available in the
kingdom of heaven, because even the happiness obtained on the planet Brahmaloka is also temporary and
illusory. Because the living being is eternal, he can be happy only in the eternal abode of the kingdom of
God (paravyoma), from which no one returns to this region of repeated birth and death, disease and old
age. Therefore, any comfort of life or any material happiness which does not warrant an eternal life is but
illusion for the eternal living being. One who understands this factually is learned, and such a learned
person can sacrifice any amount of material happiness to achieve the desired goal known as brahmasukham,
or absolute happiness. Real transcendentalists are hungry for this happiness, and as a hungry
man cannot be made happy by all comforts of life minus foodstuff, so the man hungry for eternal absolute
happiness cannot be satisfied by any amount of material happiness. Therefore, the instruction described
in this verse cannot be applied to Maharaja Yudhisthira or his brothers and mother. It was meant for
persons like Dhrtarastra, for whom Vidura came especially to impart lessons.
