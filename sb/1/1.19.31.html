<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage Sri Sukadeva Gosvami sat perfectly pacified, intelligent and ready to answer any question
without hesitation. The great devotee, Maharaja Pariksit, approached him, offered his respects by bowing
before him, and politely inquired with sweet words and folded hands.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The gesture now adopted by Maharaja Pariksit of questioning a master is quite befitting in terms of
scriptural injunctions. The scriptural injunction is that one should humbly approach a spiritual master to
understand the transcendental science. Maharaja Pariksit was now prepared for meeting his death, and
within the very short time of seven days he was to know the process of entering the kingdom of God. In
such important cases, one is required to approach a spiritual master. There is no necessity of approaching
a spiritual master unless one is in need of solving the problems of life. One who does not know how to
put questions before the spiritual master has no business seeing him. And the qualification of the spiritual
master is perfectly manifested in the person of Sukadeva Gosvami. Both the spiritual master and the
disciple, namely Sri Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja Pariksit, attained perfection through the medium of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Sukadeva Gosvami learned Srimad-Bhagavatam from his father, Vyasadeva, but he
had no chance to recite it. Before Maharaja Pariksit he recited Srimad-Bhagavatam and answered the
questions of Maharaja Pariksit unhesitatingly, and thus both the master and the disciple got salvation.
