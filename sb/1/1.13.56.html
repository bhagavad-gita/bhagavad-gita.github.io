<h2>Text</h2>
dhvasta-maya-gunodarko
niruddha-karanasayah
nivartitakhilahara
aste sthanur ivacalah
tasyantarayo maivabhuh
sannyastakhila-karmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dhvasta--being destroyed; maya-guna--the modes of material nature; udarkah--after effects; niruddha--
being suspended; karana-asayah--the senses and the mind; nivartita--stopped; akhila--all; aharah--food for
the senses; aste--is sitting; sthanuh--immovable; iva--like; acalah--fixed; tasya--his; antarayah--hindrances;
ma eva--never like that; abhuh--be; sannyasta--renounced; akhila--all sorts; karmanah--material duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He will have to suspend all the actions of the senses, even from the outside, and will have to be
impervious to interactions of the senses, which are influenced by the modes of material nature. After
renouncing all material duties, he must become immovably established, beyond all sources of hindrances
on the path.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Dhrtarastra had attained, by the yogic process, the stage of negation of all sorts of material reaction. The
effects of the material modes of nature draw the victim to indefatigable desires of enjoying matter, but one
can escape such false enjoyment by the yogic process. Every sense is always busy in searching for its food,
and thus the conditioned soul is assaulted from all sides and has no chance to become steady in any
pursuit. Maharaja Yudhisthira was advised by Narada not to disturb his uncle by attempting to bring him
back home. He was now beyond the attraction of anything material. The material modes of nature (the
gunas) have their different modes of activities, but above the material modes of nature is a spiritual mode,
which is absolute. Nirguna means without reaction. The spiritual mode and its effect are identical;
therefore the spiritual quality is distinguished from its material counterpart by the word nirguna. After
complete suspension of the material modes of nature, one is admitted to the spiritual sphere, and action
dictated by the spiritual modes is called devotional service, or bhakti. Bhakti is therefore nirguna attained
by direct contact with the Absolute.
