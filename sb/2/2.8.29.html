<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
yad yat pariksid rsabhah
pandunam anuprcchati
anupurvyena tat sarvam
akhyatum upacakrame
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat yat--whatsoever; pariksit--the King; rsabhah--the best; pandunam--in the dynasty of Pandu;
anuprcchati--goes on inquiring; anupurvyena--the beginning to the end; tat--all those; sarvam--fully;
akhyatum--to describe; upacakrame--he just prepared himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He also prepared himself to reply to all that King Pariksit had inquired from him. Maharaja Pariksit was
the best in the dynasty of the Pandus, and thus he was able to ask the right questions from the right
person.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit asked many questions, some of them very curiously, to know things as they are, but it
is not necessary for the master to answer them in the order of the disciple's inquiries, one after the other.
But Sukadeva Gosvami, experienced teacher that he was, answered all the questions in a systematic way as
they were received from the chain of disciplic succession. And he answered all of them without exception.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Questions by King Pariksit."
