<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
etavan sankhya-yogabhyam
sva-dharma-parinisthaya
janma-labhah parah pumsam
ante narayana-smrtih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etavan--all these; sankhya--complete knowledge of matter and spirit; yogabhyam--knowledge of mystic
power; sva-dharma--particular occupational duty; parinisthaya--by full perception; janma--birth; labhah--
gain; parah--the supreme; pumsam--of a person; ante--at the end; narayana--the Personality of Godhead;
smrtih--remembrance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by
practice of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of occupational duty, is to remember the Personality of
Godhead at the end of life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narayana is the transcendental Personality of Godhead beyond the material creation. Everything that is
created, sustained, and at the end annihilated is within the compass of the mahat-tattva (material
principle) and is known as the material world. The existence of Narayana, or the Personality of Godhead,
is not within the jurisdiction of this mahat-tattva, and as such, the name, form, attributes, etc. of Narayana
are beyond the jurisdiction of the material world. By the speculation of empiric philosophy, which
discerns matter from spirit, or by cultivation of mystic powers, which ultimately helps the performer to
reach any planet of the universe or beyond the universe, or by discharge of religious duties, one can
achieve the highest perfection, provided one is able to reach the stage of narayana-smrti, or constant
remembrance of the Personality of Godhead. This is possible only by the association of a pure devotee,
who can give a finishing touch to the transcendental activities of all jnanis, yogis, or karmis, in terms of
prescribed duties defined in the scriptures. There are many historical instances of the achievement of
spiritual perfection, such as that of the Sanakadi Rsis or the nine celebrated Yogendras, who attained
perfection only after being situated in the devotional service of the Lord. None of the devotees of the Lord
ever deviated from the path of devotional service by taking to other methods as adopted by the jnanis or
yogis. Everyone is anxious to achieve the highest perfection of his particular activity, and it is indicated
herein that such perfection is narayana-smrti, for which everyone must endeavor his best. In other words,
life should be molded in such a manner that one is able to progressively remember the personality of
Godhead in every step of life.
