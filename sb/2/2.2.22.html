<h2>Translation</h2>
However, O King, if a yogi maintains a desire for improved material enjoyments, like transference to the
topmost planet, Brahmaloka, or the achievement of the eightfold perfections, travel in outer space with
the Vaihayasas, or a situation in one of the millions of planets, then he has to take away with him the
materially molded mind and senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the upper status of the planetary systems there are facilities thousands and thousands of times greater
for material enjoyments than in the lower planetary systems. The topmost planetary systems consist of
planets like Brahmaloka and Dhruvaloka (the polestar), and all of them are situated beyond Maharloka.
The inhabitants of those planets are empowered with eightfold achievements of mystic perfection. They
do not have to learn and practice the mystic processes of yoga perfection and achieve the power of
becoming small like a particle (anima-siddhi), or lighter than a soft feather (laghima-siddhi). They do not
have to get anything and everything from anywhere and everywhere (prapti-siddhi), to become heavier
than the heaviest (mahima-siddhi), to act freely even to create something wonderful or to annihilate
anything at will (isitva-siddhi), to control all material elements (vasitva-siddhi), to possess such power as
will never be frustrated in any desire (prakamya-siddhi), or to assume any shape or form one may even
whimsically desire (kamavasayita-siddhi). All these expediencies are as common as natural gifts for the
inhabitants of those higher planets. They do not require any mechanical help to travel in outer space, and
they can move and travel at will from one planet to any other planet within no time. The inhabitants of
the earth cannot move even to the nearest planet except by mechanical vehicles like spacecraft, but the
highly talented inhabitants of such higher planets can do everything very easily.
Since a materialist is generally inquisitive to experience what is actually in such planetary systems, he
wants to see everything personally. As inquisitive persons tour all over the world to gain direct local
experience, the less intelligent transcendentalist similarly desires to have some experience of those planets
about which he has heard so many wonderful things. The yogi can, however, easily fulfill his desire by
going there with the present materialistic mind and senses. The prime inclination of the materialistic
mind is to lord it over the material world, and all the siddhis mentioned above are features of domination
over the world. The devotees of the Lord are not ambitious to dominate a false and temporary
phenomenon. On the contrary, a devotee wants to be dominated by the supreme predominator, the Lord.
A desire to serve the Lord, the supreme predominator, is spiritual or transcendental, and one has to attain
this purification of the mind and the senses to get admission into the spiritual kingdom. With the
materialistic mind one can reach the best planet in the universe, but no one can enter into the kingdom of
God. Senses are called spiritually purified when they are not involved in sense gratification. Senses require
engagements, and when the senses are engaged totally in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,
they have no chance to become contaminated by material infections.
