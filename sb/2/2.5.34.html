udake--in the causal water; sayam--being drowned; kala--eternal time; karma--action; svabhava-sthah--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus all the universes remained thousands of eons within the water [the Causal Ocean], and the Lord of
living beings, entering in each of them, caused them to be fully animated.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is described here as the jiva because He is the leader of all other jivas (living entities). In the
Vedas He is described as the nitya, the leader of all other nityas. The Lord's relation with the living entities
is like that of the father with the sons. The sons and the father are qualitatively equal, but the father is
never the son, nor is the son ever the father who begets. So, as described above, the Lord as
Garbhodakasayi Visnu or Hiranyagarbha Supersoul enters into each and every universe and causes it to be
animated by begetting the living entities within the womb of the material nature, as confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita (14.3). After each annihilation of the material creation, all the living entities are merged
within the body of the Lord, and after creation they are again impregnated within the material energy. In
material existence, therefore, the material energy is seemingly the mother of the living entities, and the
Lord is the father. When, however, the animation takes place, the living entities revive their own natural
activities under the spell of time and energy, and thus the varieties of living beings are manifested. The
Lord, therefore, is ultimately the cause of all animation in the material world.
