<h2>Text</h2>
gunatmakanindriyani
bhutadi-prabhava gunah
manah sarva-vikaratma
buddhir vijnana-rupini
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
guna-atmakani--attached to the qualities; indriyani--the senses; bhuta-adi--material ego; prabhavah--
influenced by; gunah--the modes of material nature; manah--the mind; sarva--all; vikara--affection
(happiness and distress); atma--form; buddhih--intelligence; vijnana--deliberation; rupini--featuring.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sense organs are attached to the modes of material nature, and the modes of material nature are
products of the false ego. The mind is subjected to all kinds of material experiences (happiness and
distress), and the intelligence is the feature of the mind's deliberation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Illusioned by the material nature, the living entity identifies with false ego. More clearly, when the living
entity is entrapped by the material body, he at once identifies with the bodily relationships, forgetting his
own identity as spirit soul. This false ego associates with different modes of material nature, and thus the
senses become attached to the modes of material nature. Mind is the instrument for feeling different
material experiences, but intelligence is deliberative and can change everything for the better. The
intelligent person, therefore, can attain salvation from the illusion of material existence by proper use of
intelligence. An intelligent person can detect the awkward position of material existence and thus begin to
inquire as to what he is, why he is subjected to different kinds of miseries, and how to get rid of all
miseries, and thus, by good association, an advanced intelligent person can turn towards the better life of
self-realization. It is advised, therefore, that an intelligent person associate with the great sages and saints
who are on the path of salvation. By such association, one can receive instructions which are able to
slacken the conditioned soul's attachment for matter, and thus the intelligent man gradually gets rid of the
illusion of matter and false ego and is promoted to the real life of eternity, knowledge and bliss.
