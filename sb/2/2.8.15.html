TRANSLATION
The leader of the elephants, whose leg was attacked in a river by a crocodile of superior strength, was
much aggrieved. Taking a lotus flower in his trunk, he addressed the Lord, saying, "O original enjoyer,
Lord of the universe! O deliverer, as famous as a place of pilgrimage! All are purified simply by hearing
Your holy name, which is worthy to be chanted."
PURPORT
The history of delivering the leader of the elephants, whose leg was attacked in the river by the superior
strength of a crocodile, is described in the Eighth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Since the Lord is absolute
knowledge, there is no difference between His holy name and the personality of Godhead. The leader of
the elephants was much distressed when he was attacked by the crocodile. Although the elephant is
always stronger than the crocodile, the latter is stronger than the elephant when it is in the water. And
because the elephant was a great devotee of the Lord in his previous birth, he was able to chant the holy
name of the Lord by dint of his past good deeds. Every living entity is always distressed in this material
world because this place is such that at every step one has to meet with some kind of distress. But one
who is supported by his past good deeds engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, as
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.16). Those who are supported by impious acts cannot be engaged in
the devotional service of the Lord, even though they are distressed. This is also confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita (7.15). The personality of Godhead Hari appeared at once on the back of His eternal bearer,
Garuda, and delivered the elephant.
The elephant was conscious of his relation with the Supreme Lord. He addressed the Lord as adi-purusa,
or the original enjoyer. Both the Lord and the living beings are conscious and are therefore enjoyers, but
the Lord is the original enjoyer because He is the creator of everything. In a family, both the father and his
sons are undoubtedly enjoyers but the father is the original enjoyer, and the sons are subsequent enjoyers.
A pure devotee knows well that everything in the universe is the property of the Lord and that a living
entity can enjoy a thing as ordained by the Lord. A living being cannot even touch a thing which is not
allotted to him. This idea of the original enjoyer is explained very nicely in the Isopanisad. One who
knows this difference between the Lord and himself never accepts anything without first offering it to the
Lord.
The elephant addressed the Lord as akhila-loka-natha, or the Lord of the universe, who is therefore the
Lord of the elephant also. The elephant, being a pure devotee of the Lord, specifically deserved to be
saved from the attack of the crocodile, and because it is a promise of the Lord that His devotee will never
be vanquished, it was quite befitting that the elephant called upon the Lord to protect him, and the
merciful Lord also at once responded. The Lord is the protector of everyone, but He is the first protector
of one who acknowledges the superiority of the Lord instead of being so falsely proud as to deny the
superiority of the Lord or to claim to be equal to Him. He is ever superior. A pure devotee of the Lord
knows this difference between the Lord and himself. Therefore a pure devotee is given first preference
because of his full dependence, whereas the person who denies the existence of the Lord and declares
himself the Lord is called asura, and as such he is given protection by the strength of limited power
subject to the sanction of the Lord. Since the Lord is superior to everyone, His perfection is also superior.
No one can imagine it.
The elephant addressed the Lord as tirtha-sravah, or "as famous as a place of pilgrimage." People go to
places of pilgrimage in order to be delivered from the reactions of unknown sinful acts. But one can be
freed from all sinful reactions simply by remembering His holy name. The Lord is therefore as good as the
holy places of pilgrimage. One can be free from all sinful reactions after reaching a place of pilgrimage,
but one can have the same benefit at home or at any place simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord.
For a pure devotee, there is no need to go to the holy place of pilgrimage. He can be delivered from all
sinful acts simply by remembering the Lord in earnestness. A pure devotee of the Lord never commits any
sinful acts, but because the whole world is full of the sinful atmosphere, even a pure devotee may commit
a sin unconsciously, as a matter of course. One who commits sinful acts consciously cannot be worthy of
being a devotee of the Lord, but a pure devotee who unconsciously does something sinful is certainly
delivered by the Lord because a pure devotee remembers the Lord always.
The Lord's holy name is called sravana-mangala. This means that one receives everything auspicious
simply by hearing the holy name. In another place in Srimad-Bhagavatam, His holy name is described as
punya-sravana-kirtana. It is a pious act simply to chant and hear all about the Lord. The Lord descends on
this earth and acts like others in connection with the activities of the world just to create subject matters
for hearing about Him; otherwise the Lord has nothing to do in this world, nor has He any obligation to
do anything. He comes out of His own causeless mercy and acts as He desires, the Vedas and puranas are
full of descriptions of His different activities so that people in general may naturally be eager to hear and
read something about His activities. Generally, however, the modern fictions and novels of the world
occupy a greater part of people's valuable time. Such literatures cannot do good to anyone; on the
contrary, they agitate the young mind unnecessarily and increase the modes of passion and ignorance,
leading to increasing bondage to the material conditions. The same aptitude for hearing and reading is
better utilized in hearing and reading of the Lord's activities. This will give one all-around benefit.
It is concluded, therefore, that the holy name of the Lord and topics in relation with Him are always
worth hearing, and therefore He is called here in this verse nama-dheya, or one whose holy name is worth
chanting.
