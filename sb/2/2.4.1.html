sri-suka uvaca
evam etan nigaditam
prstavan yad bhavan mama
nrnam yan mriyamananam
manusyesu manisinam
SYNONYMS
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam--so; etat--all these; nigaditam--answered; prstavan--
as you inquired; yat--what; bhavan--your good self; mama--unto me; nrnam--of the human being; yat--
one; mriyamananam--on the threshold of death; manusyesu--amongst the human beings; manisinam--of
the intelligent men.
TRANSLATION
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Pariksit, as you have inquired from me as to the duty of the
intelligent man who is on the threshold of death, so I have answered you.
PURPORT
In human society all over the world there are millions and billions of men and women, and almost all of
them are less intelligent because they have very little knowledge of spirit soul. Almost all of them have a
wrong conception of life, for they identify themselves with the gross and subtle material bodies, which
they are not, in fact. They may be situated in different high and low positions in the estimation of human
society, but one should know definitely that unless one inquires about his own self beyond the body and
the mind, all his activities in human life are total failures. Therefore out of thousands and thousands of
men, one may inquire about his spirit self and thus consult the revealed scriptures like Vedanta-sutras,
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. But in spite of reading and hearing such scriptures, unless one is
in touch with a realized spiritual master, he cannot actually realize the real nature of self, etc. And out of
thousands and hundreds of thousands of men, someone may know what Lord Krsna is in fact. In the
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 20.122-123) it is said that Lord Krsna, out of His causeless mercy, prepared
the Vedic literatures in the incarnation of Vyasadeva for reading by the intelligent class of men in a human
society which is almost totally forgetful of the genuine relation with Krsna. Even such an intelligent class
of men may be forgetful in their relation with the Lord. The whole bhakti-yoga process is therefore a
revival of the lost relation. This revival is possible in the human form of life, which is obtained only out of
the evolutionary cycle of 8,400,000 species of life. The intelligent class of human being must take a
serious note of this opportunity. Not all human beings are intelligent, so the importance of human life is
not always understood. Therefore manisinam, meaning "thoughtful," is particularly used here. A
manisinam person, like Maharaja Pariksit, must therefore take to the lotus feet of Lord Krsna and fully
engage himself in devotional service, hearing, chanting, etc., of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord,
which are all hari-kathamrta. This action is especially recommended when one is preparing for death.

TRANSLATION
One who desires to be absorbed in the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence should worship the master of
the Vedas [Lord Brahma or Brhaspati, the learned priest], one who desires powerful sex should worship
the heavenly King, Indra, and one who desires good progeny should worship the great progenitors called
the Prajapatis. One who desires good fortune should worship Durgadevi, the superintendent of the
material world. One desiring to be very powerful should worship fire, and one who aspires only after
money should worship the Vasus. One should worship the Rudra incarnations of Lord Siva if he wants to
be a great hero. One who wants a large stock of grains should worship Aditi. One who desires to attain the
heavenly planets should worship the sons of Aditi. One who desires a worldly kingdom should worship
Visvadeva, and one who wants to be popular with the general mass of population should worship the
Sadhya demigod. One who desires a long span of life should worship the demigods known as the Asvinikumaras,
and a person desiring a strongly built body should worship the earth. One who desires stability
in his post should worship the horizon and the earth combined. One who desires to be beautiful should
worship the beautiful residents of the Gandharva planet, and one who desires a good wife should worship
the Apsaras and the Urvasi society girls of the heavenly kingdom. One who desires domination over
others should worship Lord Brahma, the head of the universe. One who desires tangible fame should
worship the Personality of Godhead, and one who desires a good bank balance should worship the
demigod Varuna. If one desires to be a greatly learned man he should worship Lord Siva, and if one
desires a good marital relation he should worship the chaste goddess Uma, the wife of Lord Siva.
PURPORT
There are different modes of worship for different persons desiring success in particular subjects. The
conditioned soul living within the purview of the material world cannot be an expert in every type of
materially enjoyable asset, but one can have considerable influence over a particular matter by worshiping
a particular demigod, as mentioned above. Ravana was made a very powerful man by worshiping Lord
Siva, and he used to offer severed heads to please Lord Siva. He became so powerful by the grace of Lord
Siva that all the demigods were afraid of him, until he at last challenged the Personality of Godhead Sri
Ramacandra and thus ruined himself. In other words, all such persons who aspire after gaining some or
all of the material objects of enjoyment, or the gross materialistic persons, are on the whole less
intelligent, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.20). It is said there that those who are bereft of all good
sense, or those whose intelligence is withdrawn by the deluding energy of maya, aspire to achieve all sorts
of material enjoyment in life by pleasing the various demigods, or by advancing in material civilization
under the heading of scientific progress. The real problem of life in the material world is to solve the
question of birth, death, old age and disease. No one wants to change his birthright, no one wants to meet
death, no one wants to be old or invalid, and no one wants diseases. But these problems are solved neither
by the grace of any demigod nor by the so-called advancement of material science. In the Bhagavad-gita,
as well as in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, such less intelligent persons have been described as devoid of all
good sense. Sukadeva Gosvami said that out of the 8,400,000 species of living entities, the human form of
life is rare and valuable, and out of those rare human beings those who are conscious of the material
problems are rarer still, and the still more rare persons are those who are conscious of the value of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which contains the messages of the Lord and His pure devotees. Death is inevitable
for everyone, intelligent or foolish. But Pariksit Maharaja has been addressed by the Gosvami as the
manisi, or the man of highly developed mind, because at the time of death he left all material enjoyment
and completely surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord by hearing His messages from the right person,
Sukadeva Gosvami. But aspirations for material enjoyment by endeavoring persons are condemned. Such
aspirations are something like the intoxication of the degraded human society. Intelligent persons should
try to avoid these aspirations and seek instead the permanent life by returning home, back to Godhead.
