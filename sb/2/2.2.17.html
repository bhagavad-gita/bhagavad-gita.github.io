forgotten.
TRANSLATION
After sitting in the above manner, make the mind remember the three transcendental letters [a-u-m],
and by regulating the breathing process, control the mind so as not to forget the transcendental seed.
PURPORT
Omkara, or the pranava, is the seed of transcendental realization, and it is composed of the three
transcendental letters a-u-m. By its chanting by the mind, in conjunction with the breathing process,
which is a transcendental but mechanical way of getting into trance, as devised by the experience of great
mystics, one is able to bring the mind, which is materially absorbed, under control. This is the way of
changing the habit of the mind. The mind is not to be killed. Mind or desire cannot be stopped, but to
develop a desire to function for spiritual realization, the quality of engagement by the mind has to be
changed. The mind is the pivot of the active sense organs, and as such if the quality of thinking, feeling
and willing is changed, naturally the quality of actions by the instrumental senses will also change.
Omkara is the seed of all transcendental sound and it is only the transcendental sound which can bring
about the desired change of the mind and the senses. Even a mentally deranged man can be cured by
treatment of transcendental sound. In the Bhagavad-gita, the pranava (omkara) has been accepted as the
direct, literal representation of the Supreme Absolute Truth. One who is not able to chant directly the
holy name of the Lord, as recommended above, can easily chant the pranava (omkara). This omkara is a
note of address, such as "O my Lord," just as om hari om means "O my Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead." As we have explained before, the Lord's holy name is identical with the Lord Himself. So also
is omkara. But persons who are unable to realize the transcendental personal form or name of the Lord on
account of their imperfect senses (in other words, the neophytes) are trained to the practice of selfrealization
by this mechanical process of regulating the breathing function and simultaneously repeating
the pranava (omkara) within the mind. As we have several times expressed, since the transcendental
name, form, attributes, pastimes, etc., of the Personality of Godhead are impossible to understand with
the present material senses, it is necessary that through the mind, the center of sensual activities, such
transcendental realization be set into motion. The devotees directly fix their minds on the Person of the
Absolute Truth. But one who is unable to accommodate such personal features of the Absolute is
disciplined in impersonality to train the mind to make further progress.
