<h2>Translation</h2>
I again offer my respectful obeisances unto the form of complete existence and transcendence, who is
the liberator of the pious devotees from all distresses and the destroyer of the further advances in atheistic
temperament of the nondevotee-demons. For the transcendentalists who are situated in the topmost
spiritual perfection, He grants their specific destinations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna is the complete form of all existence, both material and spiritual. Akhila means complete,
or that which is not khila, inferior. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, there are two kinds of nature (prakrti),
namely the material nature and the spiritual nature, or the external and internal potencies of the Lord.
The material nature is called apara, or inferior, and the spiritual nature is called superior or
transcendental. Therefore the form of the Lord is not of the inferior, material nature. He is complete
transcendence. And He is murti, or having transcendental form. The less intelligent men, who are
unaware of His transcendental form, describe Him as impersonal Brahman. But Brahman is simply the
rays of His transcendental body (yasya prabha). The devotees, who are aware of His transcendental form,
render Him service; therefore the Lord also reciprocates by His causeless mercy and thus delivers His
devotees from all distresses. The pious men who follow the rulings of the Vedas are also dear to Him, and
therefore the pious men of this world are also protected by Him. The impious and the nondevotees are
against the principles of the Vedas, and so such persons are always hampered from making advances in
their nefarious activities. Some of them, who are specially favored by the Lord, are killed by Him
personally, as in the cases of Ravana, Hiranyakasipu and Kamsa, and thus such demons get salvation and
are thereby checked from further progress in their demoniac activities. Just like a kind father, either in His
favor upon the devotees or His punishment of the demons He is ever kind to everyone because He is the
complete existence for all individual existence.
The paramahamsa stage of existence is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual values. According to
Srimati Kuntidevi, the Lord is factually understood by the paramahamsas only. As there is gradual
realization of the transcendence from impersonal Brahman to localized Paramatma to the Personality of
Godhead, Purusottama, Lord Krsna, similarly there is gradual promotion of one's situation in the spiritual
life of sannyasa. Kuticaka, bahudaka, parivrajakacarya and paramahamsa are gradual progressive stages in
the renounced order of life, sannyasa, and Queen Kuntidevi, the mother of the Pandavas, has spoken
about them in her prayers for Lord Krsna (Canto One, Chapter Eight). The paramahamsas are generally
found among both the impersonalists and the devotees, but according to Srimad-Bhagavatam (as clearly
stated by Kuntidevi), pure bhakti-yoga is understood by the paramahamsas, and Kuntidevi has especially
mentioned that the Lord descends (paritranaya sadhunam) especially to award bhakti-yoga to the
paramahamsas. So ultimately the paramahamsas, in the true sense of the term, are unalloyed devotees of
the Lord. Srila Jiva Gosvami has directly accepted that the highest destination is bhakti-yoga, by which
one accepts the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Those who accept the path of bhakti-yoga are
the factual paramahamsas.
Since the Lord is very kind to everyone, the impersonalists, who accept bhakti as the means of merging
in the existence of the Lord in His impersonal brahmajyoti, are also awarded their desired destination. He
has assured everyone in the Bhagavad-gita (4.11): ye yatha mam prapadyante. According to Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti, there are two classes of paramahamsas, namely the brahmanandis (impersonalists)
and the premanandis (devotees), and both are awarded their desired destinations, although the
premanandis are more fortunate than the brahmanandis. But both the brahmanandis and the premanandis
are transcendentalists, and they have nothing to do with the inferior, material nature full of the existential
miseries of life.
