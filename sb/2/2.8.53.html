TRANSLATION
The Lord's activities in association with His different energies should be described, appreciated and
heard in accordance with the teachings of the Supreme Lord. If this is done regularly with devotion and
respect, one is sure to get out of the illusory energy of the Lord.
PURPORT
The science of learning a subject matter seriously is different from the sentiments of fanatics. Fanatics or
fools may consider the Lord's activities in relation with the external energy to be useless for them, and
they may falsely claim to be higher participants in the internal energy of the Lord, but factually the Lord's
activities in relation with the external energy and the internal energy are equally good. On the other hand,
those who are not completely free from the clutches of the Lord's external energy should devoutly hear
regularly about the activities of the Lord in relation with the external energy. They should not foolishly
jump up to the activities of the internal energy, falsely attracted by the Lord's internal potential activities
like His rasa-lila. The cheap reciters of the Bhagavatam are very much enthusiastic about the Lord's
internal potential activities, and the pseudodevotees, absorbed in material sense enjoyment, falsely jump
to the stage of liberated souls and thus fall down deeply into the clutches of external energy.
Some of them think that to hear about the pastimes of the Lord means to hear about His activities with
the gopis or about His pastimes like lifting the Govardhana Hill, and they have nothing to do with the
Lord's plenary expansions as the purusavataras and Their pastimes of the creation, maintenance or
annihilation of the material worlds. But a pure devotee knows that there is no difference between the
pastimes of the Lord, either in rasa-lila or in creation, maintenance or destruction of the material world.
Rather, the descriptions of such activities of the Lord as the purusavataras are specifically meant for
persons who are in the clutches of the external energy. Topics like the rasa-lila are meant for the liberated
souls and not for the conditioned souls. The conditioned souls, therefore, must hear with appreciation
and devotion the Lord's pastimes in relationship with the external energy, and such acts are as good as the
hearing of rasa-lila in the liberated stage. A conditioned soul should not imitate the activities of liberated
souls. Lord Sri Caitanya never indulged in hearing the rasa-lila with ordinary men.
In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the science of God, the first nine cantos prepare the ground for hearing the
Tenth Canto. This will be further explained in the last chapter of this canto. In the Third Canto it will be
more explicit. A pure devotee of the Lord, therefore, must begin reading or hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam
from the very beginning, and not from the Tenth Canto. We have several times been requested by some
so-called devotees to take up the Tenth Canto immediately, but we have refrained from such an action
because we wish to present Srimad-Bhagavatam as the science of Godhead and not as a sensuous
understanding for the conditioned souls. This is forbidden by such authorities as Sri Brahmaji. By reading
and hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam as a scientific presentation, the conditioned souls will gradually be
promoted to the higher status of transcendental knowledge after being freed from the illusory energy
based on sense enjoyment.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Seventh Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Scheduled Incarnations with Specific Functions."
