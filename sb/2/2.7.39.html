<h2>Translation</h2>
At the beginning of creation there are penance, myself [Brahma], and the Prajapatis, the great sages who
generate; then, during the maintenance of the creation, there are Lord Visnu, the demigods with
controlling powers, and the kings of different planets. But at the end there is irreligion, and then Lord Siva
and the atheists full of anger, etc. All of them are different representative manifestations of the energy of
the supreme power, the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world is created by the energy of the Lord, which is manifested in the beginning of the
creation by the penance of Brahmaji, the first living being in the creation, and then there are the nine
Prajapatis, known as great sages. In the stage when the creation is maintained, there are devotional service
to Lord Visnu, or factual religion, the different demigods, and the kings of different planets who maintain
the world. At last, when the creation is preparing to wind up, there is first the principle of irreligion, then
Lord Siva along with the atheists, full of anger. But all of them are but different manifestations of the
Supreme Lord. Therefore Brahma, Visnu and Mahadeva (Siva) are different incarnations of the different
modes of material nature. Visnu is the Lord of the mode of goodness. Brahma is the lord of the mode of
passion, and Siva is the lord of the mode of ignorance. Ultimately, the material creation is but a temporary
manifestation meant to give the chance of liberation to the conditioned souls, who are entrapped in the
material world, and one who develops the mode of goodness under the protection of Lord Visnu has the
greatest chance of being liberated by following the Vaisnava principles and thus being promoted to the
kingdom of God, no more to return to this miserable material world.
