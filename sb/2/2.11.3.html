bhuta-matrendriya-dhiyam
janma sarga udahrtah
brahmano guna-vaisamyad
visargah paurusah smrtah
SYNONYMS
bhuta--the five gross elements (the sky, etc.); matra--objects perceived by the senses; indriya--the
senses; dhiyam--of the mind; janma--creation; sargah--manifestation; udahrtah--is called the creation;
brahmanah--of Brahma, the first purusa; guna-vaisamyat--by interaction of the three modes of nature;
visargah--re-creation; paurusah--resultant activities; smrtah--it is so known.
TRANSLATION
The elementary creation of sixteen items of matter--namely the five elements [fire, water, land, air and
sky], sound, form, taste, smell, touch, and the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, skin and mind--is known as sarga,
whereas subsequent resultant interaction of the modes of material nature is called visarga.
PURPORT
In order to explain the ten divisional symptoms of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, there are seven continuous
verses. The first of these under reference pertains to the sixteen elementary manifestations of earth, water,
etc., with material ego composed of material intelligence and mind. The subsequent creation is a result of
the reactions of the above-mentioned sixteen energies of the first purusa, the Maha-Visnu incarnation of
Govinda, as later explained by Brahma in his treatise Brahma-samhita (5.47) as follows:
yah karanarnava-jale bhajati sma yoganidram
ananta-jagad-anda-sa-roma-kupah
adhara-saktim avalambya param sva-murtim
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
The first purusa incarnation of Govinda, Lord Krsna, known as the Maha-Visnu, goes into a yoga-nidra
mystic sleep, and the innumerable universes are situated in potency in each and every hair hole of His
transcendental body.
As mentioned in the previous verse, srutena (or with reference to the Vedic conclusions), the creation is
made possible from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly by manifestation of His particular
energies. Without such a Vedic reference, the creation appears to be a product of material nature. This
conclusion comes from a poor fund of knowledge. From Vedic reference it is concluded that the origin of
all energies (namely internal, external and marginal) is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And as
explained hereinbefore, the illusory conclusion is that creation is made by the inert material nature. The
Vedic conclusion is transcendental light, whereas the non-Vedic conclusion is material darkness. The
internal potency of the Supreme Lord is identical with the Supreme Lord, and the external potency is
enlivened in contact with the internal potency. The parts and parcels of the internal potency which react
in contact with the external potency are called the marginal potency, or the living entities.
Thus the original creation is directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or Parambrahman, and
the secondary creation, as a reactionary result of the original ingredients, is made by Brahma. Thus the
activities of the whole universe are started.
