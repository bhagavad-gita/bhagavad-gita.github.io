tad aham te 'bhidhasyami
maha-paurusiko bhavan
yasya sraddadhatam asu
syan mukunde matih sati

of Lord Krsna; bhavan--your good self; yasya--of which; sraddadhatam--of one who gives full respect and

TRANSLATION
That very Srimad-Bhagavatam I shall recite before you because you are the most sincere devotee of Lord
Krsna. One who gives full attention and respect to hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam achieves unflinching faith
in the Supreme Lord, the giver of salvation.
PURPORT
Srimad-Bhagavatam is recognized Vedic wisdom, and the system of receiving Vedic knowledge is called
avaroha-pantha, or the process of receiving transcendental knowledge through bona fide disciplic
succession. For advancement of material knowledge there is a need for personal ability and researching
aptitude, but in the case of spiritual knowledge, all progress depends more or less on the mercy of the
spiritual master. The spiritual master must be satisfied with the disciple; only then is knowledge
automatically manifest before the student of spiritual science. The process should not, however, be
misunderstood to be something like magical feats whereby the spiritual master acts like a magician and
injects spiritual knowledge into his disciple, as if surcharging him with an electrical current. The bona
fide spiritual master reasonably explains everything to the disciple on the authorities of Vedic wisdom.
The disciple can receive such teachings not exactly intellectually, but by submissive inquiries and a
service attitude. The idea is that both the spiritual master and the disciple must be bona fide. In this case,
the spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, is ready to recite exactly what he has learned from his great
father Srila Vyasadeva, and the disciple, Maharaja Pariksit, is a great devotee of Lord Krsna. A devotee of
Lord Krsna is he who believes sincerely that by becoming a devotee of the Lord one becomes fully
equipped with everything spiritual. This teaching is imparted by the Lord Himself in the pages of the
Bhagavad-gita, in which it is clearly described that the Lord (Sri Krsna) is everything, and that to
surrender unto Him solely and wholly makes one the most perfectly pious man. This unflinching faith in
Lord Krsna prepares one to become a student of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and one who hears Srimad-
Bhagavatam from a devotee like Sukadeva Gosvami is sure to attain salvation at the end, as Maharaja
Pariksit did. The professional reciter of Srimad-Bhagavatam and the pseudodevotees whose faith is based
on one week's hearing are different from Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja Pariksit. Srila Vyasadeva
explained Srimad-Bhagavatam unto Sukadeva Gosvami from the very beginning of the janmady asya
verse, and so Sukadeva Gosvami also explained it to the Ding. Lord Krsna is described as the Mahapurusa
in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (Canto Eleven) in His devotional feature as Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu is Lord Krsna Himself in His devotional attitude, descended on earth to bestow
special favors upon the fallen souls of this age of Kali. There are two verses particularly suitable to offer as
prayers to this Mahapurusa feature of Lord Krsna.
dhyeyam sada paribhava-ghnam abhista-doham
tirthaspadam siva-virinci-nutam saranyam
bhrtyarti-ham pranata-pala bhavabdhi-potam
vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam
tyaktva su-dustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmim
dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam
maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad
vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam
(Bhag. 11.5.33-34)
In other words, purusa means the enjoyer, and mahapurusa means the supreme enjoyer, or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna. One who deserves to approach the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna is called the
maha-paurusika. Anyone who hears Srimad-Bhagavatam attentively from its bona fide reciter is sure to
become a sincere devotee of the Lord, who is able to award liberation. There was none so attentive as
Maharaja Pariksit in the matter of hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam, and there was none so qualified as
Sukadeva Gosvami to recite the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Therefore, anyone who follows in the
footsteps of either the ideal reciter or the ideal hearer, Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja Pariksit
respectively, will undoubtedly attain salvation like them. Maharaja Pariksit attained salvation by hearing
only, and Sukadeva Gosvami attained salvation only by reciting. Recitation and hearing are two processes
out of nine devotional activities, and by strenuously following the principles, either in all or by parts, one
can attain the absolute plane. So the complete text of Srimad-Bhagavatam, beginning with the janmady
asya verse up to the last one in the Twelfth Canto, was spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami for the attainment of
salvation by Maharaja Pariksit. In the Padma Purana, it is mentioned that Gautama Muni advised
Maharaja Ambarisa to hear regularly Srimad-Bhagavatam as it was recited by Sukadeva Gosvami, and
herein it is confirmed that Maharaja Ambarisa heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from the very beginning to the
end, as it was spoken by Sukadeva Gosvami. One who is actually interested in the Bhagavatam, therefore,
must not play with it by reading or hearing a portion from here and a portion from there; one must follow
in the footsteps of great kings like Maharaja Ambarisa or Maharaja Pariksit and hear it from a bona fide
representative of Sukadeva Gosvami.
