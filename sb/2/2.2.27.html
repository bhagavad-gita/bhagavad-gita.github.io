<h2>Translation</h2>
In that planet of Satyaloka, there is neither bereavement, nor old age nor death. There is no pain of any
kind, and therefore there are no anxieties, save that sometimes, due to consciousness, there is a feeling of
compassion for those unaware of the process of devotional service, who are subjected to unsurpassable
miseries in the material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Foolish men of materialistic temperament do not take advantage of successive authorized knowledge.
The Vedic knowledge is authorized and is acquired not by experiment but by authentic statements of the
Vedic literatures explained by bona fide authorities. Simply by becoming an academic scholar one cannot
understand the Vedic statements; one has to approach the real authority who has received the Vedic
knowledge by disciplic succession, as clearly explained in the Bhagavad-gita (4.2). Lord Krsna affirmed
that the system of knowledge as explained in the Bhagavad-gita was explained to the sun-god, and the
knowledge descended by disciplic succession from the sun-god to his son Manu, and from Manu to King
Iksvaku (the forefather of Lord Ramacandra), and thus the system of knowledge was explained down the
line of great sages, one after another. But in due course of time the authorized succession was broken, and
therefore, just to reestablish the true spirit of the knowledge, the Lord again explained the same
knowledge to Arjuna, who was a bona fide candidate for understanding due to his being a pure devotee of
the Lord. Bhagavad-gita, as it was understood by Arjuna, is also explained (Bg. 10.12-13), but there are
many foolish men who do not follow in the footsteps of Arjuna in understanding the spirit of Bhagavadgita.
They create instead their own interpretations, which are as foolish as they themselves, and thereby
only help to put a stumbling block on the path of real understanding, misdirecting the innocent followers
who are less intelligent, or the sudras. It is said that one should become a brahmana before one can
understand the Vedic statements, and this stricture is as important as the stricture that no one shall
become a lawyer who has not qualified himself as a graduate. Such a stricture is not an impediment in the
path of progress for anyone and everyone, but it is necessary for an unqualified understanding of a
particular science. Vedic knowledge is misinterpreted by those who are not qualified brahmanas. A
qualified brahmana is one who has undergone strict training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual
master.
The Vedic wisdom guides us to understanding our relation with the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna and to
acting accordingly in order to achieve the desired result of returning home, back to Godhead. But
materialistic men do not understand this. They want to make a plan to become happy in a place where
there is no happiness. For false happiness they try to reach other planets, either by Vedic rituals or by
spacecraft, but they should know for certain that any amount of materialistic adjustment for becoming
happy in a place which is meant for distress cannot benefit the misguided man because, after all, the
whole universe with all its paraphernalia will come to an end after a certain period. Then all plans of
materialistic happiness will automatically come to an end. The intelligent person therefore makes a plan
to return home, back to Godhead. Such an intelligent person surpasses all the pangs of material existence,
like birth, death, disease and old age. He is actually happy because he has no anxieties of material
existence, but as a compassionate sympathizer he feels unhappiness for the suffering materialistic men,
and thus he occasionally comes before the materialistic men to teach them the necessity of going back to
Godhead. All the bona fide acaryas preach this truth of returning home, back to Godhead, and warn men
not to make a false plan for happiness in a place where happiness is only a myth.
