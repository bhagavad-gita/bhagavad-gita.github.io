<h2>Text</h2>
etad evatma-bhu rajan

veda-garbho 'bhyadhat saksad
yad aha harir atmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--on this matter; eva--exactly; atma-bhuh--the firstborn (Brahmaji); rajan--my dear King; naradaya--
unto Narada Muni; viprcchate--having inquired about it from; veda-garbhah--one who is impregnated
with Vedic knowledge from birth; abhyadhat--apprised; saksat--directly; yat aha--what he spoke; harih--
the Lord; atmanah--unto His own (Brahma).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear King, Brahma, the firstborn, on being questioned by Narada, exactly apprised him on this
subject, as it was directly spoken by the Lord to His own son, who was impregnated with Vedic
knowledge from his very birth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As soon as Brahma was born of the abdominal lotus petals of Visnu, he was impregnated with Vedic
knowledge, and therefore he is known as veda-garbha, or a Vedantist from the embryo. Without Vedic
knowledge, or perfect, infallible knowledge, no one can create anything. All scientific knowledge and
perfect knowledge are Vedic. One can get all types of information from the Vedas, and as such, Brahma
was impregnated with all-perfect knowledge so that it was possible for him to create. Thus Brahma knew
the perfect description of creation, as it was exactly apprised to him by the Supreme Lord Hari. Brahma,
on being questioned by Narada, told Narada exactly what he had heard directly from the Lord. Narada
again told exactly the same thing to Vyasa, and Vyasa also told Sukadeva exactly what he heard from
Narada. And Sukadeva was going to repeat the same statements as he had heard them from Vyasa. That is
the way of Vedic understanding. The language of the Vedas can be revealed only by the above-mentioned
disciplic succession, and not otherwise.
There is no use in theories. Knowledge must be factual. There are many things that are complicated, and
one cannot understand them unless they are explained by one who knows. The Vedic knowledge is also
very difficult to know and must be learned by the above-mentioned system; otherwise it is not at all
understood.
Sukadeva Gosvami, therefore, prayed for the mercy of the Lord so that he might be able to repeat the
very same message that was spoken directly by the Lord to Brahma, or what was directly spoken by
Brahma to Narada. Therefore the statements of creation explained by Sukadeva Gosvami are not at all, as
the mundaners suggest, theoretical, but are perfectly correct. One who hears these messages and tries to
assimilate them gets perfect information of the material creation.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Fourth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The process of Creation."
