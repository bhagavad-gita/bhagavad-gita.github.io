vayamsi tad-vyakaranam vicitram
manur manisa manujo nivasah
gandharva-vidyadhara-caranapsarah
svara-smrtir asuranika-viryah

vayamsi--varieties of birds; tat-vyakaranam--vocables; vicitram--artistic; manuh--the father of mankind;
manisa--thoughts; manujah--mankind (the sons of Manu); nivasah--residence; gandharva--the human
beings named Gandharvas; vidyadhara--the Vidyadharas; carana--the Caranas; apsarah--the angels; svara--

TRANSLATION
Varieties of birds are indications of His masterful artistic sense. Manu, the father of mankind, is the
emblem of His standard intelligence, and humanity is His residence. The celestial species of human
beings, like the Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Caranas and angels, all represent His musical rhythm, and the
demoniac soldiers are representations of His wonderful prowess.
PURPORT
The aesthetic sense of the Lord is manifested in the artistic, colorful creation of varieties of birds like the
peacock, parrot and cuckoo. The celestial species of human beings, like the Gandharvas and Vidyadharas,
can sing wonderfully and can entice even the minds of the heavenly demigods. Their musical rhythm
represents the musical sense of the Lord. How then can He be impersonal? His musical taste, artistic sense
and standard intelligence, which is never fallible, are different signs of His supreme personality. The
Manu-samhita is the standard lawbook for humanity, and every human being is advised to follow this
great book of social knowledge. Human society is the residential quarters for the Lord. This means that
the human being is meant for God realization and association with God. This life is a chance for the
conditioned soul to regain his eternal God consciousness and thus fulfill the mission of life. Maharaja
Prahlada is the right type of representative of the Lord in the family of asuras. None of the living beings is
away from the Lord's gigantic body. Each and every one has a particular duty in relation to the supreme
body. Disruption in the matter of discharging the specific duty assigned to each and every living being is
the cause of disharmony between one living being and another, but when the relation is reestablished in
relation with the Supreme Lord, there is complete unity between all living beings, even up to the limit of
the wild animals and human society. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu displayed this living unity in the jungle
of Madhya Pradesh, where even the tigers, elephants and many other ferocious animals perfectly
cooperated in glorifying the Supreme Lord. That is the way to peace and amity all over the world.
