<h2>Translation</h2>
Transcendental knowledge in relation with the Supreme Lord Hari is knowledge resulting in the
complete suspension of the waves and whirlpools of the material modes. Such knowledge is self-satisfying
due to its being free from material attachment, and being transcendental it is approved by authorities.
Who could fail to be attracted?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Bhagavad-gita (10.9) the characteristics of pure devotees are wonderful. The complete
functional activities of a pure devotee are always engaged in the service of the Lord, and thus the pure
devotees exchange feelings of ecstasy between themselves and relish transcendental bliss. This
transcendental bliss is experienced even in the stage of devotional practice (sadhana-avastha), if properly
undertaken under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. And in the mature stage the developed
transcendental feeling culminates in realization of the particular relationship with the Lord by which a
living entity is originally constituted (up to the relationship of conjugal love with the Lord, which is
estimated to be the highest transcendental bliss). Thus bhakti-yoga, being the only means of God
realization, is called kaivalya. Srila Jiva Gosvami quotes the Vedic version (eko narayano devah,
paravaranam parama aste kaivalya-samjnitah) in this connection and establishes that Narayana, the
Personality of Godhead, is known as kaivalya, and the means which enables one to approach the Lord is
called the kaivalya-pantha, or the only means of attainment of Godhead. This kaivalya-pantha begins from
sravana, or hearing those topics that relate to the Personality of Godhead, and the natural consequence of
hearing such hari-katha is attainment of transcendental knowledge, which causes detachment from all
mundane topics, for which a devotee has no taste at all. For a devotee, all mundane activities, social and
political, become unattractive, and in the mature state such a devotee becomes uninterested even in his
own body, and what to speak of bodily relatives. In such a state of affairs one is not agitated by the waves
of the material modes. There are different modes of material nature, and all mundane functions in which a
common man is very much interested or in which he takes part become unattractive for the devotee. This
state of affairs is described herein as pratinivrtta-gunormi, and it is possible by atma-prasada, or complete
self-satisfaction without any material connection. The first-class devotee of the Lord attains this stage by
devotional service, but despite his loftiness, for the Lord's satisfaction he may play the voluntary part of a
preacher of the Lord's glory and dovetail all into devotional service, even mundane interest, just to give
the neophytes a chance to transform mundane interest into transcendental bliss. Srila Rupa Gosvami has
described this action of a pure devotee as nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate. Even
mundane activities dovetailed with service to the Lord are also calculated to be transcendental or
approved kaivalya affairs.
