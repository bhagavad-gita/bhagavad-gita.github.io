<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--from there; bhruvoh--of the eyebrows; antaram--in between; unnayeta--should be brought in;
niruddha--by blocking; sapta--seven; ayatanah--outlets of the life air; anapeksah--independent of all
material enjoyment; sthitva--by keeping; muhurta--of a moment; ardham--half; akuntha--back home, back
to Godhead; drstih--one whose aim is targeted like that; nirbhidya--punching; murdhan--the cerebral
hole; visrjet--should give up his body; param--the Supreme; gatah--having gone to.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter the bhakti-yogi should push the life air up between the eyebrows, and then, blocking the
seven outlets of the life air, he should maintain his aim for going back home, back to Godhead. If he is
completely free from all desires for material enjoyment, he should then reach the cerebral hole and give
up his material connections, having gone to the Supreme.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The process of giving up all material connections and returning home, back to Godhead, the Supreme,
is recommended herein. The condition is that one should be completely freed from desire for material
enjoyment. There are different grades of material enjoyments in respect to duration of life and sensual
gratification. The highest plane of sensual enjoyment for the longest period of life is mentioned in the
Bhagavad-gita (9.20). All are but material enjoyments, and one should be thoroughly convinced that he
has no need of such a long duration of life, even in the Brahmaloka planet. He must return home, back to
Godhead, and must not be attracted by any amount of material facilities. In the Bhagavad-gita (2.59) it is
said that this sort of material detachment is possible to attain when one is acquainted with the supreme
association of life. Param drstva nivartate. One cannot be freed from material attraction unless he has
complete understanding of the nature of spiritual life. The propaganda by a certain class of impersonalists
that spiritual life is void of all varieties is dangerous propaganda to mislead the living beings into
becoming more and more attracted by material enjoyments. As such, persons with a poor fund of
knowledge cannot have any conception of the param, the Supreme; they try to stick to the varieties of
material enjoyments, although they may flatter themselves as being Brahman-realized souls. Such less
intelligent persons cannot have any conception of the param, as mentioned in this verse, and therefore
they cannot reach the Supreme. The devotees have full knowledge of the spiritual world, the Personality
of Godhead and His transcendental association in unlimited spiritual planets called Vaikunthalokas.
Herein akuntha-drstih is mentioned. Akuntha and vaikuntha convey the same import, and only one who
has his aim fixed upon that spiritual world and personal association with the Godhead can give up his
material connections even while living in the material world. This param and the param dhama
mentioned in several places in the Bhagavad-gita are one and the same thing. One who goes to the param
dhama does not return to the material world. This freedom is not possible even by reaching the topmost
loka of the material world.
The life air passes through seven openings, namely two eyes, two nostrils, two ears and one mouth.
Generally it passes through the mouth at the time of an ordinary man's death. But the yogi, as above
mentioned, who controls the life air in his own way, generally releases the life air by puncturing the
cerebral hole in the head. The yogi therefore blocks up all the above-mentioned seven openings, so that
the life air will naturally burst forth through the cerebral hole. This is the sure sign of a great devotee's
leaving the material connection.
