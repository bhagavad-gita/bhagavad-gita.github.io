<h2>Purport</h2>
Vaikarika is the neutral stage of creation, and tejas is the initiative of creation, while tamas is the full
display of material creation under the spell of the darkness of ignorance. Manufacture of the "necessities
of life" in factories and workshops, excessively prominent in the age of Kali, or in the age of the machine,
is the summit stage of the quality of darkness. Such manufacturing enterprises by human society are in
the mode of darkness because factually there is no necessity for the commodities manufactured. Human
society primarily requires food for subsistence, shelter for sleeping, defense for protection, and
commodities for satisfaction of the senses. The senses are the practical signs of life, as will be explained in
the next verse. Human civilization is meant for purifying the senses, and objects of sense satisfaction
should be supplied as much as absolutely required, but not for aggravating artificial sensory needs. Food,
shelter, defense and sense gratification are all needs in material existence. Otherwise, in his pure,
uncontaminated state of original life, the living entity has no such needs. The needs are therefore artificial,
and in the pure state of life there are no such needs. As such, increasing the artificial needs, as is the
standard of material civilization, or advancing the economic development of human society, is a sort of
engagement in darkness, without knowledge. By such engagement, human energy is spoiled, because
human energy is primarily meant for purifying the senses in order to engage them in satisfying the senses
of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord, being the supreme possessor of spiritual senses, is the master of
the senses, Hrsikesa. Hrsika means the senses, and isa means the master. The Lord is not the servant of
the senses, or, in other words, He is not directed by the dictation of the senses, but the conditioned souls
or the individual living entities are servants of the senses. They are conducted by the direction or dictation
of the senses, and therefore material civilization is a kind of engagement in sense gratification only. The
standard of human civilization should be to cure the disease of sense gratification, and one can do this
simply by becoming an agent for satisfying the spiritual senses of the Lord. The senses are never to be
stopped in their engagements, but one should purify them by engaging them in the pure service of sense
gratification of the master of the senses. This is the instruction of the whole Bhagavad-gita. Arjuna wanted
first of all to satisfy his own senses by his decision not to fight with his kinsmen and friends, but Lord Sri
Krsna taught him the Bhagavad-gita just to purify Arjuna's decision for sense gratification. Therefore
Arjuna agreed to satisfy the senses of the Lord, and thus he fought the Battle of Kuruksetra, as the Lord
desired.
The Vedas instruct us to get out of the existence of darkness and go forward on the path of light (tamasi
ma jyotir gama). The path of light is therefore to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Misguided men, or less
intelligent men, follow the path of self-realization without any attempt to satisfy the transcendental senses
of the Lord by following the path shown by Arjuna and other devotees of the Lord. On the contrary, they
artificially try to stop the activities of the senses (yoga system), or they deny the transcendental senses of
the Lord (jnana system). The devotees, however, are above the yogis and the jnanis because pure devotees
do not deny the senses of the Lord; they want to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Only because of the
darkness of ignorance do the yogis and jnanis deny the senses of the Lord and thus artificially try to
control the activities of the diseased senses. In the diseased condition of the senses there is too much
engagement of the senses in increasing material needs. When one comes to see the disadvantage of
aggravating the sense activities, one is called a jnani, and when one tries to stop the activities of the senses
by the practice of yogic principles, he is called a yogi, but when one is fully aware of the transcendental
senses of the Lord and tries to satisfy His senses, one is called a devotee of the Lord. The devotees of the
Lord do not try to deny the senses of the Lord, nor do they artificially stop the actions of the senses. But
they do voluntarily engage the purified senses in the service of the master of the senses, as was done by
Arjuna, thereby easily attaining the perfection of satisfying the Lord, the ultimate goal of all perfection.
