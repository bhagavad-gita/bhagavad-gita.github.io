mayaya vyasrjat tridha
SYNONYMS
ekah--He, one alone; nanatvam--varieties; anvicchan--so desiring; yoga-talpat--from the bedstead of
mystic slumber; samutthitah--thus generated; viryam--the semina; hiranmayam--golden hue; devah--the
demigod; mayaya--by the external energy; vyasrjat--perfectly created; tridha--in three features.
TRANSLATION
The Lord, while lying on His bed of mystic slumber, generated the seminal symbol, golden in hue,
through external energy out of His desire to manifest varieties of living entities from Himself alone.
PURPORT
In the Bhagavad-gita (9.7-8) the creation and annihilation of the material world are stated as follows:
sarva-bhutani kaunteya
prakrtim yanti mamikam
kalpa-ksaye punas tani
kalpadau visrjamy aham
prakrtim svam avastabhya
visrjami punah punah
bhuta-gramam imam krtsnam
avasam prakrter vasat
"At the end of each millennium the creative forces, namely the material nature and the living entities
who struggle in the material nature, all merge together into the transcendental body of the Lord, and
again when the Lord desires to manifest them, all of them are again displayed by the Lord.
"Therefore the material nature is working under the control of the Lord. All of them, under the agency
of material nature and under the control of the Lord, are thus repeatedly created and annihilated by the
will of the Lord."
As such, before the creation or manifestation of the material cosmic world, the Lord exists as total
energy (maha-samasti), and thus desiring Himself to be diffused to many, He expands Himself further into
multitotal energy (samasti). From the multitotal energy He further expands Himself into individuals in
three dimensions, namely adhyatmic, adhidaivic and adhibhautic, as explained before (vyasti). As such,
the whole creation and the creative energies are nondifferent and different simultaneously. Because
everything is an emanation from Him (the Maha-Visnu or Maha-samasti), nothing of the cosmic energies
is different from Him; but all such expanded energies have specific functions and display as designed by
the Lord, and therefore they are simultaneously different from the Lord. The living entities are also similar
energy (marginal potency) of the Lord, and thus they are simultaneously one with and different from
Him.
At the stage of nonmanifestation, the living energies remain potent in the Lord, and when they are let
loose in the cosmic manifestation they are exhibited differently in terms of different desires under the
modes of nature. Such differential manifestations of the living energies are conditional states of the living
entities. The liberated living entities, however, in the sanatana (eternal) manifestation, are unconditionally
surrendered souls, and therefore they are not subject to the conditions of creation and annihilation. So
this creation takes place by the glance of the Lord from His bedstead of mystic slumber. And thus all the
universes and the lord of the universe, Brahma, are again and again manifested and annihilated.
