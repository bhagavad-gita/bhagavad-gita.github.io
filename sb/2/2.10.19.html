<h2>Text</h2>
vivaksor mukhato bhumno
vahnir vag vyahrtam tayoh
jale caitasya suciram
nirodhah samajayata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vivaksoh--when there was a need to speak; mukhatah--from the mouth; bhumnah--of the Supreme;
vahnih--fire or the controlling deity of fire; vak--vibration; vyahrtam--speeches; tayoh--by both; jale--in
the water; ca--however; etasya--of all these; suciram--a very, very long time; nirodhah--suspension;
samajayata--did continue.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Supreme desired to speak, speeches were vibrated from the mouth. Then the controlling deity
Fire was generated from the mouth. But when He was lying in the water, all these functions remained
suspended.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The peculiarity of the gradual development of the different senses is simultaneously supported by their
controlling deities. It is to be understood, therefore, that the activities of the sense organs are controlled
by the will of the Supreme. The senses are, so to speak, offering a license for the conditioned souls, who
are to use them properly under the control of the controlling deity deputed by the Supreme Lord. One
who violates such controlling regulations has to be punished by degradation to a lower status of life.
Consider, for example, the tongue and its controlling deity, Varuna. The tongue is meant for eating, and
men, animals and birds each have their different tastes because of different licenses. The taste of human
beings and that of the swine are not on the same level. The controlling deity, however, awards or certifies
a particular type of body when the particular living entity develops a taste in terms of different modes of
nature. If the human being develops taste without discrimination, as does the swine, then the controlling
deity is certainly certified for the next term to award him the body of a swine. The swine accepts any kind
of foodstuff, including stools, and a human being who has developed such indiscriminate taste must be
prepared for a degraded life in the next life. Such a life is also God's grace because the conditioned soul
desired a body like that for perfectly tasting a particular type of foodstuff. If a man gets the body of a
swine it must be considered the grace of the Lord because the Lord awards the facility. After death the
next body is offered by superior control, not blindly. A human being, therefore, must be on his guard as
to what sort of body he is going to have in the next life. An irresponsible life of indiscrimination is risky,
and that is the declaration of all scriptures.
