ittham-bhavena kathito
bhagavan bhagavattamah
nettham-bhavena hi param
drastum arhanti surayah

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ittham--in these features; bhavena--the matter of creation and destruction; kathitah--described;
bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; bhagavat-tamah--by the great transcendentalists; na--not; ittham--
in this; bhavena--features; hi--only; param--most glorious; drastum--to see; arhanti--deserve; surayah--
great devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great transcendentalists thus describe the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the
pure devotees deserve to see more glorious things in transcendence, beyond these features.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is not only the creator and destroyer of the material manifestations of His different energies.
He is more than a simple creator and destroyer, for there is His feature of ananda, or His pleasure feature.
This pleasure feature of the Lord is understood by the pure devotees only, and not by others. The
impersonalist is satisfied simply by understanding the all-pervasive influence of the Lord. This is called
Brahman realization. Greater than the impersonalist is the mystic who sees the Lord situated in his heart
as Paramatma, the partial representation of the Lord. But there are pure devotees who take part in the
direct pleasure (ananda) potency of the Lord by factual reciprocation of loving service. The Lord in His
abode called the Vaikuntha planets, which are eternal manifestations, always remains with His associates
and enjoys transcendental loving services by His pure devotees in different transcendental humors. The
pure devotees of the Lord thus undergo a practice of that devotional service to the Lord during the
manifestation of the creation and take full advantage of the manifestation by qualifying themselves to
enter into the kingdom of God. The Bhagavad-gita (18.55) confirms this:
bhaktya mam abhijanati
yavan yas casmi tattvatah
tato mam tattvato jnatva
visate tad-anantaram
By development of pure devotional service one can factually know the Lord as He is and thus be trained
in the bona fide service of the Lord and be allowed to enter into the direct association of the Lord in so
many capacities. The highest glorious association with the Lord is made possible in the planet of Goloka
Vrndavana, where Lord Krsna enjoys Himself with the gopis and His favorite animals, the surabhi cows. A
description of this transcendental land of Krsna is given in the Brahma-samhita, which is considered by
Lord Sri Caitanya to be the most authentic literature in this connection.
