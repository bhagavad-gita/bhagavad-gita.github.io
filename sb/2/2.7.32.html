<h2>Translation</h2>
When the cowherd men of Vrndavana, under instruction of Krsna, stopped offering sacrifice to the
heavenly King, Indra, the whole tract of land known as Vraja was threatened with being washed away by
constant heavy rains for seven days. Lord Krsna, out of His causeless mercy upon the inhabitants of Vraja,
held up the hill known as Govardhana with one hand only, although He was only seven years old. He did
this to protect the animals from the onslaught of water.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Children play with an umbrella generally known as a frog's umbrella, and Lord Krsna, when He was
only seven years old, could snatch the great hill known as the Govardhana Parvata at Vrndavana and hold
it for seven days continuously with one hand, just to protect the animals and the inhabitants of Vrndavana
from the wrath of Indra, the heavenly King, who had been denied sacrificial offerings by the inhabitants of
Vrajabhumi.
Factually there is no need of offering sacrifices to the demigods for their services if one is engaged in the
service of the Supreme Lord. Sacrifices recommended in the Vedic literature for satisfaction of the
demigods are a sort of inducement to the sacrificers to realize the existence of higher authorities. The
demigods are engaged by the Lord as controlling deities of material affairs, and according to the
Bhagavad-gita, when a demigod is worshiped the process is accepted as the indirect method for
worshiping the Supreme Lord. But when the Supreme Lord is worshiped directly there is no need of
worshiping the demigods or offering them sacrifices as recommended in particular circumstances. Lord
Krsna therefore advised the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi not to offer any sacrifices to the heavenly King
Indra. But Indra, not knowing Lord Krsna in Vrajabhumi, was angry at the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi and
tried to avenge the offense. But, competent as the Lord was, He saved the inhabitants and animals of
Vrajabhumi by His personal energy and proved definitely that anyone directly engaged as a devotee of the
Supreme Lord need not satisfy any other demigods, however great, even to the level of Brahma, or Siva.
Thus this incident definitely proved without a doubt that Lord Krsna is the Personality of Godhead and
that He was so in all circumstances, as a child on the lap of His mother, as a boy 7 years old, and as an old
man of 125 years of age. In either case He was never on the level of the ordinary man, and even in His
advanced age He appeared a young boy 16 years old. These are the particular features of the
transcendental body of the Lord.
