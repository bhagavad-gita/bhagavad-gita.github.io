<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit, as a result of his wholehearted attraction for Lord Krsna, was able to give up all deeprooted
affection for his personal body, his wife, his children, his palace, his animals like horses and
elephants, his treasury house, his friends and relatives, and his undisputed kingdom.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
To become liberated means to become free from dehatma-buddhi, the illusory attachment for personal
bodily coverings and everything connected with the body, namely wife, children and all other
entanglements. One selects a wife for bodily comforts, and the result is children. For wife and children
one requires a dwelling place, and as such a residential house is also necessary. Animals like horses,
elephants, cows and dogs are all household animals, and a householder has to keep them as household
paraphernalia. In modern civilization the horses and elephants have been replaced by cars and
conveyances with considerable horsepower. To maintain all the household affairs, one has to increase the
bank balance and be careful about the treasury house, and in order to display the opulence of material
assets, one has to keep good relations with friends and relatives, as well as become very careful about
maintaining the status quo. This is called material civilization of material attachment. Devotion for Lord
Krsna means negation of all material attachments as detailed above. By the grace of Lord Krsna, Maharaja
Pariksit was awarded all material amenities and an undisputed kingdom in which to enjoy the
undisturbed position of king, but by the grace of the Lord he was able to give up all connections with
material attachment. That is the position of a pure devotee. Maharaja Pariksit, due to his natural affection
for Lord Krsna as a devotee of the Lord, was always executing his royal duties on behalf of the Lord, and
as a responsible king of the world he was always careful to see that the influence of Kali would not enter
his kingdom. A devotee of the Lord never thinks of his household paraphernalia as his own, but
surrenders everything for the service of the Lord. Thereby living entities under a devotee's care get the
opportunity for God realization by the management of a devotee-master.
Attachment for household paraphernalia and for Lord Krsna go poorly together. One attachment is the
path of darkness, and the other attachment is the path of light. Where there is light, there is no darkness,
and where there is darkness, there is no light. But an expert devotee can turn everything to the path of
light by an attitude of service to the Lord, and the best example here is the Pandavas. Maharaja
Yudhisthira and householders like him can turn everything to light by dovetailing so-called material assets
in the service of the Lord, but one who is not trained or is unable to turn everything to the service of the
Lord (nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe) must give up all material connections before he can be fit to hear
and chant the glories of the Lord, or in other words, one who has seriously heard Srimad-Bhagavatam for
even one day, like Maharaja Pariksit, from a fit personality like Sukadeva Gosvami, may be able to lose all
affinity for material things. There is no utility simply in imitating Maharaja Pariksit and hearing
Bhagavatam from professional men, even for seven hundred years. To take Srimad-Bhagavatam as a means
of maintaining family expenditure is the grossest type of namaparadha offense at the feet of the Lord
(sarva-subha-kriya-samyam api pramadah).
