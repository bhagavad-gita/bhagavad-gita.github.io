rajya-kamo manun devan
nirrtim tv abhicaran yajet
kama-kamo yajet somam
akamah purusam param
SYNONYMS
rajya-kamah--anyone desiring an empire or kingdom; manun--the Manus, semi-incarnations of God;
devan--demigods; nirrtim--demons; tu--but; abhicaran--desiring victory over the enemy; yajet--should
worship; kama-kamah--one who desires sense gratification; yajet--should worship; somam--the demigod
named Candra; akamah--one who has no material desires to be fulfilled; purusam--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; param--the Supreme.
TRANSLATION
One who desires domination over a kingdom or an empire should worship the Manus. One who desires
victory over an enemy should worship the demons, and one who desires sense gratification should
worship the moon. But one who desires nothing of material enjoyment should worship the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
For a liberated person, all the enjoyments listed above are considered to be absolutely useless. Only
those who are conditioned by the material modes of external energy are captivated by different types of
material enjoyment. In other words, the transcendentalist has no material desires to be fulfilled, whereas
the materialist has all types of desires to be fulfilled. The Lord has proclaimed that the materialists, who
desire material enjoyment and thus seek the favor of different demigods, as above mentioned, are not in
control of their senses and so give themselves to nonsense. One should therefore not desire any sort of
material enjoyment, being sensible enough to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The leaders
of nonsensical persons are still more nonsensical because they preach openly and foolishly that one can
worship any form of demigod and get the same result. This sort of preaching is not only against the
teachings of the Bhagavad-gita, or those of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, but is also foolish, just as it is foolish
to claim that with the purchase of any travel ticket one may reach the same destination. No one can reach
Bombay from Delhi by purchasing a ticket for Baroda. It is clearly defined herein that persons
impregnated with different desires have different modes of worship, but one who has no desire for
material enjoyment should worship the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead. And this
worshiping process is called devotional service. Pure devotional service means service to the Lord without
any tinge of material desires, including desire for fruitive activity and empiric speculation. For fulfillment
of material desires one may worship the Supreme Lord, but the result of such worship is different, as will
be explained in the next verse. Generally the Lord does not fulfill anyone's material desires for sense
enjoyment, but He awards such benedictions to worshipers of the Lord, for they ultimately come to the
point of not desiring material enjoyment. The conclusion is that one must minimize the desires for
material enjoyment, and for this one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is
described here as param, or beyond anything material. Sripada Sankaracarya has also stated, narayanah
paro 'vyaktat: the Supreme Lord is beyond the material encirclement.
