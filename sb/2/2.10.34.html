<h2>Text</h2>
atah param suksmatamam
avyaktam nirvisesanam
anadi-madhya-nidhanam
nityam van-manasah param
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atah--therefore; param--transcendental; suksmatamam--finer than the finest; avyaktam--unmanifested;
nirvisesanam--without material features; anadi--without beginning; madhya--without an intermediate
stage; nidhanam--without end; nityam--eternal; vak--words; manasah--of the mind; param--
transcendental.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore beyond this [gross manifestation] is a transcendental manifestation finer than the finest form.
It has no beginning, no intermediate stage and no end; therefore it is beyond the limits of expression or
mental speculation and is distinct from the material conception.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The gross external body of the Supreme is manifested at certain intervals, and thus the external feature
or form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not the eternal form of the Lord, which has no
beginning, no intermediate stage and no end. Anything which has a beginning, interim and end is called
material. The material world is begun from the Lord, and thus the form of the Lord, before the beginning
of the material world, is certainly transcendental to the finest, or the finer material conception. The ether
in the material world is considered to be the finest. Finer than the ether is mind, intelligence, and false
ego. But all eight of the outward coverings are explained as outer coverings of the Absolute Truth. The
Absolute Truth is therefore beyond the expression and speculation of the material conception. He is
certainly transcendental to all material conceptions. This is called nirvisesanam. One should not,
however, misunderstand nirvisesanam as being without any transcendental qualifications. Visesanam
means qualities. Therefore nir added to it means that he has no material qualities or variegatedness. This
nullifying expression is described in four transcendental qualifications, namely unmanifested,
transcendental, eternal, and beyond the conception of mind or word. Beyond the limits of words means
negation of the material conception. Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to know the
transcendental form of the Lord.
