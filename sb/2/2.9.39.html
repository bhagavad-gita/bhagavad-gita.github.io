<h2>Translation</h2>
On the disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who is the object of transcendental
enjoyment for the senses of devotees, Brahma, with folded hands, began to re-create the universe, full
with living entities, as it was previously.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme personality of Godhead, Hari, is the object for fulfilling the senses of all living entities.
Illusioned by the glaring reflection of the external energy, the living entities worship the senses instead of
engaging them properly in fulfilling the desires of the Supreme.
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya (13.2) there is the following verse:
aksnoh phalam tvadrsa-darsanam hi
tanoh phalam tvadrsa-gatra-sangah
jihva-phalam tvadrsa-kirtanam hi
sudurlabha bhagavata hi loke
"O devotee of the Lord, the purpose of the visual sense is fulfilled simply by seeing you, and to touch
your body is the fulfillment of bodily touch. The tongue is meant for glorifying your qualities because in
this world a pure devotee of the Lord is very difficult to find."
Originally the senses of the living entity were awarded for this purpose, namely to engage them in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord or that of His devotees, but the conditioned souls, illusioned by
the material energy, became captivated by sense enjoyment. Therefore the whole process of God
consciousness is meant to rectify the conditional activities of the senses and to re-engage them in the
direct service of the Lord. Lord Brahma thus engaged his senses in the Lord by re-creating the conditioned
living entities to act in the re-created universe. This material universe is thus created and annihilated by
the will of the Lord. It is created to give the conditioned soul a chance to act to return home, back to
Godhead, and servants like Brahmaji, Naradaji, Vyasaji and their company become busy with the same
purpose of the Lord: to reclaim the conditioned souls from the field of sense gratification and return them
to the normal stage of engaging the senses in service of the Lord. Instead of doing so, i.e. converting the
actions of the senses, the impersonalists began to make the conditioned souls sense-less, and the Lord also
senseless. That is improper treatment for the conditioned souls. The diseased condition of the senses may
be treated by curing the defect, but not uprooting the senses altogether. When there is some disease in the
eyes, the eyes may be cured to see properly. Plucking out the eyes is no treatment. Similarly, the whole
material disease is based on the process of sense gratification, and liberation from the diseased condition
is re-engagement of the senses to see the beauty of the Lord, hear His glories, and act on His account.
Thus Brahmaji created the universal activities again.
