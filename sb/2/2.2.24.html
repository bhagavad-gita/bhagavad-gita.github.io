TRANSLATION
This gigantic manifestation of the phenomenal material world as a whole is the personal body of the
Absolute Truth, wherein the universal resultant past, present and future of material time is experienced.
PURPORT
Anything, either material or spiritual, is but an expansion of the energy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (13.13), the omnipotent Lord has His transcendental eyes,
heads and other bodily parts distributed everywhere. He can see, hear, touch or manifest Himself
anywhere and everywhere, for He is present everywhere as the Supersoul of all infinitesimal souls,
although He has His particular abode in the absolute world. The relative world is also His phenomenal
representation because it is nothing but an expansion of His transcendental energy. Although He is in His
abode, His energy is distributed everywhere, just as the sun is localized as well as expanded everywhere,
since the rays of the sun, being nondifferent from the sun, are accepted as expansions of the sun disc. In
the Visnu Purana (1.22.52) it is said that as fire expands its rays and heat from one place, similarly the
Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead, expands Himself by His manifold energy everywhere and
anywhere. The phenomenal manifestation of the gigantic universe is only a part of His virat body. Less
intelligent men cannot conceive of the transcendental all-spiritual form of the Lord, but they are
astounded by His different energies, just as the aborigines are struck with wonder by the manifestation of
lightning, a gigantic mountain or a hugely expanded banyan tree. The aborigines praise the strength of the
tiger and the elephant because of their superior energy and strength. The asuras cannot recognize the
existence of the Lord, although there are vivid descriptions of the Lord in the revealed scriptures,
although the Lord incarnates and exhibits His uncommon strength and energy, and although He is
accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by learned scholars and saints like Vyasadeva, Narada,
Asita and Devala in the past and by Arjuna in the Bhagavad-gita, as also by the acaryas like Sankara,
Ramanuja, Madhva and Lord Sri Caitanya in the modern age. The asuras do not accept any evidential
proof from the revealed scriptures, nor do they recognize the authority of the great acaryas. They want to
see with their own eyes at once. Therefore they can see the gigantic body of the Lord as virat, which will
answer their challenge, and since they are accustomed to paying homage to superior material strength like
that of the tiger, elephant and lightning, they can offer respect to the virat-rupa. Lord Krsna, by the
request of Arjuna, exhibited His virat-rupa for the asuras. A pure devotee of the Lord, being
unaccustomed to looking into such a mundane gigantic form of the Lord, requires special vision for the
purpose. The Lord, therefore, favored Arjuna with special vision for looking into His virat-rupa, which is
described in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita. This virat-rupa of the Lord was especially
manifested, not for the benefit of Arjuna, but for that unintelligent class of men who accept anyone and
everyone as an incarnation of the Lord and so mislead the general mass of people. For them, the
indication is that one should ask the cheap incarnation to exhibit his virat-rupa and thus be established as
an incarnation. The virat-rupa manifestation of the Lord is simultaneously a challenge to the atheist and a
favor for the asuras, who can think of the Lord as virat and thus gradually cleanse the dirty things from
their hearts in order to become qualified to actually see the transcendental form of the Lord in the near
future. This is a favor of the all-merciful Lord to the atheists and the gross materialists.
