bhagavata--by the Personality of Godhead; uditam--enlightened; sangrahah--is the accumulation of;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Narada, this science of God, Srimad-Bhagavatam, was spoken to me in summary by the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and it was spoken as the accumulation of His diverse potencies. Please expand
this science yourself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Bhagavatam in a nutshell, spoken by the Personality of Godhead in about half a dozen verses,
which will appear ahead, is the science of God, and it is the potent representation of the Personality of
Godhead. He, being absolute, is nondifferent from the science of God, Srimad-Bhagavatam. Brahmaji
received this science of Godhead from the Lord directly, and he handed over the same to Narada, who in
his turn ordered Srila Vyasadeva to expand it. So the transcendental knowledge of the Supreme Lord is
not mental speculation by the mundane wranglers, but is uncontaminated, eternal, perfect knowledge
beyond the jurisdiction of material modes. The Bhagavata purana is therefore the direct incarnation of the
Lord in the form of transcendental sound, and one should receive this transcendental knowledge from the
bona fide representative of the Lord in the chain of disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmaji, from
Brahmaji to Narada, from Narada to Vyasa, from Vyasadeva to Sukadeva Gosvami, from Sukadeva
Gosvami to Suta Gosvami. The ripened fruit of the Vedic tree drops from one hand to another without
being broken by falling suddenly from a high branch down to the earth. Therefore unless one hears the
science of Godhead from the bona fide representative of the disciplic succession, as above mentioned, for
one to understand the theme of the science of Godhead will be a difficult job. It should never be heard
from the professional Bhagavatam reciters who earn their livelihood by gratifying the senses of the
audience.
