TRANSLATION
The gigantic universal form of the Personality of Godhead, within the body of the universal shell, which
is covered by sevenfold material elements, is the subject for the virat conception.
PURPORT
Simultaneously, the Lord has multifarious other forms, and all of them are identical with the original
fountainhead form of the Lord, Sri Krsna. In the Bhagavad-gita, it has been proven that the original
transcendental and eternal form of the Lord is Sri Krsna, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, but by His
inconceivable internal potency, atma-maya, He can expand Himself by multifarious forms and
incarnations simultaneously, without being diminished in His full potency. He is complete, and although
innumerable complete forms emanate from Him, He is still complete, without any loss. That is His
spiritual or internal potency. In the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, the personality of Godhead,
Lord Krsna, manifested His virat-rupa just to convince the less intelligent class of men, who cannot
conceive of the Lord as appearing just like a human being, that He factually has the potency of His claim
to be the Supreme Absolute person without any rival or superior. Materialistic men can think, although
very imperfectly, of the huge universal space, comprehending an innumerable number of planets as big as
the sun. They can see only the circular sky overhead, without any information that this universe, as well
as many other hundreds of thousands of universes, are each covered by sevenfold material coverings of
water, fire, air, sky, ego, noumenon and material nature, just like a huge football, pumped and covered,
floating on the water of the Causal Ocean, wherein the Lord is lying as Maha-Visnu. All the universes in
seed are emanating from the breathing of the Maha-Visnu, who is but part of a partial expansion of the
Lord, and all the universes presided over by the Brahmas vanish when the Maha-Visnu withdraws His
great breath. In this way, the material worlds are being created and vanished by the supreme will of the
Lord. The poor foolish materialist can just imagine how ignorantly he puts forward an insignificant
creature to become His rival incarnation, simply on the allegations of a dying man. The virat-rupa was
particularly exhibited by the Lord just to give lessons to such foolish men, so that one can accept a person
as the incarnation of Godhead only if such a person is able to exhibit such a virat-rupa as Lord Krsna did.
The materialistic person may concentrate his mind upon the virat or gigantic form of the Lord in his own
interest and as recommended by Sukadeva Gosvami, but he must be on his guard not to be misled by
pretenders who claim to be the identical person as Lord Krsna but are not able to act like Him or exhibit
the virat-rupa, comprehending the whole of the universe.
