<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sound incarnation of Lord Krsna, the Supreme Soul [i.e. Srimad-Bhagavatam], enters into the heart
of a self-realized devotee, sits on the lotus flower of his loving relationship, and thus cleanses the dust of
material association, such as lust, anger and hankering. Thus it acts like autumnal rains upon pools of
muddy water.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that a single pure devotee of the Lord can deliver all the fallen souls of the world. Thus one
who is actually in the confidence of a pure devotee like Narada or Sukadeva Gosvami and thus is
empowered by one's spiritual master, as Narada was by Brahmaji, can not only deliver himself from the
clutches of maya, or illusion, but can deliver the whole world by his pure and empowered devotional
strength. The comparison to the autumnal rain that falls on muddy reservoirs of water is very appropriate.
During the rainy season, all the waters of the rivers become muddy, but in the month of July-August, the
autumn season, when there is a slight rainfall, the muddy waters of the rivers all over the world become at
once clear. By addition of some chemical, a small reservoir of water like that of a metropolitan waterworks
tank can be cleared, but by such a tiny effort it is not possible to clear up all the reservoirs of water like
the rivers. A powerful pure devotee of the Lord, however, can deliver not only his personal self but also
many others in his association.
In other words, the cleansing of the polluted heart by other methods (like the culture of empiric
knowledge or mystic gymnastics) can simply cleanse one's own heart, but devotional service to the Lord is
so powerful that it can cleanse the hearts of the people in general, by the devotional service of the pure,
empowered devotee. A true representative of the Lord like Narada, Sukadeva Gosvami, Lord Caitanya, the
six Gosvamis and later Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, etc.,
can deliver all people by their empowered devotional service.
By sincere efforts to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam one realizes his constitutional relationship with the Lord
in the transcendental humor of servitude, friendship, paternal affection or conjugal love, and by such selfrealization
one becomes situated at once in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Not only were
all the pure devotees like Narada self-realized souls, but they were engaged in preaching work
automatically by spiritual impetus, and thus they delivered many poor souls entangled in the material
modes. They became so powerful because they sincerely followed the Bhagavatam principles by regular
hearing and worshiping. By such actions the accumulated material lusts, etc., become cleansed by the
personal endeavor of the Lord within the heart. The Lord is always within the heart of the living being,
but He becomes manifested by one's devotional service.
Purification of the heart by culture of knowledge or mystic yoga may be all right for the time being for
an individual person, but it is like the cleansing of a small quantity of stagnant water by chemical
processes. Such clarification of water may stand for the time being and the sediments settle down, but by a
alight agitation everything becomes muddy. The idea is that devotional service to the Lord is the only
method of cleansing the heart for good. Whereas other methods may be superficially good for the time
being, there is a risk of becoming muddy again due to agitation of the mind. Devotional service to the
Lord, with specific attention for hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam regularly and always, is the best
recommended method for liberation from the clutches of illusion.
