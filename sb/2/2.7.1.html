<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma said: When the unlimitedly powerful Lord assumed the form of a boar as a pastime, just to
lift the planet earth, which was drowned in the great ocean of the universe called the Garbhodaka, the
first demon [Hiranyaksa] appeared, and the Lord pierced him with His tusk.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since the beginning of creation, the demons and the demigods, or the Vaisnavas, are always the two
classes of living beings to dominate the planets of the universes. Lord Brahma is the first demigod, and
Hiranyaksa is the first demon in this universe. Only under certain conditions do the planets float as
weightless balls in the air, and as soon as these conditions are disturbed, the planets may fall down in the
Garbhodaka Ocean, which covers half the universe. The other half is the spherical dome within which the
innumerable planetary systems exist. The floating of the planets in the weightless air is due to the inner
constitution of the globes, and the modernized drilling of the earth to exploit oil from within is a sort of
disturbance by the modern demons and can result in a greatly harmful reaction to the floating condition
of the earth. A similar disturbance was created formerly by the demons headed by Hiranyaksa (the great
exploiter of the gold rush), and the earth was detached from its weightless condition and fell down into
the Garbhodaka Ocean. The Lord, as maintainer of the whole creation of the material world, therefore
assumed the gigantic form of a boar with a proportionate snout and picked up the earth from within the
water of Garbhodaka. Sri Jayadeva Gosvami, the great Vaisnava poet, sang as follows:
vasati dasana-sikhare dharani tava lagna
sasini kalanka-kaleva nimagna
kesava dhrta-sukara-rupa
jaya jagadisa hare
"O Kesava! O Supreme Lord who have assumed the form of a boar! O Lord! The planet earth rested on
Your tusks, and it appeared like the moon engraved with spots."
Such is the symptom of an incarnation of the Lord. The incarnation of the Lord is not the concocted
idea of fanciful men who create an incarnation out of imagination. The incarnation of the Lord appears
under certain extraordinary circumstances like the above-mentioned occasion, and the incarnation
performs a task which is not even imaginable by the tiny brain of mankind. The modern creators of the
many cheap incarnations may take note of the factual incarnation of God as the gigantic boar with a
suitable snout to carry the planet earth.
When the Lord appeared to pick up the earth, the demon of the name Hiranyaksa tried to create a
disturbance in the methodical functions of the Lord, and therefore he was killed by being pierced by the
Lord's tusk. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the demon Hiranyaksa was killed by the hand of the Lord.
Therefore his version is that after being killed by the hand of the Lord, the demon was pierced by the
tusk. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura confirms this version.
