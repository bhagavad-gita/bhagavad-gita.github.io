TRANSLATION
The person who has not at any time received the dust of the feet of the Lord's pure devotee upon his
head is certainly a dead body. And the person who has never experienced the aroma of the tulasi leaves
from the lotus feet of the Lord is also a dead body, although breathing.
PURPORT
According to Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the breathing dead body is a ghost. When a man
dies, he is called dead, but when he again appears in a subtle form not visible to our present vision and yet
acts, such a dead body is called a ghost. Ghosts are always very bad elements, always creating a fearful
situation for others. Similarly, the ghostlike nondevotees who have no respect for the pure devotees, nor
for the Visnu Deity in the temples, create a fearful situation for the devotees at all times. The Lord never
accepts any offering by such impure ghosts. There is a common saying that one should first love the dog
of the beloved before one shows any loving sentiments for the beloved. The stage of pure devotion is
attained by sincerely serving a pure devotee of the Lord. The first condition of devotional service to the
Lord is therefore to be a servant of a pure devotee, and this condition is fulfilled by the statement
"reception of the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee who has also served another pure devotee." That
is the way of pure disciplic succession, or devotional parampara.
Maharaja Rahugana inquired from the great saint Jada Bharata as to how he had attained such a
liberated stage of a paramahamsa, and in answer the great saint replied as follows (Bhag. 5.12.12):
rahuganaitat tapasa na yati
na cejyaya nirvapanad grhad va
na cchandasa naiva jalagni-suryair
vina mahat-pada-rajo-'bhisekam
"O King Rahugana, the perfectional stage of devotional service, or the paramahamsa stage of life, cannot
be attained unless one is blessed by the dust of the feet of great devotees. It is never attained by tapasya
[austerity], the Vedic worshiping process, acceptance of the renounced order of life, the discharge of the
duties of household life, the chanting of the Vedic hymns, or the performance of penances in the hot sun,
within cold water or before the blazing fire."
In other words, Lord Sri Krsna is the property of His pure unconditional devotees, and as such only the
devotees can deliver Krsna to another devotee; Krsna is never obtainable directly. Lord Caitanya therefore
designated Himself as gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah, or "the most obedient servant of
the servants of the Lord, who maintains the gopi damsels at Vrndavana." A pure devotee therefore never
approaches the Lord directly, but tries to please the servant of the Lord's servants, and thus the Lord
becomes pleased, and only then can the devotee relish the taste of the tulasi leaves stuck to His lotus feet.
In the Brahma-samhita it is said that the Lord is never to be found by becoming a great scholar of the
Vedic literatures, but He is very easily approachable through His pure devotee. In Vrndavana all the pure
devotees pray for the mercy of Srimati Radharani, the pleasure potency of Lord Krsna. Srimati Radharani
is a tenderhearted feminine counterpart of the supreme whole, resembling the perfectional stage of the
worldly feminine nature. Therefore, the mercy of Radharani is available very readily to the sincere
devotees, and once She recommends such a devotee to Lord Krsna, the Lord at once accepts the devotee's
admittance into His association. The conclusion is, therefore, that one should be more serious about
seeking the mercy of the devotee than that of the Lord directly, and by one's doing so (by the good will of
the devotee) the natural attraction for the service of the Lord will be revived.
