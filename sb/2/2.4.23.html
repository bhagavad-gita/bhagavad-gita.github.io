<h2>Translation</h2>
May the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who enlivens the materially created bodies of the elements by
lying down within the universe, and who in His purusa incarnation causes the living being to be subjected
to the sixteen divisions of material modes which are his generator, be pleased to decorate my statements.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As a fully dependent devotee, Sukadeva Gosvami (unlike a mundane man who is proud of his own
capability) invokes the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead so that his statements may be successful
and be appreciated by the hearers. The devotee always thinks of himself as instrumental for anything
successfully carried out, and he declines to take credit for anything done by himself. The godless atheist
wants to take all credit for activities, not knowing that even a blade of grass cannot move without the
sanction of the Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead. Sukadeva Gosvami therefore wants to move
by the direction of the Supreme Lord, who inspired Brahma to speak the Vedic wisdom. The truths
described in the Vedic literatures are not theories of mundane imagination, nor are they fictitious, as the
less intelligent class of men sometimes think. The Vedic truths are all perfect descriptions of the factual
truth without any mistake or illusion, and Sukadeva Gosvami wants to present the truths of creation not
as a metaphysical theory of philosophical speculation, but as the actual facts and figures of the subject,
since he would be dictated to by the Lord exactly in the same manner as Brahmaji was inspired. As stated
in the Bhagavad-gita (15.15), the Lord is Himself the father of the Vedanta knowledge, and it is He only
who knows the factual purport of the Vedanta philosophy. So there is no greater truth than the principles
of religion mentioned in the Vedas. Such Vedic knowledge or religion is disseminated by authorities like
Sukadeva Gosvami because he is a humble devotional servitor of the Lord who has no desire to become a
self-appointed interpreter without authority. That is the way of explaining the Vedic knowledge,
technically known as the parampara system, or descending process.
The intelligent man can see without mistake that any material creation (whether one's own body or a
fruit or flower) cannot beautifully grow up without the spiritual touch. The greatest intelligent man of the
world or the greatest man of science can present everything very beautifully only insofar as the spirit life
is there or insomuch as the spiritual touch is there. Therefore the source of all truths is the Supreme
Spirit, and not gross matter as wrongly conceived by the gross materialist. We get information from the
Vedic literature that the Lord Himself first entered the vacuum of the material universe, and thus all
things gradually developed one after another. Similarly, the Lord is situated as localized Paramatma in
every individual being; hence everything is done by Him very beautifully. The sixteen principal creative
elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, and the eleven sense organs, first developed from the Lord
Himself and were thereby shared by the living entities. Thus the material elements were created for the
enjoyment of the living entities. The beautiful arrangement behind all material manifestations is therefore
made possible by the energy of the Lord, and the individual living entity can only pray to the Lord to
understand it properly. Since the Lord is the supreme entity, different from Sukadeva Gosvami, the prayer
can be offered to Him. The Lord helps the living entity to enjoy material creation, but He is aloof from
such false enjoyment. Sukadeva prays for the mercy of the Lord, not only for being helped personally in
presenting the truth, but also for helping others to whom he would like to speak.
