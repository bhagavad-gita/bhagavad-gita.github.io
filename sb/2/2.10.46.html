<h2>Translation</h2>
This process of creation and annihilation described in summary herein is the regulative principle during
the duration of Brahma's one day. It is also the regulative principle in the creation of mahat, in which the
material nature is dispersed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three different types of creation, called maha-kalpa, vikalpa and kalpa. In the maha-kalpa the
Lord assumes the first purusa incarnation as Karanodakasayi Visnu with all the potencies of the mahattattva
and the sixteen principles of creative matter and instruments. The creative instruments are eleven,
the ingredients are five, and all of them are products of mahat, or materialistic ego. These creations by the
Lord in His feature of Karanodakasayi Visnu are called maha-kalpa. The creation of Brahma and
dispersion of the material ingredients are called vikalpa, and the creation by Brahma in each day of his life
is called kalpa. Therefore each day of Brahma is called a kalpa, and there are thirty kalpas in terms of
Brahma's days. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (8.17) as follows:
sahasra-yuga-paryantam
ahar yad brahmano viduh
ratim yuga-sahasrantam
te 'ho-ratra-vido janah
In the upper planetary system the duration of one complete day and night is equal to one complete year
of this earth. This is accepted even by the modern scientist and attested by the astronauts. Similarly, in the
region of still higher planetary systems the duration of day and night is still greater than in the heavenly
planets. The four yugas are calculated in terms of the heavenly calendars and accordingly are twelve
thousand years in terms of the heavenly planets. This is called a divya-yuga, and one thousand divyayugas
make one day of Brahma. The creation during the day of Brahma is called kalpa, and the creation of
Brahma is called vikalpa. When vikalpas are made possible by the breathing of Maha-Visnu, this is called a
maha-kalpa. There are regular and systematic cycles of these maha-kalpas, vikalpas and kalpas. In answer
to Maharaja Pariksit's question about them, Sukadeva Gosvami answered in the Prabhasa-khanda of the
Skanda Purana. They are as follows:
prathamah sveta-kalpas ca
dvitiyo nila-lohitah
vamadevas trtiyas tu
tato gathantaro 'parah
rauravah pancamah proktah
sasthah prana iti smrtah
saptamo 'tha brhat-kalpah
kandarpo 'stama ucyate
sadyotha navamah kalpa
isano dasamah smrtah
dhyana ekadasah proktas
tatha sarasvato 'parah
trayodasa udanas tu
garudo 'tha caturdasah
kaurmah pancadaso jneyah
paurnamasi prajapateh
sodaso narasimhas tu
samadhis tu tato 'parah
agneyo visnujah saurah
soma-kalpas tato 'parah
dvavimso bhavanah proktah
supuman iti caparah
vaikunthas carstisas tadvad
vali-kalpas tato 'parah
saptavimso 'tha vairajo
gauri-kalpas tathaparah
mahesvaras tatha proktas
tripuro yatra ghatitah
pitr-kalpas tatha cante
yah kuhur brahmanah smrta
Therefore the thirty kalpas of Brahma are: (1) Sveta-kalpa, (2) Nilalohita, (3) Vamadeva, (4) Gathantara,
(5) Raurava, (6) Prana, (7) Brhat-kalpa, (8) Kandarpa, (9) Sadyotha, (10) Isana, (11) Dhyana, (12)
Sarasvata, (13) Udana, (14) Garuda, (15) Kaurma, (16) Narasimha, (17) Samadhi, (18) Agneya, (19)
Visnuja, (20) Saura, (21) Soma-kalpa, (22) Bhavana, (23) Supuma, (24) Vaikuntha, (25) Arcisa, (26) Valikalpa,
(27) Vairaja, (28) Gauri-kalpa, (29) Mahesvara, (30) Paitr-kalpa.
These are Brahma's days only, and he has to live months and years up to one hundred, so we can just
imagine how many creations there are in kalpas only. Then again there are vikalpas, which are generated
by the breathing of Maha-Visnu, as stated in the Brahma-samhita (yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagadanda-nathah). The Brahmas live only during the breathing period of Maha-Visnu.
So the exhaling and inhaling of Visnu are maha-kalpas, and all these are due to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, for no one else is the master of all creations.
