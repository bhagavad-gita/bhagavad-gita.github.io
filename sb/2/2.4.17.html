<h2>Translation</h2>
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Sri Krsna again and again because
the great learned sages, the great performers of charity, the great workers of distinction, the great
philosophers and mystics, the great chanters of the Vedic hymns and the great followers of Vedic
principles cannot achieve any fruitful result without dedication of such great qualities to the service of the
Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Advancement of learning, a charitable disposition, political, social or religious leadership of human
society, philosophical speculations, the practice of the yoga system, expertise in the Vedic rituals, and all
similar high qualities in man serve one in the attainment of perfection only when they are employed in
the service of the Lord. Without such dovetailing, all such qualities become sources of trouble for people
in general. Everything can be utilized either for one's own sense gratification or in the service of one other
than oneself. There are two kinds of self-interest also, namely personal selfishness and extended
selfishness. But there is no qualitative difference between personal and extended selfishness. Theft for
personal interest or for the family interest is of the same quality--namely, criminal. A thief pleading not
guilty because of committing theft not for personal interest but for the interest of society or country has
never been excused by the established law of any country. People in general have no knowledge that the
self-interest of a living being attains perfection only when such an interest coincides with the interest of
the Lord. For example, what is the interest of maintaining body and soul together? One earns money for
maintenance of the body (personal or social), but unless there is God consciousness, unless the body is
being properly maintained to realize one's relation with God, all good efforts to maintain body and soul
together are similar to the attempts of the animals to maintain body and soul together. The purpose of
maintaining the human body is different from that of the animals. Similarly, advancement of learning,
economic development, philosophical research, study in the Vedic literature or even the execution of
pious activities (like charity, opening of hospitals, and the distribution of food grains) should be done in
relation with the Lord. The aim of all such acts and endeavors must be the pleasure of the Lord and not
the satisfaction of any other identity, individual or collective (samsiddhir hari-tosanam). In the Bhagavadgita
(9.27) the same principle is confirmed where it is said that whatever we may give in charity and
whatever we may observe in austerity must be given over to the Lord or be done on His account only. The
expert leaders of a godless human civilization cannot bring about a fruitful result in all their different
attempts at educational advancement or economic development unless they are God conscious. And to
become God conscious one has to hear about the all-auspicious Lord, as He is described in literature like
the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.
