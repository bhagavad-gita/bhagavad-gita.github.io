TRANSLATION
Both by rising and by setting, the sun decreases the duration of life of everyone, except one who utilizes
the time by discussing topics of the all-good Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
This verse indirectly confirms the greater importance of utilizing the human form of life to realize our
lost relationship with the Supreme Lord by acceleration of devotional service. Time and tide wait for no
man. So the time indicated by the sunrise and the sunset will be uselessly wasted if such time is not
properly utilized for realizing identification of spiritual values. Even a fraction of the duration of life
wasted cannot be compensated by any amount of gold. Human life is simply awarded to a living entity
(jiva) so that he can realize his spiritual identity and his permanent source of happiness. A living being,
especially the human being, is seeking happiness because happiness is the natural situation of the living
entity. But he is vainly seeking happiness in the material atmosphere. A living being is constitutionally a
spiritual spark of the complete whole, and his happiness can be perfectly perceived in spiritual activities.
The Lord is the complete spirit whole, and His name, form, quality, pastimes, entourage and personality
are all identical with Him. Once a person comes into contact with any one of the above-mentioned
energies of the Lord through the proper channel of devotional service, the door to perfection is
immediately opened. In the Bhagavad-gita (2.40) the Lord has explained such contact in the following
words: "Endeavors in devotional service are never baffled. Nor is there failure. A slight beginning of such
activities is sufficient even to deliver a person from the great ocean of material fears." As a highly potent
drug injected intravenously acts at once on the whole body, the transcendental topics of the Lord injected
through the ear of the pure devotee of the Lord can act very efficiently. Aural realization of the
transcendental messages implies total realization, just as fructification of one part of a tree implies
fructification of all other parts. This realization for a moment in the association of pure devotees like
Sukadeva Gosvami prepares one's complete life for eternity. And thus the sun fails to rob the pure devotee
of his duration of life, inasmuch as he is constantly busy in the devotional service of the Lord, purifying
his existence. Death is a symptom of the material infection of the eternal living being; only due to material
infection is the eternal living entity subjected to the law of birth, death, old age and disease.
The materialistic way of pious activities like charity is recommended in the smrti-sastras as quoted by
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura. Money given in charity to a suitable person is guaranteed bank
balance in the next life. Such charity is recommended to be given to a brahmana. If the money is given in
charity to a non-brahmana (without brahminical qualification) the money is returned in the next life in
the same proportion. If it is given in charity to a half-educated brahmana, even then the money is
returned double. If the money is given in charity to a learned and fully qualified brahmana, the money is
returned a hundred and a thousand times, and if the money is given to a veda-paraga (one who has
factually realized the path of the Vedas), it is returned by unlimited multiplication. The ultimate end of
Vedic knowledge is realization of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita
(vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah). There is a guarantee of money's being returned if given in charity,
regardless of the proportion. Similarly, a moment passed in the association of a pure devotee by hearing
and chanting the transcendental messages of the Lord is a perfect guarantee for eternal life, for returning
home, back to Godhead. Mad-dhama gatva punar janma na vidyate. In other words, a devotee of the Lord
is guaranteed eternal life. A devotee's old age or disease in the present life is but an impetus to such
guaranteed eternal life.
