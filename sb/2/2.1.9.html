<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
parinisthito 'pi nairgunya
uttama-sloka-lilaya
grhita-ceta rajarse
akhyanam yad adhitavan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
parinisthitah--fully realized; api--in spite of; nairgunye--in transcendence; uttama--enlightened; sloka--
verse; lilaya--by the pastimes; grhita--being attracted; cetah--attention; rajarse--O saintly King;
akhyanam--delineation; yat--that; adhitavan--I have studied.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O saintly King, I was certainly situated perfectly in transcendence, yet I was still attracted by the
delineation of the pastimes of the Lord, who is described by enlightened verses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Absolute Truth is realized as the impersonal Brahman at the first instance by philosophical
speculation and later as the Supersoul by further progress of transcendental knowledge. But if, by the
grace of the Lord, an impersonalist is enlightened by the superior statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam, he is
also converted into a transcendental devotee of the Personality of Godhead. With a poor fund of
knowledge, we cannot adjust to the idea of the personality of the Absolute Truth, and the personal
activities of the Lord are deplored by the less intelligent impersonalists; but reasons and arguments
together with the transcendental process of approaching the Absolute Truth help even the staunch
impersonalist to become attracted by the personal activities of the Lord. A person like Sukadeva Gosvami
cannot be attracted by any mundane activity, but when such a devotee is convinced by a superior method,
he is certainly attracted by the transcendental activities of the Lord. The Lord is transcendental, as are His
activities. He is neither inactive nor impersonal.
