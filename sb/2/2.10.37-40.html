<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, know from me that all living entities are created by the Supreme Lord according to their past
deeds. This includes Brahma and his sons like Daksa, the periodical heads like Vaivasvata Manu, the
demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuna, the great sages like Bhrgu, Vyasa and Vasistha, the inhabitants
of Pitrloka and Siddhaloka, the Caranas, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Asuras, Yaksas, Kinnaras and angels,
the serpentines, the monkey-shaped Kimpurusas, the human beings, the inhabitants of Matrloka, the
demons, Pisacas, ghosts, spirits, lunatics and evil spirits, the good and evil stars, the goblins, the animals
in the forest, the birds, the household animals, the reptiles, the mountains, the moving and standing
living entities, the living entities born from embryos, from eggs, from perspiration and from seeds, and all
others, whether they be in the water, land or sky, in happiness, in distress or in mixed happiness and
distress. All of them, according to their past deeds, are created by the Supreme Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The varieties of living entities are mentioned in this list, and, with no exception from the topmost planet
down to the lowest planet of the universe, all of them in different species of life are created by the
Almighty Father, Visnu. Therefore no one is independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
Bhagavad-gita (14.4) the Lord therefore claims all living entities as His offspring in the following verse:
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
The material nature is compared to the mother. Although every living being is seen to come out of the
mother's body, it is still a fact that the mother is not the ultimate cause of such a birth. The father is the
ultimate cause of birth. Without the father's seed, no mother can give birth to a child. Therefore the living
beings in different varieties of forms and positions within the innumerable universes are all born of the
seeds of the Almighty Father, the Personality of Godhead, and only to the man with a poor fund of
knowledge they appear to be born of the material nature. Being under the material energy of the Supreme
Lord, all living entities beginning from Brahma down to the insignificant ant are manifested in different
bodies according to their past deeds.
The material nature is one of the energies of the Lord (Bg. 7.4). The material nature is inferior in
comparison to the living entities, the superior nature. The superior nature and inferior nature of the Lord
combine to manifest all universal affairs.
Some of the living entities are relatively happy in better conditions of life, whereas others are in
distressed conditions of life. But factually, none of them are actually happy in material conditional life. No
one can be happy in prison life, although one may be a first-class prisoner and another a third-class
prisoner. The intelligent person should not try to be promoted from third-class prison life to first-class
prison life, but should try to be released from the prison altogether. One may be promoted to first-class
prisoner, but the same first-class prisoner is again degraded to a third-class prisoner in the next term. One
should try to be free from prison life and go back home, back to Godhead. That is the real goal for all
types of living entities.
