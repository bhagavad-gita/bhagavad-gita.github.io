<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord Himself in His incarnation as the son of Satyavati [Vyasadeva] will consider his compilation of
the Vedic literature to be very difficult for the less intelligent persons with short life, and thus He will
divide the tree of Vedic knowledge into different branches, according to the circumstances of the
particular age.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Herein Brahma mentions the future compilation of Srimad-Bhagavatam for the short-lived persons of
the Kali age. As explained in the First Canto, the less intelligent persons of the age of Kali would be not
only short-lived, but also perplexed with so many problems of life due to the awkward situation of the
godless human society. Advancement of material comforts of the body is activity in the mode of ignorance
according to the laws of material nature. Real advancement of knowledge means progress of knowledge in
self-realization. But in the age of Kali the less intelligent men mistakenly consider the short lifetime of one
hundred years (now factually reduced to about forty or sixty years) to be all in all. They are less intelligent
because they have no information of the eternity of life; they identify with the temporary material body
existing for forty years and consider it the only basic principle of life. Such persons are described as equal
to the asses and bulls. But the Lord, as the compassionate father of all living beings, imparts unto them
the vast Vedic knowledge in short treatises like the Bhagavad-gita and, for the graduates, the Srimad-
Bhagavatam. The Puranas and the Mahabharata are also similarly made by Vyasadeva for the different
types of men in the modes of material nature. But none of them are independent of the Vedic principles.
