TRANSLATION
Therefore it is best for me to surrender unto His feet, which alone can deliver one from the miseries of
repeated birth and death. Such surrender is all-auspicious and allows one to perceive all happiness. Even
the sky cannot estimate the limits of its own expansion. So what can others do when the Lord Himself is
unable to estimate His own limits?
PURPORT
Lord Brahma, the greatest of all learned living beings, the greatest sacrificer, the greatest observer of the
austere life, and the greatest self-realized mystic, advises us, as the supreme spiritual master of all living
beings, that one should simply surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord in order to achieve all success,
even up to the limit of being liberated from the miseries of material life and being endowed with allauspicious
spiritual existence. Lord Brahma is known as the pitamaha, or the father's father. A young man
consults his experienced father about discharging his duties. So the father is naturally a good advisor. But
Lord Brahma is the father of all fathers. He is the father of the father of Manu, who is the father of
mankind all over the universal planets. Therefore the men of this insignificant planet should kindly accept
the instruction of Brahmaji and would do well to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord rather than try
to estimate the length and breadth of the Lord's potencies. His potencies are immeasurable, as confirmed
in the Vedas. Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8).
He is the greatest of all, and all others, even the greatest of all living beings, namely Brahmaji, admits that
the best thing for us is to surrender unto Him. Therefore only those persons with a very poor fund of
knowledge claim that they themselves are lords of all that they survey. And what can they survey? They
cannot survey even the length and breadth of a small sky in one small universe. The so-called material
scientist says that he would need to live forty thousand years to reach the highest planet of the universe,
being carried by a sputnik. This is also utopian because no one can be expected to live forty thousand
years. Besides, when the space pilot returned from his travel, none of his friends would be present to
receive him back as the greatest astronaut, as has become fashionable for modern bewildered scientific
men. One scientific man, who had no belief in God, was very much enthusiastic in making plans for his
material existence and therefore opened a hospital to save the living. But after opening the hospital, he
himself died within six months. So one should not spoil his human life, species of life, simply for the
concocted material happiness of life through increasing artificial needs in the name of advancement of
economic development and scientific knowledge. Rather, one should simply surrender unto the feet of the
Lord to make a solution to all miseries of life. That is the instruction of Lord Krsna directly in the
Bhagavad-gita, and that is the instruction of Srimad-Bhagavatam by Brahmaji, the supreme father of all
living beings.
Anyone denying this surrendering process as recommended both in the Bhagavad-gita and in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam--and, for that matter, in all authorized scriptures--will be forced to surrender unto the
laws of material nature. The living entity, by his constitutional position, is not independent. He must
surrender, either unto the Lord or unto material nature. Material nature is also not independent of the
Lord, since the Lord Himself has claimed material nature as mama maya, or "My energy" (Bg. 7.14), and
as me bhinna prakrtir astadha, or "My separated energy in eight divisions" (Bg. 7.4). Therefore material
nature is also controlled by the Lord, as He has claimed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10). Mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sacaracaram: "Under My direction only is material nature working, and thus are all things
moving." And the living entities, being superior energy to matter, have choice and discrimination either to
surrender unto the Lord or to surrender unto material nature. By surrendering unto the Lord, one is
happy and liberated, but by surrendering unto material nature the living entity suffers. So the end of all
suffering means surrendering unto the Lord because the surrendering process itself is bhava-cchidam
(liberation from all material miseries), svasty-ayanam (perception of all happiness), and sumangalam (the
source of everything auspicious).
Therefore liberty, happiness and all good fortune can be attained only by surrendering unto the Lord
because He is full liberty, full happiness and full auspiciousness. Such liberation and happiness are also
unlimited, and they have been compared to the sky, although such liberation and happiness are infinitely
greater than the sky. In our present position we can simply understand the magnitude of greatness when
it is compared to the sky. We fail to measure the sky, but the happiness and liberty obtained in association
with the Lord are far greater than the sky. That spiritual happiness is so great that it cannot be measured,
even by the Lord Himself, not to speak of others.
It is said in the scriptures, brahma-saukhyam tv anantam: spiritual happiness is unlimited. Here it is said
that even the Lord cannot measure such happiness. This does not mean that the Lord cannot measure it
and is therefore imperfect in that sense. The actual position is that the Lord can measure it, but the
happiness in the Lord is also identical with the Lord on account of absolute knowledge. So the happiness
derived from the Lord may be measured by the Lord, but the happiness increases again, and the Lord
measures it again, and then again the happiness increases more and more, and the Lord measures it more
and more, and as such there is eternally a competition between increment and measurement, so much so
that the competition is never stopped, but goes on unlimitedly ad infinitum. Spiritual happiness is
anandambudhi-vardhanam, or the ocean of happiness which increases. The material ocean is stagnant,
but the spiritual ocean is dynamic. In the Caitanya-caritamrta, (Adi-lila, Fourth Chapter) Kaviraja
Gosvami has very nicely described this dynamic increment of the ocean of spiritual happiness in the
transcendental person of Srimati Radharani, the pleasure potency of Lord Krsna.
