kridan vane nisi nisakara-rasmi-gauryam
rasonmukhah kala-padayata-murcchitena
uddipita-smara-rujam vraja-bhrd-vadhunam
hartur harisyati siro dhanadanugasya
SYNONYMS
kridan--while engaged in His pastimes; vane--in the forest of Vrndavana; nisi--nocturnal; nisakara--the
moon; rasmi-gauryam--white moonshine; rasa-unmukhah--desiring to dance with; kala-padayata--
accompanied by sweet songs; murcchitena--and melodious music; uddipita--awakened; smara-rujam--
sexual desires; vraja-bhrt--the inhabitants of Vrajabhumi; vadhunam--of the wives; hartuh--of the
kidnappers; harisyati--will vanquish; sirah--the head; dhanada-anugasya--of the follower of the rich
Kuvera.
TRANSLATION
When the Lord was engaged in His pastimes of the rasa dance in the forest of Vrndavana, enlivening the
sexual desires of the wives of the inhabitants of Vrndavana by sweet and melodious songs, a demon of the
name Sankhacuda, a rich follower of the treasurer of heaven [Kuvera], kidnapped the damsels, and the
Lord severed his head from his trunk.
PURPORT
We should carefully note that the statements described herein are the statements of Brahmaji to Narada,
and he was speaking to Narada of events that would happen in the future, during the advent of Lord
Krsna. The pastimes of the Lord are known to the experts who are able to see past, present and future,
and Brahmaji, being one of them, foretold what would happen in the future. The killing of Sankhacuda by
the Lord is a more recent incident, after the rasa-lila, and not exactly a simultaneous affair. In the previous
verses we have seen also that the Lord's engagement in the affairs of the forest fire was described along
with His pastimes of punishing the Kaliya snake, and similarly the pastimes of the rasa dance and the
killing of Sankhacuda are also described herein. The adjustment is that all these incidents would take
place in the future, after the time when it was being foretold by Brahmaji to Narada. The demon
Sankhacuda was killed by the Lord during His pastimes at Horika in the month of Phalguna, and the same
ceremony is still observed in India by the burning of the effigy of Sankhacuda one day prior to the Lord's
pastimes at Horika, generally known as Holi.
Generally the future appearance and the activities of the Lord or His incarnations are foretold in the
scriptures, and thus the pseudoincarnations are unable to cheat persons who are in knowledge of the
events as they are described in the authoritative scriptures.

TRANSLATION
All demonic personalities like Pralamba, Dhenuka, Baka, Kesi, Arista, Canura, Mustika, Kuvalayapida
elephant, Kamsa, Yavana, Narakasura and Paundraka, great marshals like Salva, Dvivida monkey and
Balvala, Dantavakra, the seven bulls, Sambara, Viduratha and Rukmi, as also great warriors like Kamboja,
Matsya, Kuru, Srnjaya and Kekaya, would all fight vigorously, either with the Lord Hari directly or with
Him under His names of Baladeva, Arjuna, Bhima, etc. And the demons, thus being killed, would attain
either the impersonal brahmajyoti or His personal abode in the Vaikuntha planets.
PURPORT
All manifestations, in both the material and spiritual worlds, are demonstrations of the different
potencies of Lord Krsna. The Personality of Godhead Baladeva is His immediate personal expansion, and
Bhima, Arjuna, etc., are His personal associates. The Lord would appear (and He does so whenever He
appears) with all His associates and potencies. Therefore the rebellious souls, like the demons and
demoniac men, mentioned by names like Pralamba, would be killed either by the Lord Himself or by His
associates. All these affairs will be clearly explained in the Tenth Canto. But we should know well that all
the above-mentioned living entities killed would attain salvation either by being merged in the
brahmajyoti of the Lord or being allowed to enter into the abodes of the Lord called Vaikunthas. This has
already been explained by Bhismadeva (First Canto). All persons who participated in the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra or otherwise with the Lord or with Baladeva, etc., would benefit by attaining spiritual
existence according to the situation of their minds at the time of death. Those who recognized the Lord
would enter Vaikuntha, and those who estimated the Lord as only a powerful being would attain salvation
by merging into the spiritual existence of the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord. But every one of them
would get release from material existence. Since such is the benefit of those who played with the Lord
inimically, one can imagine what would be the position of those who devoutly served the Lord in
transcendental relationship with Him.
