<h2>Translation</h2>
Due to His causeless mercy upon all living entities within the universe, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, along with His plenary extensions, appeared in the family of Maharaja Iksvaku as the Lord of
His internal potency, Sita. Under the order of His father, Maharaja Dasaratha, He entered the forest and
lived there for considerable years with His wife and younger brother. Ravana, who was very materially
powerful, with ten heads on his shoulders, committed a great offense against Him and was thus ultimately
vanquished.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Rama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His brothers, namely Bharata, Laksmana and
Satrughna, are His plenary expansions. All four brothers are visnu-tattva and were never ordinary human
beings. There are many unscrupulous and ignorant commentators on Ramayana who present the younger
brothers of Lord Ramacandra as ordinary living entities. But here in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the most
authentic scripture on the science of Godhead, it is clearly stated that His brothers were His plenary
expansions. Originally Lord Ramacandra is the incarnation of Vasudeva, Laksmana is the incarnation of
Sankarsana, Bharata is the incarnation of Pradyumna, and Satrughna is the incarnation of Aniruddha,
expansions of the Personality of Godhead. Laksmiji Sita is the internal potency of the Lord and is neither
an ordinary woman nor the external potency incarnation of Durga. Durga is the external potency of the
Lord, and she is associated with Lord Siva.
As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (4.7), the Lord appears when there are discrepancies in the discharge of
factual religion. Lord Ramacandra also appeared under the same circumstances, accompanied by His
brothers, who are expansions of the Lord's internal potency, and by Laksmiji Sitadevi.
Lord Ramacandra was ordered by His father, Maharaja Dasaratha, to leave home for the forest under
awkward circumstances, and the Lord, as the ideal son of His father, carried out the order, even on the
occasion of His being declared the King of Ayodhya. One of His younger brothers, Laksmanaji, desired to
go with Him, and so also His eternal wife, Sitaji, desired to go with Him. The Lord agreed to both of them,
and all together they entered the Dandakaranya Forest, to live there for fourteen years. During their stay
in the forest, there was some quarrel between Ramacandra and Ravana, and the latter kidnapped the
Lord's wife, Sita. The quarrel ended in the vanquishing of the greatly powerful Ravana, along with all his
kingdom and family.
Sita is Laksmiji, or the goddess of fortune, but she is never to be enjoyed by any living being. She is
meant for being worshiped by the living being along with her husband, Sri Ramacandra. A materialistic
man like Ravana does not understand this great truth, but on the contrary he wants to snatch Sitadevi
from the custody of Rama and thus incurs great miseries. The materialists, who are after opulence and
material prosperity, may take lessons from the Ramayana that the policy of exploiting the nature of the
Lord without acknowledging the supremacy of the Supreme Lord is the policy of Ravana. Ravana was very
advanced materially, so much so that he turned his kingdom, Lanka, into pure gold, or full material
wealth. But because he did not recognize the supremacy of Lord Ramacandra and defied Him by stealing
His wife, Sita, Ravana was killed, and all his opulence and power were destroyed.
Lord Ramacandra is a full incarnation with six opulences in full, and He is therefore mentioned in this
verse as kalesah, or master of all opulence.
