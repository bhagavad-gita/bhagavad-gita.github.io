yasmin karma-samavayo
yatha yenopagrhyate
gunanam guninam caiva
parinamam abhipsatam
SYNONYMS
yasmin--in which; karma--actions; samavayah--accumulation; yatha--as far as; yena--by which;
upagrhyate--takes over; gunanam--of the different modes of material nature; guninam--of the living
beings; ca--also; eva--certainly; parinamam--resultant; abhipsatam--of the desires.
TRANSLATION
Then again, kindly describe how the proportionate accumulation of the reactions resulting from the
different modes of material nature act upon the desiring living being, promoting or degrading him among
the different species of life, beginning from the demigods down to the most insignificant creatures.
PURPORT
The actions and reactions of all works in the material modes of nature, either in the minute form or in
the gigantic form, are accumulated, and thus the result of such accumulated actions and reactions of
karma, or work, become manifested in the same proportion. How such actions and reactions take place,
what the different procedures are, and in what proportion they act are all subject matters of Maharaja
Pariksit's inquiries from the great brahmana Sukadeva Gosvami.
Life in the higher planets, known as the abodes of the denizens of heaven, is obtained not by the
strength of spacecraft (as is now being contemplated by the inexperienced scientists), but by works done
in the mode of goodness.
Even on the very planet where we are now living, there are restrictions upon the entrance of foreigners
into a country where the citizens are more prosperous. For example, the American government has many
restrictions for the entrance of foreigners from less prosperous countries. The reason is that the Americans
do not wish to share their prosperity with any foreigner who has not qualified himself as a citizen of
America. Similarly, the same mentality is prevailing in every other planet where there are more intelligent
living beings residing. The higher planetary living conditions are all in the mode of goodness, and anyone
desiring to enter the higher planets like the moon, sun and Venus must qualify thoroughly by activity in
complete goodness.
Maharaja Pariksit's inquiries are on the basis of proportionate actions of goodness which qualify one in
this planet to be promoted to the highest regions of the universe.
Even on this planet of our present residence, one cannot achieve a good position within the social order
without being qualified with proportionate good work. One cannot forcibly sit on the chair of a highcourt
judge without being qualified for the post. Similarly, one cannot enter into the higher planetary
systems without being qualified by good works in this life. Persons addicted to the habits of passion and
ignorance have no chance of entering the higher planetary systems simply by an electronic mechanism.
According to the statement of the Bhagavad-gita (9.25), persons trying to qualify themselves for
promotion to the higher, heavenly planets can go there; similarly, persons trying for the Pitrlokas can go
there; similarly, persons trying to improve the conditions on this earth can also do that, and persons who
are engaged in going back home, back to Godhead, can achieve that result. The various actions and
reactions of work in the mode of goodness are generally known as pious work with devotional service,
culture of knowledge with devotional service, mystic powers with devotional service and (at last)
devotional service unmixed with any other varieties of goodness. This unmixed devotional service is
transcendental and is called para bhakti. It alone can promote a person to the transcendental kingdom of
God. Such a transcendental kingdom is not a myth, but is as factual as the moon. One must have
transcendental qualities to understand the kingdom of God and God Himself.
