<h2>Translation</h2>
O Narada, because I have caught hold of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari,
with great zeal, whatever I say has never proved to have been false. Nor is the progress of my mind ever
deterred. Nor are my senses ever degraded by temporary attachment to matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma is the original speaker of Vedic wisdom to Narada, and Narada is the distributor of
transcendental knowledge all over the world through his various disciples, like Vyasadeva and others. The
followers of Vedic wisdom accept the statements of Brahmaji as gospel truth, and transcendental
knowledge is thus being distributed all over the world by the process of disciplic succession from time
immemorial, since the beginning of the creation. Lord Brahma is the perfect liberated living being within
the material world, and any sincere student of transcendental knowledge must accept the words and
statements of Brahmaji as infallible. The Vedic knowledge is infallible because it comes down directly
from the Supreme Lord unto the heart of Brahma, and since he is the most perfect living being, Brahmaji
is always correct to the letter. And this is because Lord Brahma is a great devotee of the Lord who has
earnestly accepted the lotus feet of the Lord as the supreme truth. In the Brahma-samhita, which is
compiled by Brahmaji, he repeats the aphorism govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami: "I am a
worshiper of the original personality of Godhead, Govinda, the primeval Lord." So whatever he says,
whatever he thinks, and whatever he does normally in his mood are to be accepted as truth because of his
direct and very intimate connection with Govinda, the primeval Lord. Sri Govinda, who pleasingly accepts
the loving transcendental service of His devotees, gives all protection to the words and actions of His
devotees. The Lord declares in the Bhagavad-gita (9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi: "O son of Kunti, please
declare it." The Lord asks Arjuna to declare, and why? Because sometimes the declaration of Govinda
Himself may seem contradictory to mundane creatures, but the mundaner will never find any
contradiction in the words of the Lord's devotees. The devotees are especially protected by the Lord so
that they may remain infallible. Therefore the process of devotional service always begins in the service of
the devotee who appears in disciplic succession. The devotees are always liberated, but that does not
mean that they are impersonal. The Lord is a person eternally, and the devotee of the Lord is also a person
eternally. Because the devotee has his sense organs even at the liberated stage, he is therefore a person
always. And because the devotee's service is accepted by the Lord in full reciprocation, the Lord is also a
person in His complete spiritual embodiment. The devotee's senses, being engaged in the service of the
Lord, never go astray under the attraction of false material enjoyment. The plans of the devotee never go
in vain, and all this is due to the faithful attachment of the devotee for the service of the Lord. This is the
standard of perfection and liberation. Anyone, beginning from Brahmaji down to the human being, is at
once put on the path of liberation simply by his attachment in great earnestness for the Supreme Lord, Sri
Krsna, the primeval Lord. The Lord affirms this in the Bhagavad-gita (14.26):
mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena
bhakti-yogena sevate
sa gunan samatityaitan
brahma-bhuyaya kalpate
Anyone, therefore, who is earnestly serious in heart and soul about being in intimate touch with the
Personality of Godhead in the relationship of transcendental loving service will always be infallible in
words and action. The reason is that the Supreme Lord is Absolute Truth, and anything earnestly
dovetailed with the Absolute Truth attains the same transcendental quality. On the other hand, any
amount of mental speculation on the strength of material science and knowledge without any bona fide
touch with the Absolute Truth is sure to be a mundane untruth and failure, simply due to not being in
touch with the Absolute Truth. Such godless, unfaithful words and actions, however materially enriched,
are never to be trusted. That is the purport of this important verse. A grain of devotion is more valuable
than tons of faithlessness.
