TRANSLATION
Thus being fixed, one must render service unto the Supersoul situated in one's own heart by His
omnipotency. Because He is the Almighty Personality of Godhead, eternal and unlimited, He is the
ultimate goal of life, and by worshiping Him one can end the cause of the conditioned state of existence.
PURPORT
As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), the Supreme personality of Godhead Sri Krsna is the allpervading
omnipresent Supersoul. Therefore one who is a yogi can worship only Him because He is the
substance and not illusion. Every living creature is engaging in the service of something else. A living
being's constitutional position is to render service, but in the atmosphere of maya, or illusion, or the
conditional state of existence, the conditioned soul seeks the service of illusion. A conditioned soul works
in the service of his temporary body, bodily relatives like the wife and children, and the necessary
paraphernalia for maintaining the body and bodily relations, such as the house, land, wealth, society and
country, but he does not know that all such renderings of service are totally illusory. As we have
discussed many times before, this material world is itself an illusion, like a mirage in the desert. In the
desert there is an illusion of water, and the foolish animals become entrapped by such an illusion and run
after water in the desert, although there is no water at all. But because there is no water in the desert, one
does not conclude that there is no water at all. The intelligent person knows well that there is certainly
water, water in the seas and oceans, but such vast reservoirs of water are far, far away from the desert.
One should therefore search for water in the vicinity of seas and oceans and not in the desert. Every one
of us is searching after real happiness in life, namely eternal life, eternal or unlimited knowledge and
unending blissful life. But foolish people who have no knowledge of the substance search after the reality
of life in the illusion. This material body does not endure eternally, and everything in relation with this
temporary body, such as the wife, children, society and country, also changes along with the change of
body. This is called samsara, or repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. We would like to find a
solution for all these problems of life, but we do not know the way. Herein it is suggested that anyone
who wants to make an end to these miseries of life, namely repetition of birth, death, disease, and old age,
must take to this process of worshiping the Supreme Lord and not others, as it is also ultimately suggested
in the Bhagavad-gita (18.65). If we at all want to end the cause of our conditioned life, we must take to
the worship of Lord Sri Krsna, who is present in everyone's heart by His natural affection for all living
beings, who are actually the parts and parcels of the Lord (Bg. 18.61). The baby in the lap of his mother is
naturally attached to the mother, and the mother is attached to the child. But when the child grows up
and becomes overwhelmed by circumstances, he gradually becomes detached from the mother, although
the mother always expects some sort of service from the grown-up child and is equally affectionate toward
her child, even though the child is forgetful. Similarly, because we are all part and parcel of the Lord, the
Lord is always affectionate to us, and He always tries to get us back home, back to Godhead. But we, the
conditioned souls, do not care for Him and run instead after the illusory bodily connections. We must
therefore extricate ourselves from all illusory connections of the world and seek reunion with the Lord,
trying to render service unto Him because He is the ultimate truth. Actually we are hankering after Him as
the child seeks the mother. And to search out the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we need not go
anywhere else, because the Lord is within our hearts. This does not suggest, however, that we should not
go to the places of worship, namely the temples, churches and mosques. Such holy places of worship are
also occupied by the Lord because the Lord is omnipresent. For the common man these holy places are
centers of learning about the science of God. When the temples are devoid of activities, the people in
general become uninterested in such places, and consequently the mass of people gradually become
godless, and a godless civilization is the result. Such a hellish civilization artificially increases the
conditions of life, and existence becomes intolerable for everyone. The foolish leaders of a godless
civilization try to devise various plans to bring about peace and prosperity in the godless world under a
patent trademark of materialism, and because such attempts are illusory only, the people elect
incompetent, blind leaders, one after another, who are incapable of offering solutions. If we want at all to
end this anomaly of a godless civilization, we must follow the principles of revealed scriptures like the
Srimad-Bhagavatam and follow the instruction of a person like Sri Sukadeva Gosvami who has no
attraction for material gain.
