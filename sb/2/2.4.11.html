<h2>Text</h2>
suta uvaca
ity upamantrito rajna
gunanukathane hareh
hrsikesam anusmrtya
prativaktum pracakrame
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sutah uvaca--Suta Gosvami said; iti--thus; upamantritah--being requested; rajna--by the King; gunaanukathane--
in describing the transcendental attributes of the Lord; hareh--of the personality of Godhead;
hrsikesam--the master of the senses; anusmrtya--properly remembering; prativaktum--just to reply;
pracakrame--executed the preliminaries.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: When Sukadeva Gosvami was thus requested by the King to describe the creative
energy of the Personality of Godhead, he then systematically remembered the master of the senses [Sri
Krsna], and to reply properly he spoke thus.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The devotees of the Lord, while delivering speeches and describing the transcendental attributes of the
Lord, do not think that they can do anything independently. They think that they can speak only what
they are induced to speak by the Supreme Lord, the master of the senses. The senses of the individual
being are not his own; the devotee knows that such senses belong to the Supreme Lord and that they can
be properly used when they are employed for the service of the Lord. The senses are instruments, and
elements are ingredients, all endowed by the Lord; therefore whatever an individual can do, speak, see,
etc., is under the direction of the Lord only. The Bhagavad-gita (15.15) confirms this: sarvasya caham hrdi
sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca. No one is free to act freely and independently, and as
such, one should always seek the permission of the Lord to act or eat or speak, and by the blessing of the
Lord everything done by a devotee is beyond the principles of the four defects typical of the conditioned
soul.
