<h2>Translation</h2>
Kindly describe how the Supreme Lord, who is all-powerful, engages His different energies and different
expansions in maintaining and again winding up the phenomenal world in the sporting spirit of a player.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Katha Upanisad (2.2.13) the Supreme Lord is described as the chief eternal being amongst all
other eternal individual beings (nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam) and the one Supreme Lord who
maintains innumerable other individual living beings (eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman). So all living
entities, both in the conditioned state and in the liberated state, are maintained by the Almighty Supreme
Lord. Such maintenance is effected by the Lord through His different expansions of Self and three
principal energies, namely the internal, external and marginal energies. The living entities are His
marginal energies, and some of them, in the confidence of the Lord, are entrusted with the work of
creation also, as are Brahma, Marici, etc., and the acts of creation are inspired by the Lord unto them (tene
brahma hrda). The external energy (maya) is also impregnated with the jivas, or conditioned souls. The
unconditioned marginal potency acts in the spiritual kingdom, and the Lord, by His different plenary
expansions, maintains them in different transcendental relations displayed in the spiritual sky. So the one
Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in many (bahu syam), and thus all diversities are in
Him, and He is in all diversities, although He is nevertheless different from all of them. That is the
inconceivable mystic power of the Lord, and as such everything is simultaneously one with and different
from Him by His inconceivable potencies (acintya-bhedabheda-tattva).
