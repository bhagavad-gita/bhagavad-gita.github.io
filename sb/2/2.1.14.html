<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit, now your duration of life is limited to seven more days, so during this time you can
perform all those rituals which are needed for the best purpose of your next life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami, after citing the example of Maharaja Khatvanga, who prepared himself for the next
life within a very short time, encouraged Maharaja Pariksit by saying that since he still had seven days at
his disposal, he could easily take advantage of the time to prepare himself for the next life. Indirectly, the
Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit that be should take shelter of the sound representation of the Lord for the
seven days still remaining in the duration of his life and thus get himself liberated. In other words,
everyone can best prepare himself for the next life simply by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam, as it was recited
by Sukadeva Gosvami to Maharaja Pariksit. The rituals are not formal, but there are also some favorable
conditions, which are required to be carried out, as instructed hereafter.
