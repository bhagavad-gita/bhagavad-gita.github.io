<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahmaji said to Narada that his impression that Brahma was not the supreme authority in the
creation was correct. Sometimes less intelligent men have the foolish impression that Brahma is the cause
of all causes. But Narada wanted to clear the matter by the statements of Brahmaji, the supreme authority
in the universe. As the decision of the supreme court of a state is final, similarly the judgment of
Brahmaji, the supreme authority in the universe, is final in the Vedic process of acquiring knowledge. As
we have already affirmed in the previous verse, Naradaji was a liberated soul; therefore, he was not one of
the less intelligent men who accept a false god or gods in their own ways. He represented himself as less
intelligent and yet intelligently presented a doubt to be cleared by the supreme authority so that the
uninformed might take note of it and be rightly informed about the intricacies of the creation and the
creator.
In this verse Brahmaji clears up the wrong impression held by the less intelligent and affirms that he
creates the universal variegatedness after the potential creation by the glaring effulgence of Lord Sri Krsna.
Brahmaji has also separately given this statement in the samhita known as the Brahma-samhita (5.40),
where he says:
yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-kotikotisv
asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam
tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental bodily
effulgence, known as the brahmajyoti, which is unlimited, unfathomed and all-pervasive, is the cause of
the creation of unlimited numbers of planets, etc., with varieties of climates and specific conditions of
life."
The same statement is in the Bhagavad-gita (14.27). Lord Krsna is the background of the brahmajyoti
(brahmano hi pratisthaham). In the Nirukti, or Vedic dictionary, the import of pratistha is mentioned as
"that which establishes." So the brahmajyoti is not independent or self-sufficient. Lord Sri Krsna is
ultimately the creator of the brahmajyoti, mentioned in this verse as sva-rocisa, or the effulgence of the
transcendental body of the Lord. This brahmajyoti is all-pervading, and all creation is made possible by its
potential power; therefore the Vedic hymns declare that everything that exists is being sustained by the
brahmajyoti (sarvam khalv idam brahma). Therefore the potential seed of all creation is the brahmajyoti,
and the same brahmajyoti, unlimited and unfathomed, is established by the Lord. Therefore the Lord (Sri
Krsna) is ultimately the supreme cause of all creation (aham sarvasya prabhavah).
One should not expect the Lord to create like a blacksmith with a hammer and other instruments. The
Lord creates by His potencies. He has His multifarious potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate). Just
as the small seed of a banyan fruit has the potency to create a big banyan tree, the Lord disseminates all
varieties of seeds by His potential brahmajyoti (sva-rocisa), and the seeds are made to develop by the
watering process of persons like Brahma. Brahma cannot create the seeds, but he can manifest the seed
into a tree, just as a gardener helps plants and orchards to grow by the watering process. The example
cited here of the sun is very appropriate. In the material world the sun is the cause of all illumination: fire,
electricity, the rays of the moon, etc. All luminaries in the sky are creations of the sun, the sun is the
creation of the brahmajyoti, and the brahmajyoti is the effulgence of the Lord. Thus the ultimate cause of
creation is the Lord.
