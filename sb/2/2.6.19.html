<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be known as the supreme reservoir of all material opulences
by the one fourth of His energy in which all the living entities exist. Deathlessness, fearlessness and
freedom from the anxieties of old age and disease exist in the kingdom of God, which is beyond the three
higher planetary systems and beyond the material coverings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Out of the total manifestations of the sandhini energy of the Lord, one fourth is displayed in the
material world, and three fourths are displayed in the spiritual world. The Lord's energy is divided into
three component parts, namely sandhini, samvit and hladini; in other words, He is the full manifestation
of existence, knowledge and bliss. In the material world such a sense of existence, knowledge and
pleasure is meagerly exhibited, and all living entities, who are minute parts and parcels of the Lord, are
eligible to relish such consciousness of existence, knowledge and bliss very minutely in the liberated
stage, whereas in the conditioned stage of material existence they can hardly appreciate what is the
factual, existential, cognizable and pure happiness of life. The liberated souls, who exist in far greater
numerical strength than those souls in the material world, can factually experience the potency of the
above-mentioned sandhini, samvit and hladini energies of the Lord in the matter of deathlessness,
fearlessness and freedom from old age and disease.
In the material world, the planetary systems are arranged in three spheres, called triloka, or Svarga,
Martya and Patala, and all of them constitute only one fourth of the total sandhini energy. Beyond that is
the spiritual sky where the Vaikuntha planets exist beyond the coverings of seven material strata. In none
of the triloka planetary systems can one experience the status of immortality, full knowledge and full
bliss. The upper three planetary systems are called sattvika planets because they provide facilities for a
long duration of life and relative freedom from disease and old age, as well as a sense of fearlessness. The
great sages and saints are promoted beyond the heavenly planets to Maharloka, but that also is not the
place of complete fearlessness because at the end of one kalpa the Maharloka is annihilated and the
inhabitants have to transport themselves to still higher planets. Yet even on these planets no one is
immune to death. There may be a comparative extension of life, expansion of knowledge and sense of full
bliss, but factual deathlessness, fearlessness and freedom from old age, diseases, etc., are possible only
beyond the material spheres of the coverings of the material sky. Such things are situated on the head
(adhayi murdhasu).
