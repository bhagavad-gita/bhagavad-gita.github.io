<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
saunaka uvaca
ity abhivyahrtam raja
nisamya bharatarsabhah
kim anyat prstavan bhuyo
vaiyasakim rsim kavim
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
saunakah uvaca--Saunaka said; iti--thus; abhivyahrtam--all that was spoken; raja--the King; nisamya--by
hearing; bharata-rsabhah--Maharaja Pariksit; kim--what; anyat--more; prstavan--did he inquire from him;
bhuyah--again; vaiyasakim--unto the son of Vyasadeva; rsim--one who is well versed; kavim--poetic.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka said: The son of Vyasadeva, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, was a highly learned sage and was able to
describe things in a poetic manner. What did Maharaja Pariksit again inquire from him after hearing all
that he had said?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee of the Lord automatically develops all godly qualities, and some of the prominent
features of those qualities are as follows: he is kind, peaceful, truthful, equable, faultless, magnanimous,
mild, clean, nonpossessive, a well-wisher to all, satisfied, surrendered to Krsna, without hankering,
simple, fixed, self-controlled, a balanced eater, sane, mannerly, prideless, grave, sympathetic, friendly,
poetic, expert and silent. Out of these twenty-six prominent features of a devotee, as described by
Krsnadasa Kaviraja in his Caitanya-caritamrta, the qualification of being poetic is especially mentioned
herein in relation to Sukadeva Gosvami. The presentation of Srimad-Bhagavatam by his recitation is the
highest poetic contribution. He was a self-realized learned sage. In other words, he was a poet amongst
the sages.
