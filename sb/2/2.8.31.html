TRANSLATION
Lord Krsna saved His foster father, Nanda Maharaja, from the fear of the demigod Varuna and released
the cowherd boys from the caves of the mountain, for they were placed there by the son of Maya. Also, to
the inhabitants of Vrndavana, who were busy working during daytime and sleeping soundly at night
because of their hard labor in the day, Lord Krsna awarded promotion to the highest planet in the
spiritual sky. All these acts are transcendental and certainly prove without any doubt His Godhood.
PURPORT
Nanda Maharaja, the foster father of Lord Krsna, went to take his bath in the River Yamuna in the dead
of night, mistakenly thinking that the night was already over; thus the demigod Varuna took him to the
Varuna planet just to have a look at the Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna, who appeared there to release
His father. Actually there was no arrest of Nanda Maharaja by Varuna because the inhabitants of
Vrndavana were always engaged in thinking of Krsna, in constant meditation on the Personality of
Godhead in a particular form of samadhi, or trance of bhakti-yoga. They had no fear of the miseries of
material existence. In the Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that to be in association with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by full surrender in transcendental love frees one from the miseries inflicted by
the laws of material nature. Here it is clearly mentioned that the inhabitants of Vrndavana were
extensively busy in the hard labor of their day's work, and due to the day's hard labor they were engaged
in sound sleep at night. So practically they had very little time to devote to meditation or to the other
paraphernalia of spiritual activities. But factually they were engaged in the highest spiritual activities only.
Everything done by them was spiritualized because everything was dovetailed in their relationship with
Lord Sri Krsna. The central point of activities was Krsna, and as such the so-called activities in the
material world were saturated with spiritual potency. That is the advantage of the way of bhakti-yoga. One
should discharge one's duty on Lord Krsna's behalf, and all one's actions will be saturated with Krsna
thought, the highest pattern of trance in spiritual realization.
