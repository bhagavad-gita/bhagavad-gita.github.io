<h2>Translation</h2>
O sinless Brahma, you may know from Me that it was I who first ordered you to undergo penance when
you were perplexed in your duty. Such penance is My heart and soul, and therefore penance and I are
nondifferent.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The penance by which one can see the Personality of Godhead face to face is to be understood as
devotional service to the Lord and nothing else because only by discharging devotional service in
transcendental love can one approach the Lord. Such penance is the internal potency of the Lord and is
nondifferent from Him. Such acts of internal potency are exhibited by nonattachment for material
enjoyment. The living entities are encaged in the conditions of material bondage because of their
propensity for overlordship. But by engagement in the devotional service of the Lord one becomes
detached from this enjoying spirit. The devotees automatically become detached from worldly enjoyment,
and this detachment is the result of perfect knowledge. Therefore the penance of devotional service
includes knowledge and detachment, and that is the manifestation of the transcendental potency.
One cannot enjoy material illusory prosperity if he desires to return home, back to Godhead. One who
has no information of the transcendental bliss in the association of the Lord foolishly desires to enjoy this
temporary material happiness. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that if someone sincerely wants to see
the Lord and at the same time wants to enjoy this material world, he is considered to be a fool only. One
who wants to remain here in the material world for material enjoyment has no business entering into the
eternal kingdom of God. The Lord favors such a foolish devotee by snatching all that he may possess in
the material world. If such a foolish devotee of the Lord tries to recoup his position, then the merciful
Lord again snatches away all that he may have possessed. By such repeated failures in material prosperity
he becomes very unpopular with his family members and friends. In the material world the family
members and friends honor persons who are very successful in accumulating wealth by any means. The
foolish devotee of the Lord is thus put into forcible penance by the grace of the Lord, and at the end the
devotee becomes perfectly happy, being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore penance in
devotional service of the Lord, either by voluntary submission or by being forced by the Lord, is necessary
for attaining perfection, and thus such penance is the internal potency of the Lord.
One cannot, however, be engaged in the penance of devotional service without being completely free
from all sins. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, only a person who is completely free from all reactions of
sins can engage himself in the worship of the Lord. Brahmaji was sinless, and therefore he faithfully
discharged the advice of the Lord, "tapa tapa," and the Lord, being satisfied with him, awarded him the
desired result. Therefore only love and penance combined can please the Lord, and thus one is able to
attain His complete mercy. He directs the sinless, and the sinless devotee attains the highest perfection of
life.
