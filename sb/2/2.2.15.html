<h2>Translation</h2>
O King, whenever the yogi desires to leave this planet of human beings, he should not be perplexed
about the proper time or place, but should comfortably sit without being disturbed and, regulating the life
air, should control the senses by the mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita (8.14) it is clearly stated that a person who is totally engaged in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord, and who constantly remembers Him at every step, easily obtains the mercy of
the Lord by entering into His personal contact. Such devotees do not need to seek an opportune moment
to leave the present body. But those who are mixed devotees, alloyed with fruitive action or empirical
philosophical speculation, require an opportune moment for quitting this body. For them the opportune
moments are stated in the Bhagavad-gita (8.23-26). But these opportune moments are not as important as
one's being a successful yogi who is able to quit his body as he likes. Such a yogi must be competent to
control his senses by the mind. The mind is easily conquered simply by engaging it at the lotus feet of the
Lord. Gradually, by such service, all the senses become automatically engaged in the service of the Lord.
That is the way of merging into the Supreme Absolute.
