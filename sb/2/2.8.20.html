<h2>Translation</h2>
What are the opulences of the great mystics, and what is their ultimate realization? How does the
perfect mystic become detached from the subtle astral body? What is the basic knowledge of the Vedic
literatures, including the branches of history and the supplementary Puranas?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The yogesvara, or the master of mystic powers, can exhibit eight kinds of wonders of perfection by
becoming smaller than the atom or lighter than a feather, getting anything and everything he desires,
going anywhere and everywhere he likes, creating even a planet in the sky, etc. There are many yogesvaras
having different proficiencies in these wonderful powers, and the topmost of all of them is Lord Siva. Lord
Siva is the greatest yogi, and he can perform such wonderful things, far beyond the ordinary living beings.
The devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, do not directly practice the process of
mystic powers, but, by the grace of the Lord, His devotee can defeat even a great yogesvara like Durvasa
Muni, who picked a quarrel with Maharaja Ambarisa and wanted to show the wonderful achievements of
his mystic powers. Maharaja Ambarisa was a pure devotee of the Lord, and thus without any effort on his
part the Lord saved him from the wrath of Yogesvara Durvasa Muni, and the latter was obliged to beg
pardon from the King. Similarly, at the time of Draupadi's precarious position, when she was attacked by
the Kurus who wanted to see her naked in the open assembly of the royal order, the Lord saved her from
being stripped by supplying an unlimited length of sari to cover her. And Draupadi knew nothing of
mystic powers. Therefore the devotees are also yogesvaras by the unlimited power of the Lord, just as a
child is powerful by the strength of the parents. They do not try to protect themselves by any artificial
means, but are saved by the mercy of the parents.
Maharaja Pariksit inquired from the learned brahmana Sukadeva Gosvami about the ultimate
destination of such great mystics or how they attain such extraordinary powers by their own efforts or by
the grace of the Lord. He inquired also about their detachment from the subtle and gross material bodies.
He inquired also about the purports of the Vedic knowledge. As stated in the Bhagavad-gita (15.15), the
whole purport of all the Vedas is to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become a
transcendental loving servant of the Lord.
