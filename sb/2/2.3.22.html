<h2>Translation</h2>
The eyes which do not look at the symbolic representations of the Personality of Godhead Visnu [His
forms, name, quality, etc.] are like those printed on the plumes of the peacock, and the legs which do not
move to the holy places [where the Lord is remembered] are considered to be like tree trunks.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Especially for the householder devotees, the path of Deity worship is strongly recommended. As far as
possible, every householder, by the direction of the spiritual master, must install the Deity of Visnu, forms
like Radha-Krsna, Laksmi-Narayana or Sita-Rama especially, or any other form of the Lord, like Nrsimha,
Varaha, Gaura-Nitai, Matsya, Kurma, salagrama-sila and many other forms of Visnu, like Trivikrama,
Kesava, Acyuta, Vasudeva, Narayana and Damodara, as recommended in the Vaisnava-tantras or Puranas,
and one's family should worship strictly following the directions and regulations of arcana-vidhi. Any
member of the family who is above twelve years of age should be initiated by a bona fide spiritual master,
and all the members of the household should be engaged in the daily service of the Lord, beginning from
morning (4 a.m.) till night (10 p.m.) by performing mangala-aratrika, niranjana, arcana, puja, kirtana,
srngara, bhoga-vaikali, sandhya-aratrika, patha, bhoga (at night), sayana-aratrika, etc. Engagement in
such worship of the Deity, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, will greatly help the
householders to purify their very existence and make rapid progress in spiritual knowledge. Simple
theoretical book knowledge is not sufficient for a neophyte devotee. Book knowledge is theoretical,
whereas the arcana process is practical. Spiritual knowledge must be developed by a combination of
theoretical and practical knowledge, and that is the guaranteed way for attainment of spiritual perfection.
The training of devotional service for a neophyte devotee completely depends on the expert spiritual
master who knows how to lead his disciple to make gradual progress towards the path back home, back to
Godhead. One should not become a pseudo spiritual master as a matter of business to meet one's family
expenditures; one must be an expert spiritual master to deliver the disciple from the clutches of
impending death. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has defined the bona fide qualities of a spiritual
master, and one of the verses in that description reads:
sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nanasrngara-
tan-mandira-marjanadau
yuktasya bhaktams ca niyunjato 'pi
vande guroh sri-caranaravindam
Sri-vigraha is the arca, or suitable worshipable form of the Lord, and the disciple should be engaged in
worshiping the Deity regularly by srngara, by proper decoration and dressing, as also by mandira-marjana,
the matter of cleansing the temple. The spiritual master teaches the neophyte devotee all these kindly and
personally to help him gradually in the realization of the transcendental name, quality, form, etc., of the
Lord.
Only attention engaged in the service of the Lord, especially in dressing and decorating the temple,
accompanied by musical kirtana and spiritual instructions from scriptures, can save the common man
from the hellish cinema attractions and rubbish sex-songs broadcast everywhere by radios. If one is
unable to maintain a temple at home, he should go to another's temple where all the above performances
are regularly executed. Visiting the temple of a devotee and looking at the profusely decorated forms of
the Lord well dressed in a well-decorated, sanctified temple naturally infuse the mundane mind with
spiritual inspiration. People should visit holy places like Vrndavana where such temples and worship of
the Deity are specifically maintained. Formerly all rich men like kings and rich merchants constructed
such temples under the direction of expert devotees of the Lord, like the six Gosvamis, and it is the duty
of the common man to take advantage of these temples and festivals observed in the holy places of
pilgrimage by following in the footsteps of great devotees (anuvraja). One should not visit all these
sanctified pilgrimage places and temples with sightseeing in mind, but one must go to such temples and
sanctified places immortalized by the transcendental pastimes of the Lord and be guided by proper men
who know the science. This is called anuvraja. Anu means to follow. It is therefore best to follow the
instruction of the bona fide spiritual master, even in visiting temples and the holy places of pilgrimage.
One who does not move in that way is as good as a standing tree condemned by the Lord not to move.
The moving tendency of the human being is misused by visiting places for sightseeing. The best purpose
of such traveling tendencies could be fulfilled by visiting the holy places established by great acaryas and
thereby not being misled by the atheistic propaganda of moneymaking men who have no knowledge of
spiritual matters.
