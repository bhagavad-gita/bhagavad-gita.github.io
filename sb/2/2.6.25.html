tamasad api bhutader
vikurvanad abhun nabhah
tasya matra gunah sabdo
lingam yad drastr-drsyayoh
SYNONYMS
tamasat--from the darkness of false ego; api--certainly; bhuta-adeh--of the material elements;
vikurvanat--because of transformation; abhut--generated; nabhah--the sky; tasya--its; matra--subtle form;
gunah--quality; sabdah--sound; lingam--characteristics; yat--as its; drastr--the seer; drsyayoh--of what is
seen.
TRANSLATION
From the darkness of false ego, the first of the five elements, namely the sky, is generated. Its subtle
form is the quality of sound, exactly as the seer is in relationship with the seen.
PURPORT
The five elements, namely sky, air, fire, water and earth, are all but different qualities of the darkness of
false ego. This means that the false ego in the sum total form of mahat-tattva is generated from the
marginal potency of the Lord, and due to this false ego of lording it over the material creation, ingredients
are generated for the false enjoyment of the living being. The living being is practically the dominating
factor over the material elements as the enjoyer, though the background is the Supreme Lord. Factually,
save and except the Lord, no one can be called the enjoyer, but the living entity falsely desires to become
the enjoyer. This is the origin of false ego. When the bewildered living being desires this, the shadow
elements are generated by the will of the Lord, and the living entities are allowed to run after them as after
a phantasmagoria.
It is said that first the tan-matra sound is created and then the sky, and in this verse it is confirmed that
actually it is so, but sound is the subtle form of the sky, and the distinction is like that between the seer
and the seen. The sound is the representation of the actual object, as the sound produced speaking of the
object gives an idea of the description of the object. Therefore sound is the subtle characteristic of the
object. Similarly, sound representation of the Lord, in terms of His characteristics, is the complete form of
the Lord, as was seen by Vasudeva and Maharaja Dasaratha, the fathers of Lord Krsna and Lord Rama. The
sound representation of the Lord is nondifferent from the Lord Himself because the Lord and His
representation in sound are absolute knowledge. Lord Caitanya has instructed us that in the holy name of
the Lord, as sound representation of the Lord, all the potencies of the Lord are invested. Thus one can
immediately enjoy the association of the Lord by the pure vibration of the sound representation of His
holy name, and the concept of the Lord is immediately manifested before the pure devotee. A pure
devotee, therefore, is not aloof from the Lord even for a moment. The holy name of the Lord, as
recommended in the sastras--Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama Rama, Hare Hare--may therefore be constantly chanted by the devotee aspiring to be constantly in
touch with the Supreme Lord. One who is thus able to associate with the Lord is sure to be delivered from
the darkness of the created world, which is a product of false ego (tamasi ma jyotir gama).

TRANSLATION
Because the sky is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch, and by previous
succession the air is also full of sound and the basic principles of duration of life: sense perception, mental
power and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is
generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a
manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of
sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as
previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively.
PURPORT
The whole process of creation is an act of gradual evolution and development from one element to
another, reaching up to the variegatedness of the earth as so many trees, plants, mountains, rivers,
reptiles, birds, animals and varieties of human beings. The quality of sense perception is also evolutionary,
namely generated from sound, then touch, and from touch to form. Taste and odor are also generated
along with the gradual development of sky, air, fire, water and earth. They are all mutually the cause and
effect of one another, but the original cause is the Lord Himself in plenary portion, as Maha-Visnu lying in
the causal water of the mahat-tattva. As such, Lord Krsna is described in the Brahma-samhita as the cause
of all causes, and this is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (10.8) as follows:
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
The qualities of sense perception are fully represented in the earth, and they are manifested in other
elements to a lesser extent. In the sky there is sound only, whereas in the air there are sound and touch.
In the fire there are sound, touch and shape, and in the water there is taste also, along with the other
perceptions, namely sound, touch and shape. In the earth, however, there are all the above-mentioned
qualities with an extra development of odor also. Therefore on the earth there is a full display of
variegatedness of life, which is originally started with the basic principle of air. Diseases of the body take
place due to derangement of air within the earthly body of the living beings. Mental diseases result from
special derangement of the air within the body, and as such, yogic exercise is especially beneficial to keep
the air in order so that diseases of the body become almost nil by such exercises. When they are properly
done the duration of life also increases, and one can have control over death also by such practices. A
perfect yogi can have command over death and quit the body at the right moment, when he is competent
to transfer himself to a suitable planet. The bhakti-yogi, however, surpasses all the yogis because, by dint
of his devotional service, he is promoted to the region beyond the material sky and is placed in one of the
planets in the spiritual sky by the supreme will of the Lord, the controller of everything.
