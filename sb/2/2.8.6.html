<h2>Text</h2>
dhautatma purusah krsnapada-
mulam na muncati
mukta-sarva-pariklesah
panthah sva-saranam yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dhauta-atma--whose heart has been cleansed; purusah--the living being; krsna--the Supreme Personality
of Godhead; pada-mulam--the shelter of the lotus feet; na--never; muncati--gives up; mukta--liberated;
sarva--all; pariklesah--of all miseries of life; panthah--the traveler; sva-saranam--in his own abode; yatha--
as it were.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A pure devotee of the Lord whose heart has once been cleansed by the process of devotional service
never relinquishes the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, for they fully satisfy him, as a traveler is satisfied at home
after a troubled journey.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One who is not a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord Krsna is not completely cleansed in the heart. But a
perfectly cleansed person never quits the devotional service of the Lord. In discharging such devotional
service, as ordered by Brahmaji to Narada in the preaching of Srimad-Bhagavatam, sometimes a
representative of the Lord engaged in preaching work meets various so-called difficulties. This was
exhibited by Lord Nityananda when He delivered the two fallen souls Jagai and Madhai, and similarly
Lord Jesus Christ was crucified by the nonbelievers. But such difficulties are very gladly suffered by the
devotees in preaching because in such activities, although apparently very severe, the devotees of the Lord
feel transcendental pleasure because the Lord is satisfied. Prahlada Maharaja suffered greatly, but still he
never forgot the lotus feet of the Lord. This is because a pure devotee of the Lord is so purified in his heart
that he cannot leave the shelter of Lord Krsna in any circumstances. There is no self-interest in such
service. The progress of culturing knowledge by the jnanis or the bodily gymnastics by the yogis are
ultimately given up by the respective performers, but a devotee of the Lord cannot give up the service of
the Lord, for he is ordered by his spiritual master. Pure devotees like Narada and Nityananda Prabhu take
up the order of the spiritual master as the sustenance of life. They do not mind what becomes of the
future of their lives. They take the matter very seriously as the order comes from the higher authority,
from the representative of the Lord, or from the Lord Himself.
The example set herein is very appropriate. A traveler leaves home to search for wealth in far distant
places, sometimes in the forest and sometimes on the ocean and sometimes on hilltops. Certainly there
are many troubles for the traveler when he is in such unknown places. But all such troubles are at once
mitigated as soon as the sense of his family affection is remembered, and as soon as he returns home he
forgets all such troubles on the way.
A pure devotee of the Lord is exactly in a family tie with the Lord, and therefore he is undeterred in
discharging his duty in a full affectionate tie with the Lord.
