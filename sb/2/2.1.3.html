<h2>Translation</h2>
The lifetime of such an envious householder is passed at night either in sleeping or in sex indulgence,
and in the daytime either in making money or maintaining family members.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The present human civilization is primarily based on the principles of sleeping and sex indulgence at
night and earning money in the day and spending the same for family maintenance. Such a form of
human civilization is condemned by the Bhagavata school.
Because human life is a combination of matter and spirit soul, the whole process of Vedic knowledge is
directed at liberating the spirit soul from the contamination of matter. The knowledge concerning this is
called atma-tattva. Those men who are too materialistic are unaware of this knowledge and are more
inclined to economic development for material enjoyment. Such materialistic men are called karmis, or
fruitive laborers, and they are allowed regulated economic development or association of woman for sex
indulgence. Those who are above the karmis, that is, the jnanis, yogis and devotees, are strictly prohibited
from sex indulgence. The karmis are more or less devoid of atma-tattva knowledge, and as such, their life
is spent without spiritual profit. The human life is not meant for hard labor for economic development,
nor is it meant for sex indulgence like that of the dogs and hogs. It is specially meant for making a
solution to the problems of material life and the miseries thereof. So the karmis waste their valuable
human life by sleeping and sex indulgence at night, and by laboring hard in the daytime to accumulate
wealth, and after doing so, they try to improve the standard of materialistic life. The materialistic way of
life is described herein in a nutshell, and how foolishly men waste the boon of human life is described as
follows.
