<h2>Text</h2>
nama-dheyani mantras ca
daksinas ca vratani ca
devatanukramah kalpah
sankalpas tantram eva ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nama-dheyani--invoking the names of the demigods; mantrah--specific hymns to offer to a particular
demigod; ca--also; daksinah--reward; ca--and; vratani--vows; ca--and; devata-anukramah--one demigod
after another; kalpah--the specific scripture; sankalpah--the specific purpose; tantram--a particular
process; eva--as they are; ca--also.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Other necessities include invoking the different names of the demigods by specific hymns and vows of
recompense, in accordance with the particular scripture, for specific purposes and by specific processes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole process of offering sacrifice is under the category of fruitive action, and such activities are
extremely scientific. They mainly depend on the process of vibrating sounds with a particular accent. It is
a great science, and due to being out of proper use for more than four thousand years, for want of
qualified brahmanas, such performances of sacrifice are no longer effective. Nor are they recommended in
this fallen age. Any such sacrifice undertaken in this age as a matter of show may simply be a cheating
process by the clever priestly order. But such a show of sacrifices cannot be effective at any stage. Fruitive
action is being carried on by the help of material science and to a little extent by gross material help, but
the materialists await a still more subtle advancement in the process of vibrating sounds on which the
Vedic hymns are established. Gross material science cannot divert the real purpose of human life. They
can only increase the artificial needs of life without any solution to the problems of life; therefore the way
of materialistic life leads to the wrong type of human civilization. Since the ultimate aim of life is spiritual
realization, the direct way of invoking the holy name of the Lord, as mentioned above, is precisely
recommended by Lord Caitanya, and people of the modern age can easily take advantage of this simple
process, which is tenable for the condition of the complicated social structure.
