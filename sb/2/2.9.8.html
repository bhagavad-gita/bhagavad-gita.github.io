<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma underwent penances for one thousand years by the calculations of the demigods. He heard
this transcendental vibration from the sky, and he accepted it as divine. Thus he controlled his mind and
senses, and the penances he executed were a great lesson for the living entities. Thus he is known as the
greatest of all ascetics.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma heard the occult sound tapa, but he did not see the person who vibrated the sound. And
still he accepted the instruction as beneficial for him, and therefore he engaged himself in meditation for
one thousand celestial years. One celestial year is equal to 6 x 30 x 12 x 1000 of our years. His acceptance
of the sound was due to his pure vision of the absolute nature of the Lord. And due to his correct vision,
he made no distinction between the Lord and the Lord's instruction. There is no difference between the
Lord and sound vibration coming from Him, even though He is not personally present. The best way of
understanding is to accept such divine instruction, and Brahma, the prime spiritual master of everyone, is
the living example of this process of receiving transcendental knowledge. The potency of transcendental
sound is never minimized because the vibrator is apparently absent. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam or
Bhagavad-gita or any revealed scripture in the world is never to be accepted as an ordinary mundane
sound without transcendental potency.
One has to receive the transcendental sound from the right source, accept it as a reality and prosecute
the direction without hesitation. The secret of success is to receive the sound from the right source of a
bona fide spiritual master. Mundane manufactured sound has no potency, and as such, seemingly
transcendental sound received from an unauthorized person also has no potency. One should be qualified
enough to discern such transcendental potency, and either by discriminating or by fortunate chance if one
is able to receive the transcendental sound from the bona fide spiritual master, his path of liberation is
guaranteed. The disciple, however, must be ready to execute the order of the bona fide spiritual master as
Lord Brahma executed the instruction of his spiritual master, the Lord Himself. Following the order of the
bona fide spiritual master is the only duty of the disciple, and this completely faithful execution of the
order of the bona fide spiritual master is the secret of success.
Lord Brahma controlled his two grades of senses by means of sense perception and sense organs because
he had to engage such senses in the execution of the order of the Lord. Therefore controlling the senses
means engaging them in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Lord's order descends in disciplic
succession through the bona fide spiritual master, and thus execution of the order of the bona fide
spiritual master is factual control of the senses. Such execution of penance in full faith and sincerity made
Brahmaji so powerful that he became the creator of the universe. And because he was able to attain such
power, he is called the best amongst all the tapasvis.
