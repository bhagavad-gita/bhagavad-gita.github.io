<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All living beings are stated to be the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and how they are so is
explained in this verse. The four divisions of human society, namely the intelligent class (the brahmanas),
the administrative class (the ksatriyas), the mercantile class (the vaisyas), and the laborer class (the
sudras), are all in different parts of the body of the Lord. As such, no one is different from the Lord. The
mouth of the body and the legs of the body are nondifferent constitutionally, but the mouth or the head of
the body is qualitatively more important than the legs. At the same time, the mouth, the legs, the arms
and the thighs are all component parts of the body. These limbs of the body of the Lord are meant to serve
the complete whole. The mouth is meant for speaking and eating, the arms are meant for the protection of
the body, the legs are meant for carrying the body, and the waist of the body is meant for maintaining the
body. The intelligent class in society, therefore, must speak on behalf of the body, as well as accept
foodstuff to satisfy the hunger of the body. The hunger of the Lord is to accept the fruits of sacrifice. The
brahmanas, or the intelligent class, must be very expert in performing such sacrifices, and the subordinate
classes must join in such sacrifices. To speak for the Supreme Lord means to glorify the Lord by means of
propagating the knowledge of the Lord as it is, broadcasting the factual nature of the Lord and the factual
position of all other parts of the whole body. The brahmanas, therefore, are required to know the Vedas,
or the ultimate source of knowledge. Veda means knowledge, and anta means the end of it. According to
Bhagavad-gita, the Lord is the source of everything (aham sarvasya prabhavah), and thus the end of all
knowledge (Vedanta) is to know the Lord, to know our relationship with Him and to act according to that
relationship only. The parts of the body are related to the body; similarly, the living being must know his
relationship with the Lord. The human life is especially meant for this purpose, namely to know the
factual relationship of every living being with the Supreme Lord. Without knowing this relationship, the
human life is spoiled. The intelligent class of men, the brahmanas, are therefore especially responsible for
broadcasting this knowledge of our relationship with the Lord and leading the general mass of people to
the right path. The administrative class is meant for protecting the living beings so that they can serve this
purpose; the mercantile class is meant for producing food grains and distributing them to the complete
human society so that the whole population is given a chance to live comfortably and discharge the duties
of human life. The mercantile class is also required to give protection to the cows in order to get sufficient
milk and milk products, which alone can give the proper health and intelligence to maintain a civilization
perfectly meant for knowledge of the ultimate truth. And the laborer class, who are neither intelligent nor
powerful, can help by physical services to the other higher classes and thus be benefited by their
cooperation. Therefore the universe is a complete unit in relationship with the Lord, and without this
relationship with the Lord the whole human society is disturbed and is without any peace and prosperity.
This is confirmed in the Vedas: brahmano 'sya mukham asid, bahu rajanyah krtah.
