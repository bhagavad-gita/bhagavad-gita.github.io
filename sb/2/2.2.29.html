the demigods; karnau--the ears; disah--the four directions; srotram--the sense of hearing; amusya--of the

TRANSLATION
His arms are the demigods headed by Indra, the ten directional sides are His ears, and physical sound is
His sense of hearing. His nostrils are the two Asvini-kumaras, and material fragrance is His sense of smell.
His mouth is the blazing fire.
PURPORT
The description of the gigantic form of the Personality of Godhead made in the Eleventh Chapter of the
Bhagavad-gita is further explained here in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The description in the Bhagavad-gita
(11.30) runs as follows: "O Visnu, I see You devouring all people in Your blazing mouths and covering all
the universe by Your immeasurable rays. Scorching the worlds, You are manifest." In that way, SrimadBhagavatam
is the postgraduate study for the student of the Bhagavad-gita. Both of them are the science of
Krsna, the Absolute Truth, and so they are interdependent.
The conception of the virat-purusa, or the gigantic form of the Supreme Lord, is said to include all the
dominating demigods as well as the dominated living beings. Even the minutest part of a living being is
controlled by the empowered agency of the Lord. Since the demigods are included in the gigantic form of
the Lord, worship of the Lord, whether in His gigantic material conception or in His eternal
transcendental form as Lord Sri Krsna, also appeases the demigods and all the other parts and parcels, as
much as watering the root of a tree distributes energy to all of the tree's other parts. Consequently, for a
materialist also, worship of the universal gigantic form of the Lord leads one to the right path. One need
not risk being misled by approaching many demigods for fulfillment of different desires. The real entity is
the Lord Himself, and all others are imaginary, for everything is included in Him only.
