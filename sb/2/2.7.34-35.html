<h2>Translation</h2>
All demonic personalities like Pralamba, Dhenuka, Baka, Kesi, Arista, Canura, Mustika, Kuvalayapida
elephant, Kamsa, Yavana, Narakasura and Paundraka, great marshals like Salva, Dvivida monkey and
Balvala, Dantavakra, the seven bulls, Sambara, Viduratha and Rukmi, as also great warriors like Kamboja,
Matsya, Kuru, Srnjaya and Kekaya, would all fight vigorously, either with the Lord Hari directly or with
Him under His names of Baladeva, Arjuna, Bhima, etc. And the demons, thus being killed, would attain
either the impersonal brahmajyoti or His personal abode in the Vaikuntha planets.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All manifestations, in both the material and spiritual worlds, are demonstrations of the different
potencies of Lord Krsna. The Personality of Godhead Baladeva is His immediate personal expansion, and
Bhima, Arjuna, etc., are His personal associates. The Lord would appear (and He does so whenever He
appears) with all His associates and potencies. Therefore the rebellious souls, like the demons and
demoniac men, mentioned by names like Pralamba, would be killed either by the Lord Himself or by His
associates. All these affairs will be clearly explained in the Tenth Canto. But we should know well that all
the above-mentioned living entities killed would attain salvation either by being merged in the
brahmajyoti of the Lord or being allowed to enter into the abodes of the Lord called Vaikunthas. This has
already been explained by Bhismadeva (First Canto). All persons who participated in the Battlefield of
Kuruksetra or otherwise with the Lord or with Baladeva, etc., would benefit by attaining spiritual
existence according to the situation of their minds at the time of death. Those who recognized the Lord
would enter Vaikuntha, and those who estimated the Lord as only a powerful being would attain salvation
by merging into the spiritual existence of the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord. But every one of them
would get release from material existence. Since such is the benefit of those who played with the Lord
inimically, one can imagine what would be the position of those who devoutly served the Lord in
transcendental relationship with Him.
