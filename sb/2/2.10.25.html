TRANSLATION
Lord Brahma said: O Personality of Godhead, You are situated in every living entity's heart as the
supreme director, and therefore You are aware of all endeavors by Your superior intelligence, without any
hindrance whatsoever.
PURPORT
The Bhagavad-gita confirms that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart as the witness, and as such He
is the supreme director of sanction. The director is not the enjoyer of the fruits of action, for without the
Lord's sanction no one can enjoy. For example, in a prohibited area a habituated drunkard puts forward
his application to the director of drinking, and the director, considering his case, sanctions only a certain
amount of liquor for drinking. Similarly, the whole material world is full of many drunkards, in the sense
that each and every one of the living entities has something in his mind to enjoy, and everyone desires the
fulfillment of his desires very strongly. The almighty Lord, being very kind to the living entity, as the
father is kind to the son, fulfills the living entity's desire for his childish satisfaction. With such desires in
mind, the living entity does not actually enjoy, but he serves the bodily whims unnecessarily, without
profit. The drunkard does not derive any profit out of drinking, but because he has become a servant of
the drinking habit and does not wish to get out of it, the merciful Lord gives him all facilities to fulfill
such desires.
The impersonalists recommend that one should become desireless, and others recommend banishing
desires altogether. That is impossible; no one can banish desires altogether because desiring is the living
symptom. Without having desires a living entity would be dead, which he is not. Therefore, living
conditions and desire go together. perfection of desires may be achieved when one desires to serve the
Lord, and the Lord also desires that every living entity banish all personal desires and cooperate with His
desires. That is the last instruction of the Bhagavad-gita. Brahmaji agreed to this proposal, and therefore
he is given the responsible post of creating generations in the vacant universe. Oneness with the Lord
therefore consists of dovetailing one's desires with the desires of the Supreme Lord. That makes for the
perfection of all desires.
The Lord, as the Supersoul in the heart of every living being, knows what is in the mind of each living
entity, and no one can do anything without the knowledge of the Lord within. By His superior
intelligence, the Lord gives everyone the chance to fulfill his desires to the fullest extent, and the resultant
reaction is also awarded by the Lord.
