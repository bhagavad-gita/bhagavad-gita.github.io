<h2>Text</h2>
sa esa bhagaval lingais
tribhir etair adhoksajah
svalaksita-gatir brahman
sarvesam mama cesvarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He; esah--this; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; lingaih--by the symptoms; tribhih--by the
three; etaih--by all these; adhoksajah--the Superseer Transcendence; su-alaksita--veritably unseen; gatih--
movement; brahman--O Narada; sarvesam--of everyone; mama--mine; ca--as also; isvarah--the controller.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Brahmana Narada, the Superseer, the transcendent Lord, is beyond the perception of the material
senses of the living entities because of the above-mentioned three modes of nature. But He is the
controller of everyone, including me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Bhagavad-gita (7.24-25) the Lord has declared very clearly that the impersonalist, who gives more
importance to the transcendental rays of the Lord as brahmajyoti and who concludes that the Absolute
Truth is ultimately impersonal and only manifests a form at a time of necessity, is less intelligent than the
personalist, however much the impersonalist may be engaged in studying the Vedanta. The fact is that
such impersonalists are covered by the above-mentioned three modes of material nature; therefore, they
are unable to approach the transcendental Personality of the Lord. The Lord is not approachable by
everyone because He is curtained by His yogamaya potency. But one should not wrongly conclude that
the Lord was formerly unmanifested and has now manifested Himself in the human form. This
misconception of the formlessness of the Supreme personality of Godhead is due to the yogamaya curtain
of the Lord and can be removed only by the Supreme Will, as soon as the conditioned soul surrenders
unto Him. The devotees of the Lord who are transcendental to the above-mentioned three modes of
material nature can see the all-blissful transcendental form of the Lord with their vision of love in the
attitude of pure devotional service.
