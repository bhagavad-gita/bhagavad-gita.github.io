TRANSLATION
After separating the different universes, the gigantic universal form of the Lord [Maha-Visnu], which
came out of the causal ocean, the place of appearance for the first purusa-avatara, entered into each of the
separate universes, desiring to lie on the created transcendental water [Garbhodaka].
PURPORT
After analysis of the living entities and the Supreme Lord, Paramatma, the independent source of all
other living beings, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami is now presenting the prime necessity for devotional service
to the Lord, which is the only occupational business of all living entities. The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna and
all His plenary portions and extensions of plenary portions are nondifferent from one another, and thus
the supreme independence is in each and every one of them. In order to prove this, Sukadeva Gosvami (as
promised to King Pariksit) describes herein the independence of the purusa-avatara Personality of
Godhead, even in the sphere of the material creation. Such activities of the Lord are also transcendental,
and therefore they are also lila, or pastimes, of the absolute Lord. Such pastimes of the Lord are very
conducive to the hearers for self-realization in the field of devotional service. Some may argue, why not
then relish the transcendental lila of the Lord as exhibited in the land of Mathura and Vrndavana, which
are sweeter than anything in the world? Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura replies that the pastimes of
the Lord in Vrndavana are meant to be relished by advanced devotees of the Lord. Neophyte devotees will
misunderstand such supreme transcendental activities of the Lord, and therefore the Lord's pastimes in
the material sphere related to creation, maintenance and destruction are verily relishable by the prakrta,
or mundane devotees of the Lord. As the yoga system mainly based on bodily exercises is meant for the
person who is too much attached to the bodily conception of existence, similarly the Lord's pastimes
related to the creation and destruction of the material world are for those who are too materially attached.
For such mundane creatures the functions of the body and the functions of the cosmic world through
physical laws in relationship with the Lord are also therefore included in understanding of the lawmaker,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The scientists explain the material functions by so many
technological terms of material law, but such blind scientists forget the lawmaker. The Srimad-
Bhagavatam points out the lawmaker. One should not be amazed by the mechanical arrangement of the
complicated engine or dynamo, but one should praise the engineer who creates such a wonderful working
machine. That is the difference between the devotee and the nondevotee. Devotees are always full with
praising the Lord, who directs the physical laws. In the Bhagavad-gita (9.10) the direction of the Lord
upon the material nature is described as follows:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sacaracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
"The material nature full of physical laws is one of My different energies; therefore it is neither
independent nor blind. Because I am transcendentally all-powerful, simply by My glancing over material
nature, the physical laws of nature work so wonderfully. The actions and reactions of the physical laws
work on that account, and thus the material world is created, maintained and annihilated again and
again."
Men with a poor fund of knowledge, however, become astonished by studying the physical laws both
within the construction of the individual body and within the cosmic manifestation, and foolishly they
decry the existence of God, taking it for granted that the physical laws are independent, without any
metaphysical control. The Bhagavad-gita (9.11) replies to this foolishness in the following words:
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
"The foolish men [mudhah] do not know the Personality of Godhead in His eternal form of bliss and
knowledge." The foolish man thinks of the transcendental body of the Lord as something like his own,
and therefore he cannot think of the unlimited controlling power of the Lord, who is not visible in the
acting of the physical laws. The Lord is, however, visible to the naked eyes of people in general when He
descends Himself by His own personal potency. Lord Krsna incarnated Himself as He is and played very
wonderful parts as the Lord Himself, and the Bhagavad-gita concerns such wonderful actions and
knowledge. Yet foolish men will not accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Lord. Generally they consider the
infinitesimal and infinite features of the Lord because they themselves are unable to become either the
infinitesimal or the infinite, but one should know that the infinite and infinitesimal sizes of the Lord are
not His highest glories. The most wonderful manifestation of the Lord's power is exhibited when the
infinite Lord becomes visible to our eyes as one of us. Yet His activities are different from those of the
finite beings. Lifting a mountain at the age of seven years and marrying sixteen thousand wives in the
prime of His youth are some of the examples of His infinite energy, but the mudhas, after seeing them or
hearing about them, decry them as legendary and take the Lord as one of them. They cannot understand
that the Lord Sri Krsna, although in the form of a human being by His own potency, is still the Supreme
Lord with full potency as the supreme controller.
When, however, the mudhas give submissive and aural reception to the messages of the Lord as in the
Srimad Bhagavad-gita or in the Srimad-Bhagavatam through the channel of disciplic succession, such
mudhas also become devotees of the Lord by the grace of His pure devotees. And for this reason only,
either in the Bhagavad-gita or in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the pastimes of the Lord in the material world
are delineated for the benefit of those men with a poor fund of knowledge.
