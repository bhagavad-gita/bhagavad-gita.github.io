mahatas tu vikurvanad
rajah-sattvopabrmhitat
tamah-pradhanas tv abhavad
dravya-jnana-kriyatmakah
SYNONYMS
mahatah--of the mahat-tattva; tu--but; vikurvanat--being transformed; rajah--the material mode of
passion; sattva--the mode of goodness; upabrmhitat--because of being increased; tamah--the mode of
darkness; pradhanah--being prominent; tu--but; abhavat--took place; dravya--matter; jnana--material
knowledge; kriya-atmakah--predominantly material activities.
TRANSLATION
Material activities are caused by the mahat-tattva's being agitated. At first there is transformation of the
modes of goodness and passion, and later--due to the mode of ignorance--matter, its knowledge, and
different activities of material knowledge come into play.
PURPORT
Material creations of every description are more or less due to the development of the mode of passion
(rajas). The mahat-tattva is the principle of material creation, and when it is agitated by the will of the
Supreme at first the modes of passion and goodness are prominent, and afterwards the mode of passion,
being generated in due course by material activities of different varieties, becomes prominent, and the
living entities are thus involved more and more in ignorance. Brahma is the representation of the mode of
passion, and Visnu is the representation of the mode of goodness, while the mode of ignorance is
represented by Lord Siva, the father of material activities. Material nature is called the mother, and the
initiator for materialistic life is the father, Lord Siva. All material creation by the living entities is therefore
initiated by the mode of passion. With the advancement of the duration of life in a particular millennium,
the different modes act by gradual development. In the age of Kali (when the mode of passion is most
prominent) material activities of different varieties, in the name of advancement of human civilization,
take place, and the living entities become more and more involved in forgetting their real identity--the
spiritual nature. By a slight cultivation of the mode of goodness, a glimpse of spiritual nature is perceived,
but due to the prominence of the mode of passion, the mode of goodness becomes adulterated. Therefore
one cannot transcend the limits of the material modes, and therefore realization of the Lord, who is
always transcendental to the modes of material nature, becomes very difficult for the living entities, even
though prominently situated in the mode of goodness through cultivation of the various methods. In
other words, the gross matters are adhibhutam, their maintenance is adhidaivam, and the initiator of
material activities is called adhyatmam. In the material world these three principles act as prominent
features, namely as raw material, its regular supplies, and its use in different varieties of material creations
for sense enjoyment by the bewildered entities.
