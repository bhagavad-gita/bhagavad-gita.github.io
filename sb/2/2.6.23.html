<h2>Translation</h2>
When I was born from the abdominal lotus flower of the Lord [Maha-Visnu], the great person, I had no
ingredients for sacrificial performances except the bodily limbs of the great Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma, the creator of the cosmic manifestation, is known as Svayambhu, or one who is born
without father and mother. The general process is that a living creature is born out of the sex combination
of the male father and the female mother. But Brahma, the firstborn living being, is born out of the
abdominal lotus flower of the Maha-Visnu plenary expansion of Lord Krsna. The abdominal lotus flower
is part of the Lord's bodily limbs, and Brahma is born out of the lotus flower. Therefore Lord Brahma is
also a part of the Lord's body. Brahma, after his appearance in the gigantic hollow of the universe, saw
darkness and nothing else. He felt perplexity, and from his heart he was inspired by the Lord to undergo
austerity, thereby acquiring the ingredients for sacrificial performances. But there was nothing besides the
two of them, namely the Personality of Maha-Visnu and Brahma himself, born of the bodily part of the
Lord. For sacrificial performances many ingredients were in need, especially animals. The animal sacrifice
is never meant for killing the animal, but for achieving the successful result of the sacrifice. The animal
offered in the sacrificial fire is, so to speak, destroyed, but the next moment it is given a new life by dint of
the Vedic hymns chanted by the expert priest. When such an expert priest is not available, the animal
sacrifice in the fire of the sacrificial altar is forbidden. Thus Brahma created even the sacrificial ingredients
out of the bodily limbs of the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, which means that the cosmic order was created by
Brahma himself. Also, nothing is created out of nothing, but everything is created from the person of the
Lord. The Lord says in the Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate.
"Everything is made from My bodily limbs, and I am therefore the original source of all creations."
The impersonalists argue that there is no use in worshiping the Lord when everything is nothing but the
Lord Himself. The personalist, however, worships the Lord out of a great sense of gratitude, utilizing the
ingredients born out of the bodily limbs of the Lord. The fruits and flowers are available from the body of
the earth, and yet mother earth is worshiped by the sensible devotee with ingredients born from the earth.
Similarly, mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges, and yet the worshiper enjoys the result
of such worship. Worship of the Lord is also performed by the ingredients born from the bodily limbs of
the Lord, and yet the worshiper, who is himself a part of the Lord, achieves the result of devotional
service to the Lord. While the impersonalist wrongly concludes that he is the Lord himself, the
personalist, out of a great gratitude, worships the Lord in devotional service, knowing perfectly well that
nothing is different from the Lord. The devotee therefore endeavors to apply everything in the service of
the Lord because he knows that everything is the property of the Lord and that no one can claim anything
as one's own. This perfect conception of oneness helps the worshiper in being engaged in His loving
service, whereas the impersonalist, being falsely puffed up, remains a nondevotee forever, without being
recognized by the Lord.
