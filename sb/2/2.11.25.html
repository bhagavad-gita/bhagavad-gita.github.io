gatim jigisatah padau
ruruhate 'bhikamikam
padbhyam yajnah svayam havyam
karmabhih kriyate nrbhih
SYNONYMS
gatim--movement; jigisatah--so desiring; padau--the legs; ruruhate--being manifested; abhikamikam--
purposeful; padbhyam--from the legs; yajnah--Lord Visnu; svayam--personally Himself; havyam--the
duties; karmabhih--by one's occupational duty; kriyate--caused to be done; nrbhih--by different human
beings.
TRANSLATION
Thereupon, because of His desiring to control movement, His legs became manifested, and from the legs
the controlling deity named Visnu was generated. By His personal supervision of this act, all varieties of
human being are busily engaged in dutiful occupational sacrifice.
PURPORT
Every human being is engaged in his particular occupational duty, and such activities are visible as men
go hither and thither. This is very prominently visible in big cities of the world: people are going all over
the cities with great concern, from one place to another. This movement is not limited only to the cities,
but is also visible outside the cities from one place to another, or from one city to another, by different
means of vehicles. Men are moving by cars and rails on the roads, by subways within the earth and by
planes in the sky for the purpose of business success. But in all these movements the real purpose is to
earn wealth for comfortable life. For this comfortable life the scientist is engaged, the artist is engaged, the
engineer is engaged, the technician is engaged, all in different branches of human activity. But they do not
know how to make the activities purposeful to fulfill the mission of human life. Because they do not know
this secret, all their activities are targeted towards the goal of sense gratification without control, and
therefore by all this business they are unknowingly entering into the deep regions of darkness.
Because they have been captivated by the external energy of the Supreme Lord, they have completely
forgotten the Supreme Lord Visnu, and thus they have taken it for granted that this life, as presently
manifested under the conditions of material nature, is all in all for enjoying the highest amount of sense
gratification. But such a wrong conception of life cannot give anyone the desired peace of mind, and thus
in spite of all advancement in knowledge by use of the resources of nature, no one is happy in this
material civilization. The secret is that at every step they should try to execute sacrifices toward the path
of world peace. The Bhagavad-gita (18.45-46) also advises the same secret in the following verses.
sve sve karmany abhiratah
samsiddhim labhate narah
sva-karma-niratah siddhim
yatha vindati tac chrnu
yatah pravrttir bhutanam
yena sarvam idam tatam
sva-karmana tam abhyarcya
siddhim vindati manavah
The Lord said to Arjuna: "Just hear from Me how one can attain the highest perfection in life simply by
discharging his specified occupational duty. Man can attain the highest perfection of life by worshiping
the Supreme Lord and by performing sacrifice for the sake of the Supreme Lord Visnu, who is allpervading
and by whose control every living being acquires his desired facilities, according to his personal
propensity."
There is no harm in having different propensities in life because every human being is proportionately
independent to chalk out the plan of his life by different occupations, but one should make it a point in
his life to know perfectly well that he is not independent absolutely. One is certainly under the control of
the Supreme Lord and under different agencies. Knowing this, one should make it a point that by his
work and the result of his labor he serves the Supreme Lord as prescribed by the authorities expert in the
transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord Visnu. For performing such occupational duties of life
the leg is the most important instrument of the body because without the help of the legs one cannot
move from one place to another, and therefore the Lord has special control over the legs of all human
beings, which are meant for performing yajnas.
