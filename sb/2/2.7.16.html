<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, after hearing the elephant's plea, felt that the elephant needed His
immediate help, for he was in great distress. Thus at once the Lord appeared there on the wings of the
king of birds, Garuda, fully equipped with His weapon, the wheel [cakra]. With the wheel He cut to
pieces the mouth of the crocodile to save the elephant, and He delivered the elephant by lifting him by his
trunk.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord resides in His Vaikuntha planet. No one can estimate how far away this planet is situated. It is
said, however, that anyone trying to reach that planet by airships or by mindships, traveling for millions
of years, will find it still unknown. Modern scientists have invented airships which are material, and the
yogis make a still finer material attempt to travel by mindships. The yogis can reach any distant place very
quickly with the help of mindships. But neither the airship nor the mindship has access to the kingdom of
God in the Vaikunthaloka, situated far beyond the material sky. Since this is the situation, how was it
possible for the prayers of the elephant to be heard from such an unlimitedly distant place, and how could
the Lord at once appear on the spot? These things cannot be calculated by human imagination. All this
was possible by the unlimited power of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is described here as aprameya,
for not even the best human brain can estimate His powers and potencies by mathematical calculation.
The Lord can hear from such a distant place, He can eat from there, and He can appear simultaneously in
all places at a moment's notice. Such is the omnipotency of the Lord.
