<h2>Translation</h2>
Brahma, it is I, the Personality of Godhead, who was existing before the creation, when there was
nothing but Myself. Nor was there the material nature, the cause of this creation. That which you see now
is also I, the Personality of Godhead, and after annihilation what remains will also be I, the Personality of
Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We should note very carefully that the personality of Godhead is addressing Lord Brahma and
specifying with great emphasis Himself, pointing out that it is He, the Personality of Godhead, who
existed before the creation, it is He only who maintains the creation, and it is He only who remains after
the annihilation of the creation. Brahma is also a creation of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist puts
forth the theory of oneness in the sense that Brahma, also being the same principle of "I" because he is an
emanation from the I, the Absolute Truth, is identical with the Lord, the principle of I, and that there is
thus nothing more than the principle of I, as explained in this verse. Accepting the argument of the
impersonalist, it is to be admitted that the Lord is the creator I and that the Brahma is the created I.
Therefore there is a difference between the two "I's," namely the predominator I and the predominated I.
Therefore there are still two I's, even accepting the argument of the impersonalist. But we must note
carefully that these two I's are accepted in the Vedic literature (Kathopanisad) in the sense of quality. The
Kathopanisad says:
nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam
eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman
The creator "I" and the created "I" are both accepted in the Vedas as qualitatively one because both of
them are nityas and cetanas. But the singular "I" is the creator "I," and the created "I's" are of plural
number because there are many "I's" like Brahma and those generated by Brahma. It is the simple truth.
The father creates or begets a son, and the son also creates many other sons, and all of them may be one as
human beings, but at the same time from the father, the son and the grandsons are all different. The son
cannot take the place of the father, nor can the grandsons. Simultaneously the father, the son and the
grandson are one and different also. As human beings they are one, but as relativities they are different.
Therefore the relativities of the creator and the created or the predominator and the predominated have
been differentiated in the Vedas by saying that the predominator "I" is the feeder of the predominated
"I's," and thus there is a vast difference between the two principles of "I."
In another feature of this verse, no one can deny the personalities of both the Lord and Brahma.
Therefore in the ultimate issue both the predominator and predominated are persons. This conclusion
refutes the conclusion of the impersonalist that in the ultimate issue everything is impersonal. This
impersonal feature stressed by the less intelligent impersonalist school is refuted by pointing out that the
predominator "I" is the Absolute Truth and that He is a person. The predominated "I," Brahma, is also a
person, but he is not the Absolute. For realization of one's self in spiritual psychology it may be
convenient to assume oneself to be the same principle as the Absolute Truth, but there is always the
difference of the predominated and the predominator, as clearly pointed out here in this verse, which is
grossly misused by the impersonalists. Brahma is factually seeing face to face his predominator Lord, who
exists in His transcendental eternal form, even after the annihilation of the material creation. The form of
the Lord, as seen by Brahma, existed before the creation of Brahma, and the material manifestation with
all the ingredients and agents of material creation are also energetic expansions of the Lord, and after the
exhibition of the Lord's energy comes to a close, what remains is the same Personality of Godhead.
Therefore the form of the Lord exists in all circumstances of creation, maintenance and annihilation. The
Vedic hymns confirm this fact in the statement vasudevo va idam agra asin na brahma na ca sankara eko
narayana asin na brahma nesana, etc. Before the creation there was none except Vasudeva. There was
neither Brahma nor Sankara. Only Narayana was there and no one else, neither Brahma nor Isana. Sripada
Sankaracarya also confirms in his comments on the Bhagavad-gita that Narayana, or the Personality of
Godhead, is transcendental to all creation, but that the whole creation is the product of avyakta. Therefore
the difference between the created and the creator is always there, although both the creator and created
are of the same quality.
The other feature of the statement is that the supreme truth is Bhagavan, or the Personality of Godhead.
The Personality of Godhead and His kingdom have already been explained. The kingdom of Godhead is
not void as conceived by the impersonalists. The Vaikuntha planets are full of transcendental
variegatedness, including the four-handed residents of those planets, with great opulence of wealth and
prosperity, and there are even airplanes and other amenities required for high-grade personalities.
Therefore the Personality of Godhead exists before the creation, and He exists with all transcendental
variegatedness in the Vaikunthalokas. The Vaikunthalokas, also accepted in the Bhagavad-gita as being of
the sanatana nature, are not annihilated even after the annihilation of the manifested cosmos. Those
transcendental planets are of a different nature altogether, and that nature is not subjected to the rules and
regulations of material creation, maintenance or annihilation. The existence of the Personality of Godhead
implies the existence of the Vaikunthalokas, as the existence of a king implies the existence of a kingdom.
In various places in Srimad-Bhagavatam and in other revealed scriptures the existence of the Personality
of Godhead is mentioned. For example, in Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.8.10), Maharaja Pariksit asks:
sa capi yatra puruso
visva-sthity-udbhavapyayah
muktvatma-mayam mayesah
sete sarva-guhasayah
"How does the Personality of Godhead, the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation, who is
always freed from the influence of the illusory energy and is the controller of the same, lie in everyone's
heart?" Similar also is a question of Vidura's:
tattvanam bhagavams tesam
katidha pratisankramah
tatremam ka upasiran
ka u svid anuserate
(Bhag. 3.7.37)
Sridhara Svami explains this in his notes: "During the annihilation of the creation, who serves the Lord
lying on the Sesa, etc." This means that the transcendental Lord with all His name, fame, quality and
paraphernalia exists eternally. The same confirmation is also in the Kasi-khanda of the Skanda Purana in
connection with dhruva-carita. It is said there:
na cyavante 'pi yad-bhakta
mahatyam pralayapadi
ato 'cyuto 'khile loke
sa ekah sarvago 'vyayah
Even the devotees of the Personality of Godhead are not annihilated during the period of the entire
annihilation of the material world, not to speak of the Lord Himself. The Lord is ever-existent in all three
stages of material change.
The impersonalist adduces no activity in the Supreme, but in this discussion between Brahma and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead the Lord is said to have activities also, as He has His form and quality.
The activities of Brahma and other demigods during the maintenance of the creation are to be understood
as the activities of the Lord. The king, or the head executive of a state, may not be seen in the government
offices, for he may be engaged in royal comforts. Yet it should be understood that everything is being
done under his direction and everything is at his command. The Personality of Godhead is never formless.
In the material world He may not be visible in His personal form to the less intelligent class of men, and
therefore He may sometimes be called formless. But actually He is always in His eternal form in His
Vaikuntha planets as well as in other planets of the universes as different incarnations. The example of the
sun is very appropriate in this connection. The sun in the night may not be visible to the eyes of men in
the darkness, but the sun is visible wherever it has risen. That the sun is not visible to the eyes of the
inhabitants of a particular part of the earth does not mean that the sun has no form.
In the Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad (1.4.1) there is the hymn atmaivedam agra asit purusa-vidhah. This
mantra indicates the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Krsna) even before the appearance of the purusa
incarnation. In the Bhagavad-gita (15.18) it is said that Lord Krsna is Purusottama because He is the
supreme purusa, transcendental even to the purusa-aksara and the purusa-ksara. The aksara-purusa, or
the Maha-Visnu, throws His glance over prakrti, or material nature, but the Purusottama existed even
before that. The Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad therefore confirms the statement of the Bhagavad-gita that Lord
Krsna is the Supreme Person (Purusottama).
In some of the Vedas it is also said that in the beginning only the impersonal Brahman existed.
However, according to this verse, the impersonal Brahman, which is the glowing effulgence of the body of
the Supreme Lord, may be called the immediate cause, but the cause of all causes, or the remote cause, is
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord's impersonal feature is existent in the material world
because by material senses or material eyes the Lord cannot be seen or perceived. One has to spiritualize
the senses before one can expect to see or perceive the Supreme Lord. But He is always engaged in His
personal capacity, and He is eternally visible to the inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka, eye to eye. Therefore He
is materially impersonal, just as the executive head of the state may be impersonal in the government
offices, although he is not impersonal in the government house. Similarly, the Lord is not impersonal in
His abode, which is always nirasta-kuhakam, as stated in the very beginning of the Bhagavatam. Therefore
both the impersonal and personal features of the Lord are acceptable, as mentioned in the revealed
scriptures. This Personality of Godhead is very emphatically explained in the Bhagavad-gita in connection
with the verse brahmano hi pratisthaham (Bg. 14.27). Therefore in all ways the confidential part of
spiritual knowledge is realization of the Personality of Godhead, and not His impersonal Brahman feature.
One should therefore have his ultimate aim of realization not in the impersonal feature but in the personal
feature of the Absolute Truth. The example of the sky within the pot and the sky outside the pot may be
helpful to the student for his realization of the all-pervading quality of the cosmic consciousness of the
Absolute Truth. But that does not mean that the individual part and parcel of the Lord becomes the
Supreme by a false claim. It means only that the conditioned soul is a victim of the illusory energy in her
last snare. To claim to be one with the cosmic consciousness of the Lord is the last trap set by the illusory
energy, or daivi maya. Even in the impersonal existence of the Lord, as it is in the material creation, one
should aspire for personal realization of the Lord, and that is the meaning of pascad aham yad etac ca yo
'vasisyeta so 'smy aham.
Brahmaji also accepted the same truth when he was instructing Narada. He said:
so 'yam te 'bhihitas tata
bhagavan visva-bhavanah
(Bhag. 2.7.50)
There is no other cause of all causes than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. Therefore this
verse aham eva never indicates anything other than the Supreme Lord, and one should therefore follow
the path of the Brahma-sampradaya, or the path from Brahmaji to Narada, to Vyasadeva, etc., and make it
a point in life to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, or Lord Krsna. This very confidential
instruction to the pure devotees of the Lord was also given to Arjuna and to Brahma in the beginning of
the creation. The demigods like Brahma, Visnu, Mahesvara, Indra, Candra and Varuna are undoubtedly
different forms of the Lord for execution of different functions; the different elemental ingredients of
material creation, as well as the multifarious energies, also may be of the same Personality of Godhead,
but the root of all of them is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna. One should be attached to
the root of everything rather than bewildered by the branches and leaves. That is the instruction given in
this verse.
