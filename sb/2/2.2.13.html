<h2>Translation</h2>
The process of meditation should begin from the lotus feet of the Lord and progress to His smiling face.
The meditation should be concentrated upon the lotus feet, then the calves, then the thighs, and in this
way higher and higher. The more the mind becomes fixed upon the different parts of the limbs, one after
another, the more the intelligence becomes purified.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The process of meditation recommended in the Srimad-Bhagavatam is not to fix one's attention on
something impersonal or void. The meditation should concentrate on the person of the Supreme
Godhead, either in His virat-rupa, the gigantic universal form, or in His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, as
described in the scriptures. There are authorized descriptions of Visnu forms, and there are authorized
representations of Deities in the temples. Thus one can practice meditating upon the Deity, concentrating
his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord and gradually rising higher and higher, up to His smiling face.
According to the Bhagavata school, the Lord's rasa dancing is the smiling face of the Lord. Since it is
recommended in this verse that one should gradually progress from the lotus feet up to the smiling face,
we shall not jump at once to understand the Lord's pastimes in the rasa dance. It is better to practice
concentrating our attention by offering flowers and tulasi to the lotus feet of the Lord. In this way, we
gradually become purified by the arcana process. We dress the Lord, bathe Him, etc., and all these
transcendental activities help us purify our existence. When we reach the higher standard of purification,
if we see the smiling face of the Lord or hear the rasa dance pastimes of the Lord, then we can relish His
activities. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, the rasa dance pastimes are delineated in the Tenth Canto
(Chapters 29-34).
The more one concentrates on the transcendental form of the Lord, either on the lotus feet, the calves,
the thighs or the chest, the more one becomes purified. In this verse it is clearly stated, "the more the
intelligence becomes purified," which means the more one becomes detached from sense gratification.
Our intelligence in the present conditioned state of life is impure due to being engaged in sense
gratification. The result of meditation on the transcendental form of the Lord will be manifested by one's
detachment from sense gratification. Therefore, the ultimate purpose of meditation is purification of one's
intelligence.
Those who are too engrossed in sense gratification cannot be allowed to participate in arcana or to
touch the transcendental form of the Radha-Krsna or Visnu Deities. For them it is better to meditate upon
the gigantic virat-rupa of the Lord, as recommended in the next verse. The impersonalists and the voidists
are therefore recommended to meditate upon the universal form of the Lord, whereas the devotees are
recommended to meditate on the Deity worship in the temple. Because the impersonalists and the voidists
are not sufficiently purified in their spiritual activities, arcana is not meant for them.
