<h2>Translation</h2>
Please tell me so that I may be taught in the matter by the instruction of the Personality of Godhead and
may thus act instrumentally to generate living entities, without being conditioned by such activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahmaji does not want to become a speculator dependent on the strength of his personal knowledge
and conditioned to material bondage. Everyone should know in clear consciousness that one is, in the
execution of all activities, an instrument. A conditioned soul is instrumental in the hands of the external
energy, guna-mayi maya, or the illusory energy of the Lord, and in the liberated stage the living entity is
instrumental to the will of the Personality of Godhead directly. To be instrumental to the direct will of the
Lord is the natural constitutional position of the living entity, whereas to be an instrument in the hands of
the illusory energy of the Lord is material bondage for the living entity. In that conditioned state, the
living entity speculates on the Absolute Truth and His different activities. But in the unconditioned stage
the living entity directly receives knowledge from the Lord, and such a liberated soul acts flawlessly,
without any speculative habit. The Bhagavad-gita (10.10-11) confirms emphatically that the pure
devotees, who are constantly engaged in the loving transcendental service of the Lord, are directly advised
by the Lord, so much so that the devotee unwaveringly makes progress on the path home, back to
Godhead. Pure devotees of the Lord are therefore not proud of their definite progress, whereas the
nondevotee speculator is in the darkness of illusory energy and is very much proud of his misleading
knowledge based on speculation without any definite path. Lord Brahma wanted to be saved from that
pitfall of pride, although he was posted in the most exalted position within the universe.
