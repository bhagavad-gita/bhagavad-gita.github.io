<h2>Text</h2>
prajapatir dharma-patir
ekada niyaman yaman
bhadram prajanam anvicchann
atisthat svartha-kamyaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
praja-patih--the forefather of all living entities; dharma-patih--the father of religious life; ekada--once
upon a time; niyaman--rules and regulations; yaman--principles of control; bhadram--welfare; prajanam--
of the living beings; anvicchan--desiring; atisthat--situated; sva-artha--own interest; kamyaya--so desiring.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus once upon a time the forefather of living entities and the father of religiousness, Lord Brahma,
situated himself in acts of regulative principles, desiring self-interest for the welfare of all living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One cannot be situated in an exalted position without having undertaken a regulative life of rules and
regulations. An unrestricted life of sense gratification is animal life, and Lord Brahma, in order to teach all
concerned within the jurisdiction of his generations, taught the same principles of sense control for
executing higher duties. He desired the welfare of all as servants of God, and anyone desiring the welfare
of the members of his family and generations must conduct a moral, religious life. The highest life of
moral principles is to become a devotee of the Lord because a pure devotee of the Lord has all the good
qualities of the Lord. On the other hand, one who is not a devotee of the Lord, however qualified he may
be in the mundane sense of the term, cannot be qualified with any good quality worthy of the name. The
pure devotees of the Lord, like Brahma and persons in the chain of disciplic succession, do not do
anything to instruct their subordinates without acting accordingly themselves.
