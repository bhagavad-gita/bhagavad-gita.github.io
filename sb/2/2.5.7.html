<h2>Text</h2>
sa bhavan acarad ghoram
yat tapah susamahitah
tena khedayase nas tvam
para-sankam ca yacchasi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he; bhavan--your good self; acarat--undertook; ghoram--severe; yat tapah--meditation; susamahitah--
in perfect discipline; tena--for that reason; khedayase--gives pain; nah--ourselves; tvam--your
good self; para--the ultimate truth; sankam--doubts; ca--and; yacchasi--giving us a chance.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Yet we are moved to wonder about the existence of someone more powerful than you when we think of
your great austerities in perfect discipline, although your good self is so powerful in the matter of
creation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Following in the footsteps of Sri Narada Muni, one should not blindly accept his spiritual master as God
Himself. A spiritual master is duly respected on a par with God, but a spiritual master claiming to be God
Himself should at once be rejected. Narada Muni accepted Brahma as the Supreme due to Lord Brahma's
wonderful acts in creation, but doubts arose in him when he saw that Lord Brahma also worshiped some
superior authority. The Supreme is supreme, and He has no worshipable superior. The ahangrahopasita,
or the one who worships himself with the idea of becoming God Himself, is misleading, but the intelligent
disciple can at once detect that the Supreme God does not need to worship anyone, including Himself, in
order to become God. Ahangrahopasana may be one of the processes for transcendental realization, but
the ahangrahopasita can never be God Himself. No one becomes God by undergoing a process of
transcendental realization. Narada Muni thought of Brahmaji as the Supreme Person, but when he saw
Brahmaji engaged in the process of transcendental realization, doubts arose in him. So he wanted to be
clearly informed.
