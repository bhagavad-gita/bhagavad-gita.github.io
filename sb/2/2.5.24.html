<h2>Translation</h2>
The self-centered materialistic ego, thus being transformed into three features, becomes known as the
modes of goodness, passion and ignorance in three divisions, namely the powers that evolve matter,
knowledge of material creations, and the intelligence that guides such materialistic activities. Narada, you
are quite competent to understand this.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Materialistic ego, or the sense of identification with matter, is grossly self-centered, devoid of clear
knowledge of the existence of God. And this self-centered egoism of the materialistic living entities is the
cause of their being conditioned by the other paraphernalia and continuing their bondage of material
existence. In the Bhagavad-gita this self-centered egoism is very nicely explained in the Seventh Chapter
(verses 24 through 27). The self-centered impersonalist, without a clear conception of the personality of
Godhead, concludes in his own way that the personality of Godhead takes a material shape from His
original impersonal spiritual existence for a particular mission. And this misleading conception of the
Supreme Lord by the self-centered impersonalist continues, even though he is seen to be very interested
in the Vedic literatures such as the Brahma-sutras and other highly intellectual sources of knowledge.
This ignorance of the personal feature of the Lord is due simply to ignorance of the mixture of different
modes. The impersonalist thus cannot conceive of the Lord's eternal spiritual form of eternal knowledge,
bliss and existence. The reason is that the Lord reserves the right of not exposing Himself to the
nondevotee who, even after a thorough study of literature like the Bhagavad-gita, remains an
impersonalist simply by obstinacy. This obstinacy is due to the action of yogamaya, a personal energy of
the Lord that acts like an aide-de-camp by covering the vision of the obstinate impersonalist. Such a
bewildered human being is described as mudha, or grossly ignorant, because he is unable to understand
the transcendental form of the Lord as being unborn and unchangeable. If the Lord takes a form or
material shape from His original impersonal feature, then it means that He is born and changeable from
impersonal to personal. But He is not changeable. Nor does He ever take a new birth like a conditioned
soul. The conditioned soul may take a form birth after birth due to his conditional existence in matter,
but the self-centered impersonalists, by their gross ignorance, accept the Lord as one of them because of
self-centered egoism, even after so-called advancement of knowledge in the Vedanta. The Lord, being
situated in the heart of every individual living entity, knows very well the tendency of such conditioned
souls in terms of past, present and future, but the bewildered conditioned soul hardly can know Him in
His eternal form. By the will of the Lord, therefore, the impersonalist, even after knowing the Brahman
and Paramatma features of the Lord, remains ignorant of His eternal personal feature as ever-existent
Narayana, transcendental to all material creation.
The cause of such gross ignorance is constant engagement by the materialistic man in the matter of
artificially increasing material demands. To realize the Supreme personality of Godhead, one has to purify
the materialistic senses by devotional service. The mode of goodness, or the brahminical culture
recommended in the Vedic literatures, is helpful to such spiritual realization, and thus the jnana-sakti
stage of the conditioned soul is comparatively better than the other two stages, namely dravya-sakti and
kriya-sakti. The whole material civilization is manifested by a huge accumulation of materials, or, in other
words, raw materials for industrial purposes, and the industrial enterprises (kriya-sakti) are all due to
gross ignorance of spiritual life. In order to rectify this great anomaly of materialistic civilization, based on
the principles of dravya-sakti and kriya-sakti, one has to adopt the process of devotional service of the
Lord by adoption of the principles of karma-yoga, mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita (9.27) as follows:
yat karosi yad asnasi
yaj juhosi dadasi yat
yat tapasyasi kaunteya
tat kurusva mad-arpanam
"O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all
austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me."
