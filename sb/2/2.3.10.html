<h2>Translation</h2>
A person who has broader intelligence, whether he be full of all material desire, without any material
desire, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna is described in the Bhagavad-gita as purusottama,
or the Supreme Personality. It is He only who can award liberation to the impersonalists by absorbing
such aspirants in the brahmajyoti, the bodily rays of the Lord. The brahmajyoti is not separate from the
Lord, as the glowing sun ray is not independent of the sun disc. Therefore one who desires to merge into
the supreme impersonal brahmajyoti must also worship the Lord by bhakti-yoga, as recommended here in
the Srimad-Bhagavatam. Bhakti-yoga is especially stressed here as the means of all perfection. In the
previous chapters it has been stated that bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal of both karma-yoga and jnanayoga,
and in the same way in this chapter it is emphatically declared that bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal
of the different varieties of worship of the different demigods. Bhakti-yoga, thus being the supreme means
of self-realization, is recommended here. Everyone must therefore seriously take up the methods of
bhakti-yoga, even though one aspires for material enjoyment or liberation from material bondage.
Akamah is one who has no material desire. A living being, naturally being the part and parcel of the
supreme whole purusam purnam, has as his natural function to serve the Supreme Being, just as the parts
and parcels of the body, or the limbs of the body, are naturally meant to serve the complete body.
Desireless means, therefore, not to be inert like the stone, but to be conscious of one's actual position and
thus desire satisfaction only from the Supreme Lord. Srila Jiva Gosvami has explained this desirelessness
as bhajaniya-parama-purusa-sukha-matra-sva-sukhatvam in his Sandarbha. This means that one should
feel happy only by experiencing the happiness of the Supreme Lord. This intuition of the living being is
sometimes manifested even during the conditioned stage of a living being in the material world, and such
intuition is expressed in the manner of altruism, philanthropy, socialism, communism, etc., by the
undeveloped minds of less intelligent persons. In the mundane field such an outlook of doing good to
others in the form of society, community, family, country or humanity is a partial manifestation of the
same original feeling in which a pure living entity feels happiness by the happiness of the Supreme Lord.
Such superb feelings were exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabhumi for the happiness of the Lord. The
gopis loved the Lord without any return, and this is the perfect exhibition of the akamah spirit. Kama
spirit, or the desire for one's own satisfaction, is fully exhibited in the material world, whereas the spirit of
akamah is fully exhibited in the spiritual world.
Thoughts of becoming one with the Lord, or being merged in the brahmajyoti, can also be exhibitions of
kama spirit if they are desires for one's own satisfaction to be free from the material miseries. A pure
devotee does not want liberation so that he may be relieved from the miseries of life. Even without socalled
liberation, a pure devotee is aspirant for the satisfaction of the Lord. Influenced by the kama spirit,
Arjuna declined to fight in the Kuruksetra battlefield because he wanted to save his relatives for his own
satisfaction. But being a pure devotee, he agreed to fight on the instruction of the Lord because he came to
his senses and realized that satisfaction of the Lord at the cost of his own satisfaction was his prime duty.
Thus he became akama. That is the perfect stage of a perfect living being.
Udara-dhih means one who has a broader outlook. people with desires for material enjoyment worship
small demigods, and such intelligence is condemned in the Bhagavad-gita (7.20) as hrta jnana, the
intelligence of one who has lost his senses. One cannot obtain any result from demigods without getting
sanction from the Supreme Lord. Therefore a person with a broader outlook can see that the ultimate
authority is the Lord, even for material benefits. Under the circumstances, one with a broader outlook,
even with the desire for material enjoyment or for liberation, should take to the worship of the Lord
directly. And everyone, whether an akama or sakama or moksa-kama, should worship the Lord with great
expedience. This implies that bhakti-yoga may be perfectly administered without any mixture of karma
and jnana. As the unmixed sun ray is very forceful and is therefore called tivra, similarly unmixed bhaktiyoga
of hearing, chanting, etc., may be performed by one and all regardless of inner motive.
