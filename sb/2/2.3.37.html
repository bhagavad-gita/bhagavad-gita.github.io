TRANSLATION
Those who drink through aural reception, fully filled with the nectarean message of Lord Krsna, the
beloved of the devotees, purify the polluted aim of life known as material enjoyment and thus go back to
Godhead, to the lotus feet of Him [the Personality of Godhead].
PURPORT
The sufferings of human society are due to a polluted aim of life, namely lording it over the material
resources. The more human society engages in the exploitation of undeveloped material resources for
sense gratification, the more it will be entrapped by the illusory, material energy of the Lord, and thus the
distress of the world will be intensified instead of diminished. The human necessities of life are fully
supplied by the Lord in the shape of food grains, milk, fruit, wood, stone, sugar, silk, jewels, cotton, salt,
water, vegetables, etc., in sufficient quantity to feed and care for the human race of the world as well as
the living beings on each and every planet within the universe. The supply source is complete, and only a
little energy by the human being is required to get his necessities into the proper channel. There is no
need of machines and tools or huge steel plants for artificially creating comforts of life. Life is never made
comfortable by artificial needs, but by plain living and high thinking. The highest perfectional thinking
for human society is suggested here by Sukadeva Gosvami, namely, sufficiently hearing Srimad-
Bhagavatam. For men in this age of Kali, when they have lost the perfect vision of life, this Srimad-
Bhagavatam is the torchlight by which to see the real path. Srila Jiva Gosvami Prabhupada has commented
on the kathamrtam mentioned in this verse and has indicated Srimad-Bhagavatam to be the nectarean
message of the Personality of Godhead. By sufficient hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the polluted aim of
life, namely lording it over matter, will subside, and the people in general in all parts of the world will be
able to live a peaceful life of knowledge and bliss.
For a pure devotee of the Lord, any topics in relation with His name, fame, quality, entourage, etc., are
all pleasing, and because such topics have been approved by great devotees like Narada, Hanuman, Nanda
Maharaja and other inhabitants of Vrndavana, certainly such messages are transcendental and pleasing to
the heart and soul.
And by the constant hearing of the messages of the Bhagavad-gita, and later of Srimad-Bhagavatam, one
is assured herein by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami that he will reach the Personality of Godhead and render
Him transcendental loving service in the spiritual planet of the name Goloka Vrndavana, which resembles
a huge lotus flower.
Thus by the process of bhakti-yoga, directly accepted, as suggested in this verse, by sufficient hearing of
the transcendental message of the Lord, the material contamination is directly eliminated without one's
attempting to contemplate the impersonal virat conception of the Lord. And by practicing bhakti-yoga, if
the performer is not purified from the material contamination, he must be a pseudodevotee. For such an
imposter there is no remedy for being freed from material entanglement.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Second Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Lord in the Heart."
