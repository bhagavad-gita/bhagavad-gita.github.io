TRANSLATION
O Narada, you were taught about the science of God and His transcendental loving service by the
Personality of Godhead in His incarnation of Hamsavatara. He was very much pleased with you, due to
your intense proportion of devotional service. He also explained unto you, lucidly, the full science of
devotional service, which is especially understandable by persons who are souls surrendered unto Lord
Vasudeva, the Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The devotee and devotional service are two correlative terms. Unless one is inclined to be a devotee of
the Lord, he cannot enter into the intricacies of devotional service. Lord Sri Krsna wanted to explain the
Bhagavad-gita, which is the science of devotional service, unto Sri Arjuna because Arjuna was not only
His friend but a great devotee as well. The whole process is that all living entities, being constitutionally
parts and parcels of the supreme living being, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, have proportionately
minute independence of action also. So the preliminary qualification for entering into the devotional
service of the Lord is that one become a willing cooperator, and as such one should voluntarily cooperate
with persons who are already engaged in the transcendental devotional service of the Lord. By cooperating
with such persons, the prospective candidate will gradually learn the techniques of devotional service, and
with the progress of such learning one becomes proportionately free from the contamination of material
association. Such a purificatory process will establish the prospective candidate in firm faith and gradually
elevate him to the stage of transcendental taste for such devotional service. Thus he acquires a genuine
attachment for the devotional service of the Lord, and his conviction carries him on to the point of
ecstasy, just prior to the stage of transcendental love.
Such knowledge of devotional service may be divided into two sections, namely preliminary knowledge
of the nature of devotional service and the secondary knowledge of its execution. Bhagavatam is in
relation with the Personality of Godhead, His beauty, fame, opulence, dignity, attraction and
transcendental qualities which attract one towards Him for exchanges of love and affection. There is a
natural affinity of the living entity for the loving service of the Lord. This affinity becomes artificially
covered by the influence of material association, and Srimad-Bhagavatam helps one very genuinely
remove that artificial covering. Therefore it is particularly mentioned herein that Srimad-Bhagavatam acts
like the lamp of transcendental knowledge. These two sections of transcendental knowledge in devotional
service become revealed to a person who is a soul surrendered unto Vasudeva; as it is said in the
Bhagavad-gita (7.19), such a great soul, fully surrendered unto the lotus feet of Vasudeva, is very, very
rare.
