TRANSLATION
Beginning from me [Brahma] down to you and Bhava [Siva], all the great sages who were born before
you, the demigods, the demons, the Nagas, the human beings, the birds, the beasts, as well as the reptiles,
etc., and all phenomenal manifestations of the universes, namely the planets, stars, asteroids, luminaries,
lightning, thunder, and the inhabitants of the different planetary systems, namely the Gandharvas,
Apsaras, Yaksas, Raksas, Bhutaganas, Uragas, Pasus, Pitas, Siddhas, Vidyadharas, Caranas, and all other
different varieties of living entities, including the birds, beasts, trees and everything that be, are all
covered by the universal form of the Lord at all times, namely past, present and future, although He is
transcendental to all of them, eternally existing in a form not exceeding nine inches.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His partial representation, measuring not more than nine
inches as Supersoul, expands by His potential energy in the shape of the universal form, which includes
everything manifested in different varieties of organic and inorganic materials. The manifested varieties of
the universe are therefore not different from the Lord, just as golden ornaments of different shapes and
forms are nondifferent from the original stock reserve of gold. In other words, the Lord is the Supreme
Person who controls everything within the creation, and still He remains the supreme separate identity,
distinct from all manifested material creation. In the Bhagavad-gita (9.4-5) He is therefore said to be
Yogesvara. Everything rests on the potency of Lord Sri Krsna, and still the Lord is different from and
transcendental to all such identities. In the Vedic Purusa-sukta of the Rg mantra, this is also confirmed.
This philosophical truth of simultaneous oneness and difference was propounded by Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, and it is known as acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. Brahma, Narada and all others are
simultaneously one with the Lord and different from the Supreme Lord. We are all one with Him, just as
the gold ornaments are one in quality with the stock gold, but the individual gold ornament is never equal
in quantity with the stock gold. The stock gold is never exhausted even if there are innumerable
ornaments emanating from the stock because the stock is purnam, complete; even if purnam is deducted
from the purnam, still the supreme purnam remains the same purnam. This fact is inconceivable to our
present imperfect senses. Lord Caitanya therefore defined His theory of philosophy as acintya
(inconceivable), and as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita as well as in the Bhagavatam, Lord Caitanya's
theory of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva is the perfect philosophy of the Absolute Truth.
