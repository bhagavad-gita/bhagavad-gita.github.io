TRANSLATION
When there are ample earthly flats to lie on, what is the necessity of cots and beds? When one can use
his own arms, what is the necessity of a pillow? When one can use the palms of his hands, what is the
necessity of varieties of utensils? When there is ample covering, or the skins of trees, what is the necessity
of clothing?
PURPORT
The necessities of life for the protection and comfort of the body must not be unnecessarily increased.
Human energy is spoiled in a vain search after such illusory happiness. If one is able to lie down on the
floor, then why should one endeavor to get a good bedstead or soft cushion to lie on? If one can rest
without any pillow and make use of the soft arms endowed by nature, there is no necessity of searching
after a pillow. If we make a study of the general life of the animals, we can see that they have no
intelligence for building big houses, furniture, and other household paraphernalia, and yet they maintain
a healthy life by lying down on the open land. They do not know how to cook or prepare foodstuff, yet
they still live healthy lives more easily than the human being. This does not mean that human civilization
should revert to animal life or that the human being should live naked in the jungles without any culture,
education and sense of morality. An intelligent human cannot live the life of an animal; rather, man
should try to utilize his intelligence in arts and science, poetry and philosophy. In such a way he can
further the progressive march of human civilization. But here the idea given by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami is
that the reserve energy of human life, which is far superior to that of animals, should simply he utilized
for self-realization. Advancement of human civilization must be towards the goal of establishing our lost
relationship with God, which is not possible in any form of life other than the human. One must realize
the nullity of the material phenomenon, considering it a passing phantasmagoria, and must endeavor to
make a solution to the miseries of life. Self-complacence with a polished type of animal civilization geared
to sense gratification is delusion, and such a "civilization" is not worthy of the name. In pursuit of such
false activities, a human being is in the clutches of maya, or illusion. Great sages and saints in the days of
yore were not living in palatial buildings furnished with good furniture and so-called amenities of life.
They used to live in huts and groves and sit on the flat ground, and yet they have left immense treasures
of high knowledge with all perfection. Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami were high-ranking
ministers of state, but they were able to leave behind them immense writings on transcendental
knowledge, while residing only for one night underneath one tree. They did not live even two nights
under the same tree, and what to speak of well-furnished rooms with modern amenities. And still they
were able to give us most important literatures of self-realization. So-called comforts of life are not
actually helpful for progressive civilization; rather, they are detrimental to such progressive life. In the
system of sanatana-dharma, of four divisions of social life and four orders of progressive realization, there
are ample opportunities and sufficient directions for a happy termination of the progressive life, and the
sincere followers are advised therein to accept a voluntary life of renunciation in order to achieve the
desired goal of life. If one is not accustomed to abiding by the life of renunciation and self-abnegation
from the beginning, one should try to get into the habit at a later stage of life as recommended by Srila
Sukadeva Gosvami, and that will help one to achieve the desired success.
