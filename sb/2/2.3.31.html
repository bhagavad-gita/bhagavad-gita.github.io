TRANSLATION
Only the purified soul can attain the perfection of associating with the Personality of Godhead in
complete bliss and satisfaction in his constitutional state. Whoever is able to renovate such devotional
perfection is never again attracted by this material world, and he never returns.
PURPORT
We should specially note in this verse the description of gatim bhagavatim. To become merged in the
rays of the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as desired by the brahmavadi
impersonalist, is not bhagavatim perfection. The bhagavatas never accept merging in the impersonal rays
of the Lord, but always aspire after personal association with the Supreme Lord in one of the Vaikuntha
spiritual planets in the spiritual sky. The whole of the spiritual sky, of which the total number of the
material skies is only an insignificant part, is full of unlimited numbers of Vaikuntha planets. The
destination of the devotee (the bhagavata) is to enter into one of the Vaikuntha planets, in each of which
the Personality of Godhead, in His unlimited personal expansions, enjoys Himself in the association of
unlimited numbers of pure devotee associates. The conditioned souls in the material world, after gaining
emancipation by devotional service, are promoted to these planets. But the number of ever-liberated souls
is far, far greater than the number of conditioned souls in the material world, and the ever-liberated souls
in the Vaikuntha planets never care to visit this miserable material world.
The impersonalists, who aspire to merge in the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence of the Supreme Lord
but have no conception of loving devotional service to Him in His personal form in the spiritual
manifestation, may be compared to certain species of fish, who, being born in the rivers and rivulets,
migrate to the great ocean. They cannot stay in the ocean indefinitely, for their urge for sense gratification
brings them back to the rivers and streams to spawn. Similarly, when the materialist becomes frustrated in
his attempts to enjoy himself in the limited material world, he may seek impersonal liberation by merging
either with the Causal Ocean or with the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence. However, as neither the
Causal Ocean nor the impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence affords any superior substitute for association
and engagement of the senses, the impersonalist will fall again into the limited material world to become
entangled once more in the wheel of births and deaths, drawn on by the inextinguishable desire for
sensual engagement. But any devotee who enters the kingdom of God by transcendental engagement of
his senses in devotional service, and who associates with the liberated souls and the Personality of
Godhead there, will never be attracted to the limited surroundings of the material world.
In the Bhagavad-gita (8.15) also the same is confirmed, as the Lord says, "The great mahatmas, or the
bhakti-yogis, after attaining My association, never come back to this material world, which is full of
miseries and is nonpermanent." The highest perfection of life, therefore, is to attain His association, and
nothing else. The bhakti-yogi, being completely engaged in the Lord's service, has no attraction for any
other process of liberation like jnana or yoga. A pure devotee is a one hundred percent devotee of the
Lord and nothing more.
We should further note in this verse the two words santam and anandam, which denote that devotional
service of the Lord can really bestow upon the devotee two important benedictions, namely peace and
satisfaction. The impersonalist is desirous of becoming one with the Supreme, or in other words, he wants
to become the Supreme. This is a myth only. The mystic yogis become encumbered by various mystic
powers and so have neither peace nor satisfaction. So neither the impersonalists nor the yogi can have real
peace and satisfaction, but the devotee can become fully peaceful and satisfied because of his association
with the complete whole. Therefore, merging in the Absolute or attaining some mystic powers has no
attraction for the devotee.
Attainment of love of Godhead means complete freedom from all other attractions. The conditioned
soul has many aspirations such as becoming a religious man, a rich man, or a first-class enjoyer or
becoming God himself, or becoming powerful like the mystics and acting wonderfully by getting anything
or doing anything, but all these aspirations should be rejected by the prospective devotee who actually
wants to revive his dormant love of God. The impure devotee aspires after all of the abovementioned
material things by perfection of devotion. But a pure devotee has none of the tinges of the above
contaminations, which are the influence of material desires, impersonal speculations and attainment of
mystic powers. One can attain the stage of love of God by pure devotional service, or by "a learned labor
of love," for the sake of the devotee's lovable object, the Personality of Godhead.
To be more clear, if one wants to attain the stage of love of Godhead, he must give up all desires for
material enjoyment, he should refrain from worshiping any of the demigods, and he should devote
himself only to the worship of the Supreme personality of Godhead. He must give up the foolish idea of
becoming one with the Lord and the desire to have some wonderful powers just to get the ephemeral
adoration of the world. The pure devotee is only favorably engaged in the service of the Lord, without any
hope of emolument. This will bring about love of Godhead, or the stage of santam and anandam, as stated
in this verse.
