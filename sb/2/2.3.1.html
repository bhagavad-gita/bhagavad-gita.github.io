<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Pariksit, as you have inquired from me as to the duty of the
intelligent man who is on the threshold of death, so I have answered you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In human society all over the world there are millions and billions of men and women, and almost all of
them are less intelligent because they have very little knowledge of spirit soul. Almost all of them have a
wrong conception of life, for they identify themselves with the gross and subtle material bodies, which
they are not, in fact. They may be situated in different high and low positions in the estimation of human
society, but one should know definitely that unless one inquires about his own self beyond the body and
the mind, all his activities in human life are total failures. Therefore out of thousands and thousands of
men, one may inquire about his spirit self and thus consult the revealed scriptures like Vedanta-sutras,
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam. But in spite of reading and hearing such scriptures, unless one is
in touch with a realized spiritual master, he cannot actually realize the real nature of self, etc. And out of
thousands and hundreds of thousands of men, someone may know what Lord Krsna is in fact. In the
Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya 20.122-123) it is said that Lord Krsna, out of His causeless mercy, prepared
the Vedic literatures in the incarnation of Vyasadeva for reading by the intelligent class of men in a human
society which is almost totally forgetful of the genuine relation with Krsna. Even such an intelligent class
of men may be forgetful in their relation with the Lord. The whole bhakti-yoga process is therefore a
revival of the lost relation. This revival is possible in the human form of life, which is obtained only out of
the evolutionary cycle of 8,400,000 species of life. The intelligent class of human being must take a
serious note of this opportunity. Not all human beings are intelligent, so the importance of human life is
not always understood. Therefore manisinam, meaning "thoughtful," is particularly used here. A
manisinam person, like Maharaja Pariksit, must therefore take to the lotus feet of Lord Krsna and fully
engage himself in devotional service, hearing, chanting, etc., of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord,
which are all hari-kathamrta. This action is especially recommended when one is preparing for death.
