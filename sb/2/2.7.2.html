<h2>Translation</h2>
The Prajapati first begot Suyajna, in the womb of his wife Akuti, and then Suyajna begot demigods,
headed by Suyama, in the womb of his wife Daksina. Suyajna, as the Indradeva, diminished very great
miseries in the three planetary systems [upper, lower and intermediate], and because he so diminished the
miseries of the universe, he was later called Hari by the great father of mankind, namely Svayambhuva
Manu.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In order to guard against the invention of unauthorized incarnations of God by the fanciful, less
intelligent persons, the name of the father of the bona fide incarnation is also mentioned in the authorized
revealed scriptures. No one, therefore, can be accepted as an incarnation of the Lord if his father's name,
as well as the name of the village or place in which he appears, is not mentioned by the authorized
scriptures. In the Bhagavata Purana the name of the Kalki incarnation, which is to take place in almost
four hundred thousand years, is mentioned along with the name of His father and the name of the village
in which He will appear. A sane man, therefore, does not accept any cheap edition of an incarnation
without reference to the authorized scriptures.
