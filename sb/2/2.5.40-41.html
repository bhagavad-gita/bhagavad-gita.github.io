<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear son Narada, know from me that there are seven lower planetary systems out of the total
fourteen. The first planetary system, known as Atala, is situated on the waist; the second, Vitala, is
situated on the thighs; the third, Sutala, on the knees; the fourth, Talatala, on the shanks; the fifth,
Mahatala, on the ankles; the sixth, Rasatala, on the upper portion of the feet; and the seventh, Patala, on
the soles of the feet. Thus the virat form of the Lord is full of all planetary systems.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Modern enterprisers (the astronauts who travel in space) may take information from Srimad-
Bhagavatam that in space there are fourteen divisions of planetary systems. The situation is calculated
from the earthly planetary system, which is called Bhurloka. Above Bhurloka is Bhuvarloka, and the
topmost planetary system is called Satyaloka. These are the upper seven lokas, or planetary systems. And
similarly, there are seven lower planetary systems, known as Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala,
Rasatala and Patala lokas. All these planetary systems are scattered over the complete universe, which
occupies an area of two billion times two billion square miles. The modern astronauts can travel only a
few thousand miles away from the earth, and therefore their attempt to travel in the sky is something like
child's play on the shore of an expansive ocean. The moon is situated in the third status of the upper
planetary system, and in the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam we shall be able to know the distant
situation of the various planets scattered over the vast material sky. There are innumerable universes
beyond the one in which we are put, and all these material universes cover only an insignificant portion of
the spiritual sky, which is described above as sanatana Brahmaloka. The Supreme Lord very kindly invites
the intelligent human beings to return home, back to Godhead, in the following verse of the Bhagavadgita
(8.16):
a-brahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
Beginning from Satyaloka, the topmost planet of the universe, situated just below the eternal
Brahmaloka, as described above, all the planets are material. And one's situation in any of the many
material planets is still subject to the laws of material nature, namely birth, death, old age and disease. But
one can get complete liberation from all the above-mentioned material pangs when one enters into the
eternal Brahmaloka sanatana atmosphere, the kingdom of God. Therefore liberation, as contemplated by
the speculative philosophers and the mystics, is possible only when one becomes a devotee of the Lord.
Anyone who is not a devotee cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Only by attainment of a service
attitude in the transcendental position can one enter into the kingdom of Godhead. Therefore the
speculative philosophers, as well as the mystics, must first of all be attracted to the devotional cult before
they can factually attain liberation.
