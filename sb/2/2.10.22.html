<h2>Text</h2>
bodhyamanasya rsibhir
atmanas taj jighrksatah
karnau ca nirabhidyetam
disah srotram guna-grahah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bodhyamanasya--desiring to understand; rsibhih--by the authorities; atmanah--of the Supreme Being;
tat--that; jighrksatah--when He desired to take up; karnau--the ears; ca--also; nirabhidyetam--became
manifested; disah--the direction or the god of air; srotram--the power of hearing; guna-grahah--and the
objects of hearing.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By development of the desire of the great sages to know, the ears, the power of hearing, the controlling
deity of hearing, and the objects of hearing became manifested. The great sages desired to hear about the
Self.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, by advancement of knowledge one should try to know about the
Supreme Lord, the summum bonum of everything. Knowledge does not mean knowledge only of the laws
of nature or physical knowledge, which are working by the direction of the Lord. The scientists are eager
to hear about the physical laws working in material nature. They are eager to hear through the medium of
radio and television about things taking place far away from them on other planets, but they should know
that the power of hearing and the instruments for hearing were given to them by the Lord for hearing
about the Self, or about the Lord. Unfortunately the power of hearing is misused in hearing the vibrations
of mundane affairs. The great sages were interested in hearing about the Lord through Vedic knowledge
and nothing more. That is the beginning of aural reception of knowledge.
