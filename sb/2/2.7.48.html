<h2>Text</h2>
sadhryan niyamya yatayo yama-karta-hetim
jahyuh svarad iva nipana-khanitram indrah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sadhryak--artificial mental speculation or meditation; niyamya--controlling; yatayah--the mystics; yamakarta-
hetim--the process of spiritual culture; jahyuh--are given up; svarat--fully independent; iva--as;
nipana--well; khanitram--trouble for digging; indrah--the controlling demigod supplying rains.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In such a transcendental state there is no need of artificial control of the mind, mental speculation or
meditation, as performed by the jnanis and yogis. One gives up such processes, as the heavenly King,
Indra, forgoes the trouble to dig a well.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A poor man in want of water digs a well and undertakes the trouble of digging. Similarly, those who are
poor in transcendental realization speculate on the mind or meditate by controlling the senses. But they
do not know that such control of the senses and achievement of spiritual perfection are simultaneously
made possible as soon as one is factually engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme
Person, the Personality of Godhead. It is for this reason that the great liberated souls also desire to be
associated in hearing and chanting the activities of the Lord. The example of Indra is very appropriate in
this connection. King Indra of heaven is the controlling deity or demigod for arranging clouds and
supplying rains in the universe, and as such he does not have to take the trouble to dig a well for his
personal water supply. For him, digging a well for a water supply is simply ludicrous. Similarly, those
who are factually engaged in the loving service of the Lord have attained the ultimate goal of life, and for
them there is no need of mental speculation to find out the true nature of God or His activities. Nor do
such devotees have to meditate upon the imaginary or real identity of the Lord. Because they are factually
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the Lord's pure devotees have already achieved
the results of mental speculation and meditation. The real perfection of life is therefore to be engaged in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord.
