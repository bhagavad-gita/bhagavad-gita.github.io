<h2>Translation</h2>
If the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whose abdomen the lotus stem sprouted, is possessed of a
gigantic body according to His own caliber and measurement, then what is the specific difference between
the body of the Lord and those of common living entities?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One should note how Maharaja Pariksit intelligently put questions before his spiritual master for
scientific understanding of the transcendental body of the Lord. It has been described in many places
before this that the Lord assumed a gigantic body, like that of Karanodakasayi Visnu, from whose hair
pores innumerable universes have generated. The body of Garbhodakasayi Visnu is described as sprouting
the lotus stem within which all the planets of the universe remain, and at the top of the stem is the lotus
flower on which Lord Brahma is born. In the creation of the material world the Supreme Lord
undoubtedly assumes a gigantic body, and living entities also get bodies, big or small, according to
necessity. For example, an elephant gets a gigantic body according to its needs, and so also an ant gets its
body according to its needs. Similarly, if the Personality of Godhead assumes a gigantic body to
accommodate the universes or the planets of a particular universe, there is no difference in the principle
of assuming or accepting a particular type of body in terms of necessity. A living being and the Lord
cannot be distinguished simply by the difference in the magnitude of the body. So the answer depends on
the specific significance of the body of the Lord, as distinguished from the body of the common living
being.
