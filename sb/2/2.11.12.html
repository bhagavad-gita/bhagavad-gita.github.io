TRANSLATION
One should definitely know that all material ingredients, activities, time and modes, and the living
entities who are meant to enjoy them all, exist by His mercy only, and as soon as He does not care for
them, everything becomes nonexistent.
PURPORT
The living entities are the enjoyers of the material ingredients, time, modes, etc., because they want to
lord it over the material nature. The Lord is the supreme enjoyer, and the living entities are meant to
assist the Lord in His enjoyment and thus participate in the transcendental enjoyment of everyone. The
enjoyer and the enjoyed both participate in enjoyment, but, deluded by the illusory energy, the living
entities want to become the enjoyer like the Lord, although they are not meant for such enjoyment. The
jivas, the living entities, are mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita as the Lord's superior nature, or para prakrti,
and so also it is mentioned in the Visnu Purana. Therefore the living entities are never the purusas, or the
factual enjoyers. As such, the spirit of enjoyment by the living entity in the material world is false. In the
spiritual world the living entities are pure in nature, and therefore they are associates in the enjoyment of
the Supreme Lord. In the material world the spirit of enjoyment of the living entities by dint of their own
actions (karma) gradually fades by the laws of nature, and thus the illusory energy dictates in the ears of
the conditioned souls that they should become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of the illusory
energy. When the last illusion is also cleared off by the mercy of the Lord, the living entity again becomes
reinstated in his original position and thus becomes actually liberated. For this attainment of liberation
from the material clutches, the Lord creates the material world, maintains it for some time (one thousand
years of His measurement, as stated in the previous verse), and then again annihilates it by His will. The
living entities are therefore completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord, and all their so-called
enjoyments by scientific improvement are crushed into dust when the Lord desires.
