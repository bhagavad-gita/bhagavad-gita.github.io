TRANSLATION
Men who are like dogs, hogs, camels and asses praise those men who never listen to the transcendental
pastimes of Lord Sri Krsna, the deliverer from evils.
PURPORT
The general mass of people, unless they are trained systematically for a higher standard of life in
spiritual values, are no better than animals, and in this verse they have particularly been put on the level
of dogs, hogs, camels and asses. Modern university education practically prepares one to acquire a
doggish mentality with which to accept the service of a greater master. After finishing a so-called
education, the so-called educated persons move like dogs from door to door with applications for some
service, and mostly they are driven away, informed of no vacancy. As dogs are negligible animals and
serve the master faithfully for bits of bread, a man serves a master faithfully without sufficient rewards.
Persons who have no discrimination in the matter of foodstuff and who eat all sorts of rubbish are
compared to hogs. Hogs are very much attached to eating stools. So stool is a kind of foodstuff for a
particular type of animal. And even stones are eatables for a particular type of animal or bird. But the
human being is not meant for eating everything and anything; he is meant to eat grains, vegetables, fruits,
milk, sugar, etc. Animal food is not meant for the human being. For chewing solid food, the human being
has a particular type of teeth meant for cutting fruits and vegetables. The human being is endowed with
two canine teeth as a concession for persons who will eat animal food at any cost. It is known to everyone
that one man's food is another man's poison. Human beings are expected to accept the remnants of food
offered to Lord Sri Krsna, and the Lord accepts foodstuff from the categories of leaves, flowers, fruits, etc.
(Bg. 9.26). As prescribed by Vedic scriptures, no animal food is offered to the Lord. Therefore, a human
being is meant to eat a particular type of food. He should not imitate the animals to derive so-called
vitamin values. Therefore, a person who has no discrimination in regard to eating is compared to a hog.
The camel is a kind of animal that takes pleasure in eating thorns. A person who wants to enjoy family
life or the worldly life of so-called enjoyment is compared to the camel. Materialistic life is full of thorns,
and so one should live only by the prescribed method of Vedic regulations just to make the best use of a
bad bargain. Life in the material world is maintained by sucking one's own blood. The central point of
attraction for material enjoyment is sex life. To enjoy sex life is to suck one's own blood, and there is not
much more to be explained in this connection. The camel also sucks its own blood while chewing thorny
twigs. The thorns the camel eats cut the tongue of the camel, and so blood begins to flow within the
camel's mouth. The thorns, mixed with fresh blood, create a taste for the foolish camel, and so he enjoys
the thorn-eating business with false pleasure. Similarly, the great business magnates, industrialists who
work very hard to earn money by different ways and questionable means, eat the thorny results of their
actions mixed with their own blood. Therefore the Bhagavatam has situated these diseased fellows along
with the camels.
The ass is an animal who is celebrated as the greatest fool, even amongst the animals. The ass works
very hard and carries burdens of the maximum weight without making profit for itself.). One' s selfishness
must be aimed at the point of going back to Godhead. The ass does not know his self-interest, and it
works very hard for others only. A person who works very hard for others only, forgetting his personal
interest available in the human form of life, is compared to the ass. In the Brahma-vaivarta Purana it is
said:
asitim caturas caiva
laksams tan jiva-jatisu
bhramadbhih purusaih prapyam
manusyam janma-paryayat
tad apy abhalatam jatah
tesam atmabhimaninam
varakanam anasritya
govinda-carana-dvayam
The human life is so important that even the demigods in the higher planets sometimes aspire for a
human body on this earth because in the human body only can one easily go back to Godhead. In spite of
having obtained such an important body, if one does not re-establish his lost eternal relation with
Govinda, Lord Krsna, he is certainly a fool who has forgotten his self-interest. This human form of
material body is obtained by a gradual process of evolution to one body after another in the cycle of
8,400,000 varieties of life. And the poor man, forgetting this importance for his own interest, involves
himself in so many illusory engagements for uplifting the position of others as a leader of political
emancipation and economic development. There is no harm in trying for political emancipation or
economic development, but one should not forget the real aim of life: all such philanthropic activities
must be dovetailed to returning to Godhead. One who does not know this is compared to the ass who
works only for others, without their of his own welfare in mind.
The ass is generally engaged by the washerman, whose social position is not very respectable. And the
special qualification of the ass is that it is very much accustomed to being kicked by the opposite sex.
When the ass begs for sexual intercourse, he is kicked by the fair sex, yet he still follows the female for
such sexual pleasure. A henpecked man is compared, therefore, to the ass. The general mass of people
work very hard, especially in the age of Kali. In this age the human being is actually engaged in the work
of an ass, carrying heavy burdens and driving thela and rickshaws. The so-called advancement of human
civilization has engaged a human being in the work of an ass. The laborers in great factories and
workshops are also engaged in such burdensome work, and after working hard during the day, the poor
laborer has to be again kicked by the fair sex, not only for sex enjoyment but also for so many household
affairs.
So Srimad-Bhagavatam's categorization of the common man without any spiritual enlightenment into
the society of dogs, hogs, camels and asses is not at all an exaggeration. The leaders of such ignorant
masses of people may feel very proud of being adored by such a number of dogs and hogs, but that is not
very flattering. The Bhagavatam openly declares that although a person may be a great leader of such dogs
and hogs disguised as men, if he has no taste for being enlightened in the science of Krsna, such a leader
is also an animal and nothing more. He may be designated as a powerful, strong animal, or a big animal,
but in the estimation of Srimad-Bhagavatam he is never given a place in the category of man, on account
of his atheistic temperament. Or, in other words, such godless leaders of dogs and hoglike men are bigger
animals with the qualities of animals in greater proportion.
