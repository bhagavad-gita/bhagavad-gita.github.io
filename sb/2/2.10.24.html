<h2>Text</h2>
hastau ruruhatus tasya
nana-karma-cikirsaya
tayos tu balavan indra
adanam ubhayasrayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hastau--the hands; ruruhatuh--manifested; tasya--His; nana--various; karma--work; cikirsaya--being so
desirous; tayoh--of them; tu--however; balavan--to give strength; indrah--the demigod in heaven;
adanam--activities of the hand; ubhaya-asrayam--dependent on both the demigod and the hand.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter when the Supreme Person desired to perform varieties of work, the two hands and their
controlling strength, and Indra, the demigod in heaven, became manifested, as also the acts dependent on
both the hands and the demigod.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In every item we can note with profit that the sense organs of the living entity are never independent at
any stage. The Lord is known as the Lord of the senses (Hrsikesa). Thus the sense organs of the living
entities are manifested by the will of the Lord, and each organ is controlled by a certain type of demigod.
No one, therefore, can claim any proprietorship of the senses. The living entity is controlled by the senses,
the senses are controlled by the demigods, and the demigods are the servants of the Supreme Lord. That is
the arrangement in the system of creation. The whole thing is controlled ultimately by the Supreme Lord,
and there is no independence either of the material nature or of the living entity. The illusioned living
entity who claims to be the lord of his senses is under the clutches of the external energy of the Lord. As
long as a living entity continues to be puffed up by his tiny existence, he is to be understood to be under
the stringent control of the external energy of the Lord, and there is no question of liberation from the
clutches of illusion (maya), however much one may declare himself a liberated soul.
