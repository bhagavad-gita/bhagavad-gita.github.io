<h2>Translation</h2>
Maharaja Vena went astray from the path of righteousness, and the brahmanas chastised him by the
thunderbolt curse. By this King Vena was burnt with his good deeds and opulence and was en route to
hell. The Lord, by His causeless mercy, descended as his son, by the name of Prthu, delivered the
condemned King Vena from hell, and exploited the earth by drawing all kinds of crops as produce.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the system of varnasrama-dharma, the pious and learned brahmanas were the natural
guardians of society. The brahmanas, by their learned labor of love, would instruct the administratorkings
how to rule the country in complete righteousness, and thus the process would go on as a perfect
welfare state. The kings or the ksatriya administrators would always consult the council of learned
brahmanas. They were never autocratic monarchs. The scriptures like Manu-samhita and other authorized
books of the great sages were guiding principles for ruling the subjects, and there was no need for less
intelligent persons to manufacture a code of law in the name of democracy. The less intelligent mass of
people have very little knowledge of their own welfare, as a child has very little knowledge of its future
well-being. The experienced father guides the innocent child towards the path of progress, and the
childlike mass of people need similar guidance. The standard welfare codes are already there in the Manusamhita
and other Vedic literatures. The learned brahmanas would advise the king in terms of those
standard books of knowledge and with reference to the particular situation of time and place. Such
brahmanas were not paid servants of the king, and therefore they had the strength to dictate to the king
on the principles of scriptures. This system continued even up to the time of Maharaja Candragupta, and
the brahmana Canakya was his unpaid prime minister.
Maharaja Vena did not adhere to this principle of ruling, and he disobeyed the learned brahmanas. The
broad-minded brahmanas were not self-interested, but looked to the interest of complete welfare for all
the subjects. They wanted to chastise King Vena for his misconduct and so prayed to the Almighty Lord as
well as cursed the king.
Long life, obedience, good reputation, righteousness, prospects of being promoted to higher planets,
and blessings of great personalities are all vanquished simply by disobedience to a great soul. One should
strictly try to follow in the footsteps of great souls. Maharaja Vena became a king, undoubtedly due to his
past deeds of righteousness, but because he willfully neglected the great souls, he was punished by the
loss of all the above-mentioned acquisitions. In the Vamana purana the history of Maharaja Vena and his
degradation are fully described. When Maharaja Prthu heard about the hellish condition of his father,
Vena, who was suffering from leprosy in the family of a mleccha, he at once brought the former king to
Kuruksetra for his purification and relieved him of all sufferings.
Maharaja Prthu, the incarnation of God, descended by the prayer of the brahmanas to rectify the
disorders on earth. He produced all kinds of crops. But, at the same time, he performed the duty of a son
who delivers his father from hellish conditions. The word putra means one who delivers from hell, called
put. That is a worthy son.
