O learned brahmana, the transcendental spirit soul is different from the material body. Does he acquire
the body accidentally or by some cause? Will you kindly explain this, for it is known to you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Pariksit, being a typical devotee, is not only satisfied by confirming the importance of hearing
the Srimad-Bhagavatam from the representative of Brahmaji by disciplic succession, but he is still more
anxious to establish the philosophical basis of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the science of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such all questions that may arise in the mind of a serious
student must be cleared by the statements of the authority. A person on the path of devotional service
may inquire from his spiritual master all about the spiritual position of God and the living beings. From
the Bhagavad-gita, as well as from the Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is known that qualitatively the Lord and the
living beings are one. The living being in the conditioned state of material existence is subjected to many
transmigrations by continuous changing of the material body. But what are the causes of the material
embodiment of the part and parcel of the Lord? Maharaja Pariksit inquires about this very important
matter for the benefit of all classes of candidates on the path of self-realization and devotional service to
the Lord.
Indirectly it is confirmed that the Supreme Being, the Lord, makes no such material changes of body. He
is spiritually whole, with no difference between His body and His soul, unlike the conditioned soul. The
liberated living beings, who associate with the Lord in person, are also exactly like the Lord. Only the
conditioned souls awaiting liberation are subjected to change of bodies. How was the process first begun?
In the process of devotional service, the first step is to take shelter of the spiritual master and then
inquire from the spiritual master all about the process. This inquiry is essential for immunity to all kinds
of offenses on the path of devotional service. Even if one is fixed in devotional service like Maharaja
Pariksit, he must still inquire from the realized spiritual master all about this. In other words, the spiritual
master must also be well versed and learned so that he may be able to answer all these inquiries from the
devotees. Thus one who is not well versed in the authorized scriptures and not able to answer all such
relevant inquiries should not pose as a spiritual master for the matter of material gain. It is illegal to
become a spiritual master if one is unable to deliver the disciple.
