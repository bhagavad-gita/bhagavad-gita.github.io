TRANSLATION
Great stalwarts like Lord Siva can, by their wrathful glances, overcome lust and vanquish him, yet they
cannot be free from the overwhelming effects of their own wrath. Such wrath can never enter into the
heart of Him [the Lord], who is above all this. So how can lust take shelter in His mind?
PURPORT
When Lord Siva was engaged in severely austere meditation, Cupid, the demigod of lust, threw his
arrow of sex desire. Lord Siva, thus being angry at him, glanced at Cupid in great wrath, and at once the
body of Cupid was annihilated. Although Lord Siva was so powerful, he was unable to get free from the
effects of such wrath. But in the behavior of Lord Visnu there is no incident of such wrath at any time. On
the contrary, Bhrgu Muni tested the tolerance of the Lord by purposely kicking His chest, but instead of
being angry at Bhrgu Muni the Lord begged his pardon, saying that Bhrgu Muni's leg might have been
badly hurt because His chest is too hard. The Lord has the sign of the foot of bhrgupada as the mark of
tolerance. The Lord, therefore, is never affected by any kind of wrath, so how can there be any place for
lust, which is less strong than wrath? When lust or desire is not fulfilled, there is the appearance of wrath,
but in the absence of wrath how can there be any place for lust? The Lord is known as apta-kama, or one
who can fulfill His desires by Himself. He does not require anyone's help to satisfy His desires. The Lord is
unlimited, and therefore His desires are also unlimited. All living entities but the Lord are limited in every
respect; how then can the limited satisfy the desires of the unlimited? The conclusion is that the Absolute
Personality of Godhead has neither lust nor anger, and even if there is sometimes a show of lust and anger
by the Absolute, it should be considered an absolute benediction.
