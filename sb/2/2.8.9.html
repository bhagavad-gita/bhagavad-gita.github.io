<h2>Text</h2>
ajah srjati bhutani
bhutatma yad-anugrahat
dadrse yena tad-rupam
nabhi-padma-samudbhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ajah--one who is born without a material source; srjati--creates; bhutani--all those materially born;
bhuta-atma--having a body of matter; yat--whose; anugrahat--by the mercy of; dadrse--could see; yena--by
whom; tat-rupam--His form of body; nabhi--navel; padma--lotus flower; samudbhavah--being born of.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Brahma, who was not born of a material source but of the lotus flower coming out of the navel abdomen
of the Lord, is the creator of all those who are materially born. Of course, by the grace of the Lord,
Brahma was able to see the form of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The first living creature, Brahma, is called ajah because he did not take his birth from the womb of a
mother materially born. He was directly born from the bodily expansion of the lotus flower of the Lord.
Thus it is not readily understandable whether the body of the Lord and that of Brahma are of the same
quality or different. This must also be clearly understood. One thing is, however, certain: Brahma was
completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord because after his birth he could create living beings by the
Lord's grace only, and he could see the form of the Lord. Whether the form seen by Brahma is of the same
quality as that of Brahma is a bewildering question, and Maharaja Pariksit wanted to get clear answers
from Srila Sukadeva Gosvami.
