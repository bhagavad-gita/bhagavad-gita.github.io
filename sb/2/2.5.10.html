<h2>Text</h2>
nanrtam tava tac capi
yatha mam prabravisi bhoh
avijnaya param matta
etavat tvam yato hi me
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; anrtam--false; tava--of yours; tat--that; ca--also; api--as you have stated; yatha--in the matter of;
mam--of myself; prabravisi--as you describe; bhoh--O my son; avijnaya--without knowing; param--the
Supreme; mattah--beyond myself; etavat--all that you have spoken; tvam--yourself; yatah--for the reason
of; hi--certainly; me--about me.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Whatever you have spoken about me is not false because unless and until one is aware of the Personality
of Godhead, who is the ultimate truth beyond me, one is sure to be illusioned by observing my powerful
activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
"The frog in the well" logic illustrates that a frog residing in the atmosphere and boundary of a well
cannot imagine the length and breadth of the gigantic ocean. Such a frog, when informed of the gigantic
length and breadth of the ocean, first of all does not believe that there is such an ocean, and if someone
assures him that factually there is such a thing, the frog then begins to measure it by imagination by
means of pumping its belly as far as possible, with the result that the tiny abdomen of the frog bursts and
the poor frog dies without any experience of the actual ocean. Similarly, the material scientists also want
to challenge the inconceivable potency of the Lord by measuring Him with their froglike brains and their
scientific achievements, but at the end they simply die unsuccessfully, like the frog.
Sometimes a materially powerful man is accepted as God or the incarnation of God without any
knowledge of the factual God. Such a material assessment may be gradually extended, and the attempt
may reach to the highest limit of Brahmaji, who is the topmost living being within the universe and has a
duration of life unimaginable to the material scientist. As we get information from the most authentic
book of knowledge, the Bhagavad-gita (8.17), Brahmaji's one day and night is calculated to be some
hundreds of thousands of years on our planet. This long duration of life may not be believed by "the frog
in the well," but persons who have a realization of the truths mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita accept the
existence of a great personality who creates the variegatedness of the complete universe. It is understood
from the revealed scriptures that the Brahmaji of this universe is younger than all the other Brahmas in
charge of the many, many universes beyond this, but none of them can be equal to the Personality of
Godhead.
Naradaji is one of the liberated souls, and after his liberation he was known as Narada; otherwise, before
his liberation, he was simply a son of a maidservant. The questions may be asked why Naradaji was not
aware of the Supreme Lord and why he mis-conceived Brahmaji to be the Supreme Lord, although
factually he was not. A liberated soul is never bewildered by such a mistaken idea, so why did Naradaji
ask all those questions just like an ordinary man with a poor fund of knowledge? There was such
bewilderment in Arjuna also, although he is eternally the associate of the Lord. Such bewilderment in
Arjuna or in Narada takes place by the will of the Lord so that other, nonliberated persons may realize the
real truth and knowledge of the Lord. The doubt arising in the mind of Narada about Brahmaji's becoming
all-powerful is a lesson for the frogs in the well, that they may not be bewildered in misconceiving the
identity of the Personality of Godhead (even by comparison to a personality like Brahma, so what to speak
of ordinary men who falsely pose themselves as God or an incarnation of God). The Supreme Lord is
always the Supreme, and as we have tried to establish many times in these purports, no living being, even
up to the standard of Brahma, can claim to be one with the Lord. One should not be misled when people
worship a great man as God after his death as a matter of hero worship. There were many kings like Lord
Ramacandra, the King of Ayodhya, but none of them are mentioned as God in the revealed scriptures. To
be a good king is not necessarily the qualification for being Lord Rama, but to be a great personality like
Krsna is the qualification for being the Personality of Godhead. If we scrutinize the characters who took
part in the Battle of Kuruksetra, we may find that Maharaja Yudhisthira was no less a pious king than
Lord Ramacandra, and by character study Maharaja Yudhisthira was a better moralist than Lord Krsna.
Lord Krsna asked Maharaja Yudhisthira to lie, but Maharaja Yudhisthira protested. But that does not
mean that Maharaja Yudhisthira could be equal to Lord Ramacandra or Lord Krsna. The great authorities
have estimated Maharaja Yudhisthira to be a pious man, but they have accepted Lord Rama or Krsna as
the Personality of Godhead. The Lord is therefore a different identity in all circumstances, and no idea of
anthropomorphism can be applied to Him. The Lord is always the Lord, and a common living being can
never be equal to Him.
