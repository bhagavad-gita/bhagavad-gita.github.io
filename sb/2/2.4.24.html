TRANSLATION
Certainly that heart is steel-framed which, in spite of one's chanting the holy name of the Lord with
concentration, does not change when ecstasy takes place, tears fill the eyes and the hairs stand on end.
PURPORT
We should note with profit that in the first three chapters of the Second Canto a gradual process of
development of devotional service is being presented. In the First Chapter the first step in devotional
service for God consciousness by the process of hearing and chanting has been stressed, and a gross
conception of the Personality of Godhead in His universal form for the beginners is recommended. By
such a gross conception of God through the material manifestations of His energy, one is enabled to
spiritualize the mind and the senses and gradually concentrate the mind upon Lord Visnu, the Supreme,
who is present as the Supersoul in every heart and everywhere, in every atom of the material universe.
The system of panca-upasana, recommending five mental attitudes for the common man, is also enacted
for this purpose, namely gradual development, worship of the superior that may be in the form of fire,
electricity, the sun, the mass of living beings, Lord Siva and, at last, the impersonal Supersoul, the partial
representation of Lord Visnu. They are all nicely described in the Second Chapter, but in the Third
Chapter further development is prescribed after one has actually reached the stage of Visnu worship, or
pure devotional service, and the mature stage of Visnu worship is suggested herein in relation to the
change of heart.
The whole process of spiritual culture is aimed at changing the heart of the living being in the matter of
his eternal relation with the Supreme Lord as subordinate servant, which is his eternal constitutional
position. So with the progress of devotional service, the reaction of change in the heart is exhibited by
gradual detachment from the sense of material enjoyment by a false sense of lording it over the world and
an increase in the attitude of rendering loving service to the Lord. Vidhi-bhakti, or regulated devotional
service by the limbs of the body (namely the eyes, the ears, the nose, the hands and the legs, as already
explained hereinbefore), is now stressed herein in relation to the mind, which is the impetus for all
activities of the limbs of the body. It is expected by all means that by discharging regulated devotional
service one must manifest the change of heart. If there is no such change, the heart must be considered
steel-framed, for it is not melted even when there is chanting of the holy name of the Lord. We must
always remember that hearing and chanting are the basic principles of discharging devotional duties, and
if they are properly performed there will follow the reactional ecstasy with signs of tears in the eyes and
standing of the hairs on the body. These are natural consequences and are the preliminary symptoms of
the bhava stage, which occurs before one reaches the perfectional stage of prema, love of Godhead.
If the reaction does not take place, even after continuous hearing and chanting of the holy name of the
Lord, it may be considered to be due to offenses only. That is the opinion of the Sandarbha. In the
beginning of chanting of the holy name of the Lord, if the devotee has not been very careful about evading
the ten kinds of offenses at the feet of the holy name, certainly the reaction of feelings of separation will
not be visible by tears in the eyes and standing of the hair on end.
The bhava stage is manifested by eight transcendental symptoms, namely inertness, perspiration,
standing of hairs on end, failing in the voice, trembling, paleness of the body, tears in the eyes and finally
trance. The Nectar of Devotion, a summary study of Srila Rupa Gosvami's Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu,
explains those symptoms and vividly describes other transcendental developments, both in steady and
accelerating manifestations.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has very critically discussed all these bhava displays in connection
with some unscrupulous neophyte's imitating the above symptoms for cheap appreciation. Not only
Visvanatha Cakravarti but also Srila Rupa Gosvami treated them very critically. Sometimes all the above
eight symptoms of ecstasy are imitated by the mundane devotees (prakrta-sahajiyas), but the pseudo
symptoms are at once detected when one sees the pseudodevotee addicted to so many forbidden things.
Even though decorated with the signs of a devotee, a person addicted to smoking, drinking or illegitimate
sex with women cannot have all the above-mentioned ecstatic symptoms. But it is seen that sometimes
these symptoms are willfully imitated, and for this reason Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti accuses the
imitators of being stonehearted men. They are sometimes even affected by the reflection of such
transcendental symptoms, yet if they still do not give up the forbidden habits, then they are hopeless cases
for transcendental realization.
When Lord Caitanya met Srila Ramananda Raya of Kavaur on the bank of the Godavari, the Lord
developed all these symptoms, but because of the presence of some nondevotee brahmanas who were
attendants of the Raya, the Lord suppressed these symptoms. So sometimes they are not visible even in
the body of the first-class devotee for certain circumstantial reasons. Therefore real, steady bhava is
definitely displayed in the matter of cessation of material desires (ksanti), utilization of every moment in
the transcendental loving service of the Lord (avyartha-kalatvam), eagerness for glorifying the Lord
constantly (nama-gane sada ruci), attraction for living in the land of the Lord (pritis tad-vasati sthale),
complete detachment from material happiness (virakti), and pridelessness (mana-sunyata). One who has
developed all these transcendental qualities is really possessed of the bhava stage, as distinguished from
the stonehearted imitator or mundane devotee.
The whole process can be summarized as follows: The advanced devotee who chants the holy name of
the Lord in a perfectly offenseless manner and is friendly to everyone can actually relish the
transcendental taste of glorifying the Lord. And the result of such realization is reflected in the cessation
of all material desires, etc., as mentioned above. The neophytes, due to their being in the lower stage of
devotional service, are invariably envious, so much so that they invent their own ways and means of
devotional regulations without following the acaryas. As such, even if they make a show of constantly
chanting the holy name of the Lord, they cannot relish the transcendental taste of the holy name.
Therefore, the show of tears in the eyes, trembling, perspiration or unconsciousness, etc., is condemned.
They can, however, get in touch with a pure devotee of the Lord and rectify their bad habits; otherwise
they shall continue to be stonehearted and unfit for any treatment. A complete progressive march on the
return path home, back to Godhead, will depend on the instructions of the revealed scriptures directed by
a realized devotee.
