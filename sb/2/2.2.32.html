<h2>Translation</h2>
Your Majesty Maharaja Pariksit, know that all that I have described in reply to your proper inquiry is
just according to the version of the Vedas, and it is eternal truth. This was described personally by Lord
Krsna unto Brahma, with whom the Lord was satisfied upon being properly worshiped.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The two different ways of reaching the spiritual sky and thereby getting emancipation from all material
bondage, namely either the direct process of reaching the kingdom of God or the gradual process through
the other higher planets of the universe, are set forth exactly according to the version of the Vedas. The
Vedic versions in this connection are, yada sarve pramucyante kama ye 'sya hrdi sritah. atha martyo 'mrto
bhavaty atra brahma samasnute (Brhad-aranyaka Upanisad 4.4.7) and te 'rcir abhisambhavanti (Brhadaranyaka
Upanisad 6.2.15): "Those who are free from all material desires, which are diseases of the heart,
are able to conquer death and enter the kingdom of God through the Arci planets." These Vedic versions
corroborate the version of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, and the latter is further confirmed by Sukadeva
Gosvami, who affirms that the truth was disclosed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna,
Vasudeva, to Brahma, the first authority on the Vedas. The disciplic succession holds that the Vedas were
uttered by Lord Krsna to Brahma, by Brahma to Narada, and by Narada to Vyasadeva, and then by
Vyasadeva to Sukadeva Gosvami and so on. So there is no difference between the versions of all the
authorities. The truth is eternal, and as such there cannot be any new opinion about the truth. That is the
way of knowing the knowledge contained in the Vedas. It is not a thing to be understood by one's erudite
scholarship or by the fashionable interpretations of mundane scholars. There is nothing to be added and
nothing to be subtracted, because the truth is the truth. One has to accept, after all, some authority. The
modern scientists are also authorities for the common man for some scientific truths. The common man
follows the version of the scientist. This means that the common man follows the authority. The Vedic
knowledge is also received in that way. The common man cannot argue about what is beyond the sky or
beyond the universe; he must accept the versions of the Vedas as they are understood by the authorized
disciplic succession. In the Bhagavad-gita also the same process of understanding the Gita is stated in the
Fourth Chapter. If one does not follow the authoritative version of the acaryas, he will vainly search after
the truth mentioned in the Vedas.
