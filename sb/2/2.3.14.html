<h2>Translation</h2>
O learned Suta Gosvami! Please continue to explain such topics to us because we are all eager to hear.
Besides that, topics which result in the discussion of the Lord Hari should certainly be discussed in the
assembly of devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As we have already quoted above from the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of Rupa Gosvami, even mundane
things, if dovetailed in the service of the Lord Sri Krsna, are accepted as transcendental. For example, the
epics or the histories of Ramayana and Mahabharata, which are specifically recommended for the less
intelligent classes (women, sudras and unworthy sons of the higher castes), are also accepted as Vedic
literature because they are compiled in connection with the activities of the Lord. Mahabharata is
accepted as the fifth division of the Vedas after its first four divisions, namely Sama, Yajur, Rg and
Atharva. The less intelligent do not accept Mahabharata as part of the Vedas, but great sages and
authorities accept it as the fifth division of the Vedas. Bhagavad-gita is also part of the Mahabharata, and it
is full of the Lord's instruction for the less intelligent class of men. Some less intelligent men say that
Bhagavad-gita is not meant for householders, but such foolish men forget that Bhagavad-gita was
explained to Arjuna, a grhastha (family man), and spoken by the Lord in His role as a grhastha. So
Bhagavad-gita, although containing the high philosophy of the Vedic wisdom, is for the beginners in the
transcendental science, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is for graduates and postgraduates in the transcendental
science. Therefore literatures like Mahabharata, the, puranas and similar other literatures which are full of
the pastimes of the Lord, are all transcendental literatures, and they should be discussed with full
confidence in the society of great devotees.
The difficulty is that such literatures, when discussed by professional men, appear to be mundane
literature like histories or epics because there are so many historical facts and figures. It is said here,
therefore, that such literatures should be discussed in the assembly of devotees. Unless they are discussed
by devotees, such literatures cannot be relished by the higher class of men. So the conclusion is that the
Lord is not impersonal in the ultimate issue. He is the Supreme Person, and He has His different activities.
He is the leader of all living entities, and He descends at His will and by His personal energy to reclaim the
fallen souls. Thus He plays exactly like the social, political or religious leaders. Because such roles
ultimately culminate in the discussion of topics of the Lord, all such preliminary topics are also
transcendental. That is the way of spiritualizing the civic activities of human society. Men have
inclinations for studying history and many other mundane literatures--stories, fiction, dramas, magazines,
newspapers, etc.--so let them be dovetailed with the transcendental service of the Lord, and all of them
will turn to the topics relished by all devotees. The propaganda that the Lord is impersonal, that He has
no activity and that He is a dumb stone without any name and form has encouraged people to become
godless, faithless demons, and the more they deviate from the transcendental activities of the Lord, the
more they become accustomed to mundane activities that only clear their path to hell instead of return
them home, back to Godhead.
Srimad-Bhagavatam begins from the history of the Pandavas (with necessary politics and social
activities), and yet Srimad-Bhagavatam is said to be the Paramahamsa-samhita, or the Vedic literature
meant for the topmost transcendentalist, and it describes param jnanam, the highest transcendental
knowledge. pure devotees of the Lord are all paramahamsas, and they are like the swans, who know the
art of sucking milk out of a mixture of milk and water.
