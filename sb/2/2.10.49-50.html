Saunaka Rsi said: Let us know, please, what topics were discussed between Vidura and Maitreya, who
talked on transcendental subjects, and what was inquired by Vidura and replied by Maitreya. Also please
let us know the reason for Vidura's giving up the connection of his family members, and why he again
came home. Please also let us know the activities of Vidura while he was in the places of pilgrimage.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sri Suta Gosvami was narrating the topics of the creation and destruction of the material world, but it
appears that the rsis headed by Saunaka were more inclined to hear of transcendental subjects, which are
on a higher level than the physical. There are two classes of men, namely those too addicted to the gross
body and the material world, and others, on the higher level, who are interested more in transcendental
knowledge. Srimad-Bhagavatam gives facility to everyone, both to the materialist and to the
transcendentalist. By hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam in the matter of the Lord's glorious activities both in the
material world and in the transcendental world, men can derive equal benefit. The materialists are more
interested in the physical laws and how they are acting, and they see wonders in those physical glamors.
Sometimes, due to physical glamors, they forget the glories of the Lord. They should know definitely that
physical activities and their wonders are all initiated by the Lord. The rose in the garden gradually takes
its shape and color to become beautiful and sweet not by a blind physical law, although it appears like
that. Behind that physical law is the direction of the complete consciousness of the Supreme Lord,
otherwise things cannot take shape so systematically. The artist draws a picture of a rose very nicely with
all attention and artistic sense, and yet it does not become as perfect as the real rose. If that is the real fact,
how can we say that the real rose has taken its shape without intelligence behind the beauty? This sort of
conclusion is due to a poor fund of knowledge. One must know from the above description of creation
and annihilation that the supreme consciousness, being omnipresent, can take care of everything with
perfect attention. That is the fact of the omnipresence of the Supreme Lord. Persons, still more foolish
than the gross materialists, however, claim to be transcendentalists and claim to have such supreme allpervading
consciousness, but offer no proof. Such foolish persons cannot know what is going on behind
the next wall, yet they are falsely proud of possessing the cosmic, all-pervading consciousness of the
Supreme Person. For them also, hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam is a great help. It will open their eyes to
see that simply by claiming supreme consciousness one does not become supremely conscious. One has to
prove in the physical world that he has such supreme consciousness. The rsis of Naimisaranya, however,
were above the gross materialists and the false transcendentalists, and thus they were always anxious to
know the real truth in transcendental matters, as discussed by authorities.
