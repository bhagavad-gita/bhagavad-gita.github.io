tasyapi drastur isasya
kuta-sthasyakhilatmanah
srjyam srjami srsto 'ham

SYNONYMS
tasya--His; api--certainly; drastuh--of the seer; isasya--of the controller; kuta-sthasya--of the one who is
over everyone's intelligence; akhila-atmanah--of the Supersoul; srjyam--that which is already created;
srjami--do I discover; srstah--created; aham--myself; iksaya--by glance over; eva--exactly; abhicoditah--
being inspired by Him.
TRANSLATION
Inspired by Him only, I discover what is already created by Him [Narayana] under His vision as the allpervading
Supersoul, and I also am created by Him only.
PURPORT
Even Brahma, the creator of the universe, admits that he is not the actual creator but is simply inspired
by the Lord Narayana and therefore creates under His superintendence those things already created by
Him, the Supersoul of all living entities. Two identities of soul, the Supersoul and the individual soul, are
admitted to be in the living entity, even by the greatest authority of the universe. The Supersoul is the
Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, whereas the individual soul is the eternal servitor of the Lord.
The Lord inspires the individual soul to create what is already created by the Lord, and by the good will of
the Lord a discoverer of something in the world is accredited as the discoverer. It is said that Columbus
discovered the Western Hemisphere, but actually the tract of land was not created by Columbus. The vast
tract of land was already there by the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord, and Columbus, by dint of his
past service unto the Lord, was blessed with the credit of discovering America. Similarly, no one can
create anything without the sanction of the Lord, since everyone sees according to his ability. This ability
is also awarded by the Lord according to one's willingness to render service unto the Lord. One must
therefore be voluntarily willing to render service unto the Lord, and thus the Lord will empower the doer
in proportion to his surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Brahma is a great devotee of the Lord;
therefore he has been empowered or inspired by the Lord to create such a universe as the one manifested
before us. The Lord also inspired Arjuna to fight in the field of Kuruksetra as follows:
tasmat tvam uttistha yaso labhasva
jitva satrun bhunksva rajyam samrddham
mayaivaite nihatah purvam eva
nimitta-matram bhava savyasacin
(Bg. 11.33)
The Battle of Kuruksetra, or any other battle at any place or at any time, is made by the will of the Lord,
for no one can arrange such mass annihilation without the sanction of the Lord. The party of Duryodhana
insulted Draupadi, a great devotee of Krsna, and she appealed to the Lord as well as to all the silent
observers of this unwarranted insult. Arjuna was then advised by the Lord to fight and take credit;
otherwise the party of Duryodhana would be killed anyway by the will of the Lord. So Arjuna was advised
just to become the agent and take the credit for killing great generals like Bhisma and Karna.
In the Vedic writings such as the Katha Upanisad, the Lord is described as the sarva-bhuta-antaratma, or
the Personality of Godhead who resides in everyone's body and who directs everything for one who is a
soul surrendered unto Him. Those who are not surrendered souls are put under the care of the material
nature (bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani mayaya); therefore, they are allowed to do things on
their own account and suffer the consequences themselves. Devotees like Brahma and Arjuna do not do
anything on their own account, but as fully surrendered souls they always await indications from the
Lord; therefore they attempt to do something which appears very wonderful to ordinary vision. One of the
Lord's names is Urukrama, or one whose actions are very wonderful and are beyond the imagination of
the living being, so the actions of His devotees sometimes appear very wonderful due to the direction of
the Lord. Beginning from Brahma, the topmost intelligent living entity within the universe, down to the
smallest ant, every living entity's intelligence is overseen by the Lord in His transcendental position as the
witness of all actions. The subtle presence of the Lord is felt by the intelligent man who can study the
psychic effects of thinking, feeling and willing.
