pratapati--illuminated; asau--the sun; evam--in the same way; virajam--the universal form; pratapan--by
expansion of; tapati--enlivens; antah--internally; bahih--externally; puman--the Supreme Personality.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sun illuminates both internally and externally by expanding its radiation; similarly, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, by expanding His universal form, maintains everything in the creation both
internally and externally.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The universal form of the Lord, or the impersonal feature of the Lord known as the brahmajyoti, is
clearly explained here and compared to the radiation of the sun. The sunshine may expand all over the
universe, but the source of the sunshine, namely the sun planet or the deity known as Surya-narayana, is
the basis of such radiation. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna is the basis of the
impersonal brahmajyoti radiation, or the impersonal feature of the Lord. This is confirmed in the
Bhagavad-gita (14.27). So the universal form of the Lord is the secondary imagination of the impersonal
form of the Lord, but the primary form of the Lord is Syamasundara, with two hands, playing on His
eternal flute. Seventy-five percent of the expansive radiation of the Lord is manifested in the spiritual sky
(tripad-vibhuti), and twenty-five percent of His personal radiation comprehends the entire expansion of
the material universes. This is also explained and stated in the Bhagavad-gita (10.42). Thus the seventyfive
percent expansion of His radiation is called His internal energy, whereas the twenty-five percent
expansion is called the external energy of the Lord. The living entities, who are residents of the spiritual
as well as the material expansions, are His marginal energy (tatastha-sakti), and they are at liberty to live
in either of the energies, external or internal. Those who live within the spiritual expansion of the Lord
are called liberated souls, whereas the residents of the external expansion are called the conditioned souls.
We can just make an estimate of the number of the residents of the internal expansions in comparison
with the number of residents in the external energy and may easily conclude that the liberated souls are
far more numerous than the conditioned souls.
