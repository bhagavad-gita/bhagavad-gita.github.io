TRANSLATION
When the ruling administrators, who are known as the ksatriyas, turned astray from the path of the
Absolute Truth, being desirous to suffer in hell, the Lord, in His incarnation as the sage Parasurama,
uprooted those unwanted kings, who appeared as the thorns of the earth. Thus He thrice seven times
uprooted the ksatriyas with His keenly sharpened chopper.
PURPORT
The ksatriyas, or the ruling administrators of any part of the universe, either on this planet or on other
planets, are factually the representatives of the Almighty Personality of Godhead, and they are meant to
lead the subjects towards the path of God realization. Every state and its administrators, regardless of the
nature of the administration--monarchy or democracy, oligarchy or dictatorship or autocracy--have the
prime responsibility to lead the citizens toward God realization. This is essential for all human beings, and
it is the duty of the father, spiritual master, and ultimately the state to take up the responsibility of leading
the citizens towards this end. The whole creation of material existence is made for this purpose, just to
give a chance to the fallen souls who rebelled against the will of the Supreme Father and thus became
conditioned by material nature. The force of material nature gradually leads one to a hellish condition of
perpetual pains and miseries. Those going against the prescribed rules and regulations of conditional life
are called brahmojjhita-pathas, or persons going against the path of the Absolute Truth, and they are
liable to be punished. Lord Parasurama, the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, appeared in such a
state of worldly affairs and killed all the miscreant kings twenty-one times. Many ksatriya kings fled from
India to other parts of the world at that time, and according to the authority of the Mahabharata, the kings
of Egypt originally migrated from India because of Parasurama's program of chastisement. The kings or
administrators are similarly chastised in all circumstances whenever they become godless and plan a
godless civilization. That is the order of the Almighty.
