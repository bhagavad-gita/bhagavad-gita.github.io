<h2>Text</h2>
yo vanusayinam sargah
pasandasya ca sambhavah
atmano bandha-moksau ca
vyavasthanam sva-rupatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--all those; va--either; anusayinam--merged into the body of the Lord; sargah--creation; pasandasya--
of the infidels; ca--and; sambhavah--appearance; atmanah--of the living beings; bandha--conditioned;
moksau--being liberated; ca--also; vyavasthanam--being situated; sva-rupatah--in an unconditioned state.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Please also explain how, merged in the body of the Lord, living beings are created, and how the infidels
appear in the world. Also please explain how the unconditioned living entities exist.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The progressive devotee of the Lord must inquire from the bona fide spiritual master how living entities
merged in the body of the Lord again come back at the time of creation. There are two kinds of living
entities. There are the ever-liberated, unconditioned living beings as well as the ever-conditioned living
beings. Of the ever-conditioned living beings, there are two divisions. They are the faithful and the
infidels. Of the faithful there are again two divisions, namely the devotees and the mental speculators. The
mental speculators desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, or to become one with the Lord,
whereas the devotees of the Lord desire to keep separate identities and constantly engage in the service of
the Lord. The devotees who are not fully purified, as well as the empiric philosophers, become
conditioned again during the next creation for further purification. Such conditioned souls become
liberated by further progress of devotional service to the Lord. Maharaja Pariksit asked all these questions
from the bona fide spiritual master in order to become fully equipped in the science of God.
