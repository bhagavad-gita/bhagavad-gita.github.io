<h2>Text</h2>
nasike nirabhidyetam
dodhuyati nabhasvati
tatra vayur gandha-vaho
ghrano nasi jighrksatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nasike--in the nostrils; nirabhidyetam--being developed; dodhuyati--rapidly blowing; nabhasvati--air
respiration; tatra--thereupon; vayuh--air; gandha-vahah--smelling odor; ghranah--sense of smell; nasi--in
the nose; jighrksatah--desiring to smell odors.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, when the supreme purusa desired to smell odors, the nostrils and respiration were
generated, the nasal instrument and odors came into existence, and the controlling deity of air, carrying
smell, also became manifested.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The nasal instrument, odor, and the controlling deity air, smelling, etc., all became manifested
simultaneously when the Lord desired to smell. The Vedic mantras confirm this statement in the
Upanisads' statement that everything is first desired by the Supreme before the subordinate living entity
can act upon it. The living entity can see only when the Lord sees, the living entity can smell when the
Lord smells, and so on. The idea is that the living entity cannot do anything independently. He can simply
think of doing something independently, but he cannot act independently. This independence in thinking
is there by the grace of the Lord, but the thinking can be given shape by the grace of the Lord, and
therefore the common saying is that man proposes and God disposes. The whole explanation is on the
subject of the absolute dependence of the living entities and absolute independence of the Supreme Lord.
Less intelligent persons claiming to be on an equal level with God must first prove themselves to be
absolute and independent, and then they must substantiate their claim to being one with God.
