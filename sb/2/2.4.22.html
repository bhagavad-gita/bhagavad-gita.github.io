<h2>Translation</h2>
May the Lord, who in the beginning of the creation amplified the potent knowledge of Brahma from
within his heart and inspired him with full knowledge of creation and of His own Self, and who appeared
to be generated from the mouth of Brahma, be pleased with me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As we have already discussed hereinbefore, the Lord, as the Supersoul of all living beings from Brahma
to the insignificant ant, endows all with the required knowledge potent in every living being. A living
being is sufficiently potent to possess knowledge from the Lord in the proportion of fifty sixty-fourths, or
seventy-eight percent of the full knowledge acquirable. Since the living being is constitutionally part and
parcel of the Lord, he is unable to assimilate all the knowledge that the Lord possesses Himself. In the
conditioned state, the living being is subject to forget everything after a change of body known as death.
This potent knowledge is again inspired by the Lord from within the heart of every living being, and it is
known as the awakening of knowledge, for it is comparable to awakening from sleep or unconsciousness.
This awakening of knowledge is under the full control of the Lord, and therefore we find in the practical
world different grades of knowledge in different persons. This awakening of knowledge is neither an
automatic nor a material interaction. The supply source is the Lord Himself (dhiyam patih), for even
Brahma is also subject to this regulation of the supreme creator. In the beginning of the creation, Brahma
is born first without any father and mother because before Brahma there were no other living beings.
Brahma is born from the lotus which grows from the abdomen of the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and
therefore he is known as Aja. This Brahma, or Aja, is also a living being, part and parcel of the Lord, but
being the most pious devotee of the Lord, Brahma is inspired by the Lord to create, subsequent to the
main creation by the Lord, through the agency of material nature. Therefore neither the material nature
nor Brahma is independent of the Lord. The material scientists can merely observe the reactions of the
material nature without understanding the direction behind such activities, as a child can see the action of
electricity without any knowledge of the powerhouse engineer. This imperfect knowledge of the material
scientist is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The Vedic knowledge was therefore first impregnated within
Brahma, and it appears that Brahma distributed the Vedic knowledge. Brahma is undoubtedly the speaker
of the Vedic knowledge, but actually he was inspired by the Lord to receive such transcendental
knowledge, as it directly descends from the Lord. The Vedas are therefore called apauruseya, or not
imparted by any created being. Before the creation the Lord was there (narayanah paro 'vyaktat), and
therefore the words spoken by the Lord are vibrations of transcendental sound. There is a gulf of
difference between the two qualities of sound, namely prakrta and aprakrta. The physicist can deal only
with the prakrta sound, or sound vibrated in the material sky, and therefore we must know that the Vedic
sounds recorded in symbolic expressions cannot be understood by anyone within the universe unless and
until one is inspired by the vibration of supernatural (aprakrta) sound, which descends in the chain of
disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahma, from Brahma to Narada, from Narada to Vyasa and so on.
No mundane scholar can translate or reveal the true import of the Vedic mantras (hymns). They cannot
be understood unless one is inspired or initiated by the authorized spiritual master. The original spiritual
master is the Lord Himself, and the succession comes down through the sources of parampara, as clearly
stated in the Fourth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita. So unless one receives the transcendental knowledge
from the authorized parampara, one should be considered useless (viphala matah), even though one may
be greatly qualified in the mundane advancements of arts or science.
Sukadeva Gosvami is praying from the Lord by dint of being inspired from within by the Lord so that he
could rightly explain the facts and figures of creation as inquired by Maharaja Pariksit. A spiritual master
is not a theoretical speculator, like the mundane scholar, but is srotriyam brahma-nistham.
