<h2>Translation</h2>
From the forefront of the chest up to the neck of the universal form of the Lord are situated the
planetary systems named Janaloka and Tapoloka, whereas Satyaloka, the topmost planetary system, is
situated on the head of the form. The spiritual planets, however, are eternal.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Many times in these pages we have discussed the spiritual planets situated beyond the material sky, and
the description is corroborated in this verse. The word sanatana is significant. This very idea of eternity is
expressed in the Bhagavad-gita (8.20), where it is said that beyond the material creation is the spiritual
sky, where everything is eternal. Sometimes Satyaloka, the planet in which Brahma resides, is also called
Brahmaloka. But the Brahmaloka mentioned here is not the same as the Satyaloka planetary system. This
Brahmaloka is eternal, whereas the Satyaloka planetary system is not eternal. And to distinguish between
the two, the adjective sanatana has been used in this case. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, this
Brahmaloka is the loka or abode of Brahman, or the Supreme Lord. In the spiritual sky all the planets are
as good as the Lord Himself. The Lord is all spirit, and His name, fame, glories, qualities, pastimes, etc.,
are all nondifferent from Him because He is absolute. As such, the planets in the kingdom of God are also
nondifferent from Him. In those planets there is no difference between the body and the soul, nor is there
any influence of time as we experience it in the material world. And in addition to there being no
influence of time, the planets in, Brahmaloka, due to being spiritual, are never annihilated. All
variegatedness in the spiritual planets is also one with the Lord, and therefore the Vedic aphorism ekam
evadvitiyam is fully realized in that sanatana atmosphere of spiritual variegatedness. This material world is
only a shadow phantasmagoria of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and because it is a shadow it is never
eternal; the variegatedness in the material world of duality (spirit and matter) cannot be compared to that
of the spiritual world. Because of a poor fund of knowledge, less intelligent persons sometimes mistake
the conditions of the shadow world to be equivalent to those of the spiritual world, and thus they mistake
the Lord and His pastimes in the material world to be one with the conditioned souls and their activities.
The Lord condemns such less intelligent persons in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11):
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
Whenever the Lord incarnates, He does so in His full internal potency (atma-maya), and less intelligent
persons mistake Him to be one of the material creations. Srila Sridhara Svami, therefore, rightly
commenting on this verse, says that the Brahmaloka mentioned here is Vaikuntha, the kingdom of God,
which is sanatana, or eternal, and is therefore not exactly like the material creations described above. The
virat universal form of the Lord is an imagination for the material world. It has nothing to do with the
spiritual world, or the kingdom of God.
