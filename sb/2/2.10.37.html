etan matam samatistha
paramena samadhina
bhavan kalpa-vikalpesu
na vimuhyati karhicit
SYNONYMS
etat--this; matam--the conclusion; samatistha--remain fixed; paramena--by the supreme; samadhina--
concentration of the mind; bhavan--yourself; kalpa--intermediate devastation; vikalpesu--in the final
devastation; na vimuhyati--will never bewilder; karhicit--anything like complacence.
TRANSLATION
O Brahma, just follow this conclusion by fixed concentration of mind, and no pride will disturb you,
neither in the partial nor in the final devastation.
PURPORT
As in the Bhagavad-gita, Tenth Chapter, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, has summarized the
whole text in four verses, namely, aham sarvasya prabhavah, etc., so the complete Srimad-Bhagavatam has
also been summarized in four verses, as aham evasam evagre, etc. Thus the secret purpose of the most
important Bhagavatite conclusion has been explained by the original speaker of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
who was also the original speaker of the Bhagavad-gita, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna. There
are many grammarians and nondevotee material wranglers who have tried to present false interpretations
of these four verses of the Srimad-Bhagavatam but the Lord Himself advised Brahmaji not to be deviated
from the fixed conclusion the Lord had taught him. The Lord was the teacher of the nucleus of Srimad-
Bhagavatam in four verses, and Brahma was the receiver of the knowledge. Misinterpretation of the word
aham by the word jugglery of the impersonalist should not disturb the mind of the strict followers of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam. Srimad-Bhagavatam is the text of the Personality of Godhead and His unalloyed
devotees, who are also known as the bhagavatas, and any outsider should have no access to this
confidential literature of devotional service. But unfortunately the impersonalist, who has no relation to
the Supreme personality of Godhead, sometimes tries to interpret Srimad-Bhagavatam by his poor fund of
knowledge in grammar and dry speculation. Therefore, the Lord warns Brahma (and, through Brahma, all
future devotees of the Lord in the disciplic succession of Brahma) that one should never be misled by the
conclusion of the so-called grammarians or by other men with a poor fund of knowledge, but must always
fix the mind properly, via the parampara system. No one should try to give a new interpretation by dint of
mundane knowledge. And the first step, therefore, in pursuance of the system of knowledge received by
Brahma, is to approach a bona fide guru who is the representative of the Lord following the parampara
system. No one should try to squeeze out his own meaning b imperfect mundane knowledge. The guru,
or the bona fide spiritual master, is competent to teach the disciple in the right path with reference to the
context of all authentic Vedic literature. He does not attempt to juggle words to bewilder the student. The
bona fide spiritual master, by his personal activities, teaches the disciple the principles of devotional
service. Without personal service, one would go on speculating like the impersonalists and dry
speculators life after life and would be unable to reach the final conclusion. By following the instructions
of the bona fide spiritual master in conjunction with the principles of revealed scriptures, the student will
rise to the plane of complete knowledge, which will be exhibited by development of detachment from the
world of sense gratification. The mundane wranglers are surprised that one can detach himself from the
world of sense gratification, and thus any attempt to be fixed in God realization appears to them to be
mysticism. This detachment from the sensory world is called the brahma-bhuta stage of realization, the
preliminary stage of transcendental devotional life (para bhaktih). The brahma-bhuta stage of life is also
known as the atmarama stage, in which one is fully self-satisfied and does not hanker for the world of
sense enjoyment. This stage of full satisfaction is the proper situation for understanding the
transcendental knowledge of the Personality of Godhead. The Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.20) affirms this:
evam prasanna-manaso
bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah
bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam
mukta-sangasya jayate
Thus in the completely satisfied stage of life, exhibited by full detachment from the world of sense
enjoyment as a result of performing devotional service, one can understand the science of God in the
liberated stage.
In this stage of full satisfaction and detachment from the sensory world, one can know the mystery of
the science of God with all its confidential intricacies, and not by grammar or academic speculation.
Because Brahma qualified himself for such reception, the Lord was pleased to disclose the purpose of
Srimad-Bhagavatam. This direct instruction by the Lord to any devotee who is detached from the world of
sense gratification is possible, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (10.10):
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
Unto the devotees who are constantly engaged in the Lord's transcendental loving service (pritipurvakam),
the Lord, out of His causeless mercy upon the devotee, gives direct instructions so that the
devotee may make accurate progress on the path returning home, back to Godhead. One should not,
therefore, try to understand these four verses of Srimad-Bhagavatam by mental speculation. Rather, by
direct perception of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is able to know all about His abode,
Vaikuntha, as was seen and experienced by Brahmaji. Such Vaikuntha realization is possible by any
devotee of the Lord situated in the transcendental position as a result of devotional service.
In the Gopala-tapani Upanisad (sruti) it is said, gopa-veso me purusah purastad avirbabhuva: the Lord
appeared before Brahma as a cowboy, that is, as the original Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna,
Govinda, who is later described by Brahmaji in his Brahma-samhita (5.29):
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksalaksavrtesu
surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Brahmaji desires to worship the original personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, who resides in the
topmost Vaikuntha planet, known as Goloka Vrndavana, where He is in the habit of keeping surabhi cows
as a cowboy and where He is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune (the gopis) with
love and respect.
Therefore Lord Sri Krsna is the original form of the Supreme Lord (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam). This is
also clear from this instruction. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Lord Krsna, and not directly
Narayana or the purusa-avataras, which are subsequent manifestations. Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam
means consciousness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Sri Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is
the sound representation of the Lord as much as the Bhagavad-gita is. Thus the conclusion is that Srimad-
Bhagavatam is the science of the Lord in which the Lord and His abode are perfectly realized.
