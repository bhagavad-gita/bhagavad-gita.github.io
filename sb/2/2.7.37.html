<h2>Translation</h2>
When the atheists, after being well versed in the Vedic scientific knowledge, annihilate inhabitants of
different planets, flying unseen in the sky on well-built rockets prepared by the great scientist Maya, the
Lord will bewilder their minds by dressing Himself attractively as Buddha and will preach on subreligious
principles.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This incarnation of Lord Buddha is not the same Buddha incarnation we have in the present history of
mankind. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, the Buddha incarnation mentioned in this verse appeared in a
different Kali age. In the duration of life of one Manu there are more than seventy-two Kali-yugas, and in
one of them the particular type of Buddha mentioned here would appear. Lord Buddha incarnates at a
time when the people are most materialistic and preaches common-sense religious principles. Such
ahimsa is not a religious principle itself, but it is an important quality for persons who are actually
religious. It is a common-sense religion because one is advised to do no harm to any other animal or
living being because such harmful actions are equally harmful to he who does the harm. But before
learning these principles of nonviolence one has to learn two other principles, namely to be humble and
to be prideless. Unless one is humble and prideless, one cannot be harmless and nonviolent. And after
being nonviolent one has to learn tolerance and simplicity of living. One must offer respects to the great
religious preachers and spiritual leaders and also train the senses for controlled action, learning to be
unattached to family and home, and enacting devotional service to the Lord, etc. At the ultimate stage one
has to accept the Lord and become His devotee; otherwise there is no religion. In religious principles
there must be God in the center; otherwise simple moral instructions are merely subreligious principles,
generally known as upadharma, or nearness to religious principles.
