na me 'savah parayanti
brahmann anasanad ami
pibato 'cyuta-piyusam
tad vakyabdhi-vinihsrtam
SYNONYMS
na--never; me--mine; asavah--life; parayanti--becomes exhausted; brahman--O learned brahmana;
anasanat ami--because of fasting; pibatah--because of my drinking; acyuta--of the infallible; piyusam--
nectar; tat--your; vakya-abdhi--ocean of speech; vinihsrtam--flowing down from.
TRANSLATION
O learned brahmana, because of my drinking the nectar of the message of the infallible Personality of
Godhead, which is flowing down from the ocean of your speeches, I do not feel any sort of exhaustion
due to my fasting.
PURPORT
The disciplic succession from Brahma, Narada, Vyasa and Sukadeva Gosvami is particularly different
from others. The disciplic successions from other sages are simply a waste of time, being devoid of acyutakatha,
or the message of the infallible Lord. The mental speculators can present their theories very nicely
by reason and arguments, but such reasons and arguments are not infallible, for they are defeated by
better mental speculators. Maharaja Pariksit was not interested in the dry speculation of the flickering
mind, but he was interested in the topics of the Lord because factually he felt that by hearing such a
nectarean message from the mouth of Sukadeva Gosvami he was not feeling any exhaustion, even though
he was fasting because of his imminent death.
One can indulge in hearing the mental speculators, but such hearing cannot endure for any length of
time. One will be exhausted very soon from hearing such hackneyed ways of thinking, and no one in the
world can be satisfied simply by hearing such useless speculations. The message of the Lord, especially
from a personality like Sukadeva Gosvami, can never be tiring, even though one may be exhausted from
other causes.
In some editions of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the text of the last line of this verse reads anyatra kupitad
dvijat, which means that the King might be overwhelmed by the thought of his imminent death by
snakebite. The snake is also twice-born, and its anger is compared to the cursing brahmana boy who was
without good intelligence. Maharaja Pariksit was not at all afraid of death, for he was fully encouraged by
the message of the Lord. One who is fully absorbed in acyuta-katha can never be afraid of anything in this
world.
