<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord was seated on His throne and was surrounded by different energies like the four, the sixteen,
the five, and the six natural opulences, along with other insignificant energies of the temporary character.
But He was the factual Supreme Lord, enjoying His own abode.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is naturally endowed with His six opulences. Specifically, He is the richest, He is the most
powerful, He is the most famous, He is the most beautiful, He is the greatest in knowledge, and He is the
greatest renouncer as well. And for His material creative energies, He is served by four, namely the
principles of prakrti, purusa, mahat-tattva and ego. He is also served by the sixteen, namely the five
elements (earth, water, air, fire and sky), the five perceptive sense organs (the eye, ear, nose, tongue and
skin), and the five working sense organs (the hand, the leg, the stomach, the evacuation outlet and the
genitals), and the mind. The five includes the sense objects, namely form, taste, smell, sound and touch.
All these twenty-five items serve the Lord in the material creation, and all of them are personally present
to serve the Lord. The insignificant opulences numbering eight (the asta-siddhis, attained by yogis for
temporary overlordship) are also under His control, but He is naturally full with all such powers without
any effort, and therefore He is the Supreme Lord.
The living being, by severe penance and performance of bodily exercises, can temporarily attain some
wonderful power, but that does not make him the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord, by His own potency,
is unlimitedly more powerful than any yogi, He is unlimitedly more learned than any jnani, He is
unlimitedly richer than any wealthy person, He is unlimitedly more beautiful than any beautiful living
being, and He is unlimitedly more charitable than any philanthropist. He is above all; no one is equal to or
greater than Him. Nor can anyone reach His level of perfection in any of the above powers by any amount
of penance or yogic demonstrations. The yogis are dependent on His mercy. Out of His immensely
charitable disposition He can award some temporary powers to the yogis because of the yogis hankering
after them, but to His unalloyed devotees, who do not want anything from the Lord save and except His
transcendental service, the Lord is so pleased that He gives Himself in exchange for unalloyed service.
