<h2>Translation</h2>
Others conceive of the Personality of Godhead residing within the body in the region of the heart and
measuring only eight inches, with four hands carrying a lotus, a wheel of a chariot, a conchshell and a
club respectively.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The all-pervading personality of Godhead resides as Paramatma in the heart of each and every living
entity. The measurement of the localized Personality of Godhead is estimated to expand from the ring
finger to the end of the thumb, more or less eight inches. The form of the Lord described in this verse
with distribution of different symbols--beginning from the lower right hand up and down to the lower left
hand with lotus, wheel of a chariot, conchshell and club respectively--is called Janardana, or the plenary
portion of the Lord who controls the general mass. There are many other forms of the Lord with varied
situations of the symbols of lotus, conchshell, etc., and they are differently known as Purusottama,
Acyuta, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Hrsikesa, Kesava, Madhava, Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Sankarsana,
Sridhara, Vasudeva, Damodara, Janardana, Narayana, Hari, Padmanabha, Vamana, Madhusudana,
Govinda, Krsna, Visnumurti, Adhoksaja and Upendra. These twenty-four forms of the localized
Personality of Godhead are worshiped in different parts of the planetary system, and in each system there
is an incarnation of the Lord having a different Vaikuntha planet in the spiritual sky, which is called the
paravyoma. There are many other hundreds and scores of different forms of the Lord, and each and every
one of them has a particular planet in the spiritual sky, of which this material sky is only a fragmental
offshoot. The Lord exists as purusa, or the male enjoyer, although there is no comparing Him to any male
form in the material world. But all such forms are advaita, nondifferent from one another, and each of
them is eternally young. The young Lord with four hands is nicely decorated, as described below.
