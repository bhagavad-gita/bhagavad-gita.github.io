TRANSLATION
For those who are wandering in the material universe, there is no more auspicious means of deliverance
than what is aimed at in the direct devotional service of Lord Krsna.
PURPORT
As will be clarified in the next verse, devotional service, or direct bhakti-yoga, is the only absolute and
auspicious means of deliverance from the grip of material existence. There are many indirect methods for
deliverance from the clutches of material existence, but none of them is as easy and auspicious as bhaktiyoga.
The means of jnana and yoga and other allied disciplines are not independent in delivering a
performer. Such activities help one to reach the stage of bhakti-yoga after many, many years. In the
Bhagavad-gita (12.5) it is said that those who are attached to the impersonal feature of the Absolute are
liable to many troubles in the pursuit of their desired goal, and the empiricist philosophers, searching
after the Absolute Truth, realize the importance of Vasudeva realization as all in all after many, many
births (Bg. 7.19). As far as yoga systems are concerned, it is also said in the Bhagavad-gita (6.47) that
amongst the mystics who pursue the Absolute Truth, the one who is always engaged in the service of the
Lord is the greatest of all. And the last instruction in the Bhagavad-gita (18.66) advises fully surrendering
unto the Lord, leaving aside all other engagements or different processes for self-realization and liberation
from material bondage. And the purport of all Vedic literatures is to induce one to accept the
transcendental loving service of the Lord by all means.
As already explained in the texts of Srimad-Bhagavatam (First Canto), either direct bhakti-yoga or the
means which ultimately culminate in bhakti-yoga, without any tinge of fruitive activity, constitutes the
highest form of religion. Everything else is simply a waste of time for the performer.
Srila Sridhara Svami and all other acaryas, like Jiva Gosvami, agree that bhakti-yoga is not only easy,
simple, natural and free from trouble, but is the only source of happiness for the human being.
