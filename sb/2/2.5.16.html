TRANSLATION
Let me offer my respectful obeisances again and again unto the all-auspicious Lord Sri Krsna. The highly
intellectual, simply by surrendering unto His lotus feet, are relieved of all attachments to present and
future existences and without difficulty progress toward spiritual existence.
PURPORT
Lord Sri Krsna has repeatedly instructed Arjuna, or for that matter everyone concerned with becoming
His unalloyed devotee. In the last phase of His instruction in the Bhagavad-gita (18.64-66) He instructed
most confidentially as follows:
sarva-guhyatamam bhuyah
srnu me paramam vacah
isto 'si me drdham iti
tato vaksyami te hitam
man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
mad-yaji mam namaskuru
mam evaisyasi satyam te
pratijane priyo 'si me
sarva-dharman parityajya
mam ekam saranam vraja
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo
moksayisyami ma sucah
"My dear Arjuna, you are very dear to Me, and therefore only for your good I will disclose the most
secret part of My instructions. It is simply this: become a pure devotee of Mine and give yourself unto Me
only, and I promise you full spiritual existence, by which you may gain the eternal right of transcendental
loving service unto Me. Just give up all other ways of religiosity and exclusively surrender unto Me and
believe that I will protect you from your sinful acts, and I shall deliver you. Do not worry any more."
Persons who are intelligent take serious notice of this last instruction of the Lord. Knowledge of the self
is the first step in spiritual realization, which is called confidential knowledge, and a step further is God
realization, which is called more confidential knowledge. The culmination of the knowledge of Bhagavadgita
is God realization, and when one attains this stage of God realization, he naturally, voluntarily
becomes a devotee of the Lord to render Him loving transcendental service. This devotional service to the
Lord is always based on love of God and is distinct from the nature of routine service as prescribed in
karma-yoga, jnana-yoga or dhyana-yoga. In the Bhagavad-gita there are different instructions for such
men of different categories, and there are various descriptions for varnasrama-dharma, sannyasa-dharma,
yati-dharma, the renounced order of life, controlling the senses, meditation, perfection of mystic powers,
etc., but one who fully surrenders unto the Lord to render service unto Him, out of spontaneous love for
Him, factually assimilates the essence of all knowledge described in the Vedas. One who adopts this
method very skillfully attains perfection of life at once. And this perfection of human life is called brahmagati,
or the progressive march in spiritual existence. As enunciated by Srila Jiva Gosvami on the basis of
Vedic assurances, brahma-gati means to attain a spiritual form as good as that of the Lord, and in that
form the liberated living being eternally lives on one of the spiritual planets situated in the spiritual sky.
Attainment of this perfection of life is easily available to a pure devotee of the Lord without his
undergoing any difficult method of perfection. Such a devotional life is full of kirtanam, smaranam,
iksanam, etc., as mentioned in the previous verse. One must therefore adopt this simple way of devotional
life in order to attain the highest perfection available in any category of the human form of life in any part
of the world. When Lord Brahma met Lord Krsna as a playful child at Vrndavana, he offered his prayer in
which he said:
sreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho
klisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye
tesam asau klesala eva sisyate
nanyad yatha sthula-tusavaghatinam
(Bhag. 10.14.4)
Bhakti-yoga is the highest quality of perfection to be achieved by the intelligent person in lieu of
performing a large quantity of spiritual activities. The example cited here is very appropriate. A handful of
real paddy is more valuable than heaps of paddy skins without any substance within. Similarly, one
should not be attracted by the jugglery of karma-kanda or jnana-kanda or even the gymnastic
performances of yoga, but skillfully should take to the simple performances of kirtanam, smaranam, etc.,
under a bona fide spiritual master, and without any difficulty attain the highest perfection.
