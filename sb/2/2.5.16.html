<h2>Text</h2>
narayana-paro yogo
narayana-param tapah
narayana-param jnanam
narayana-para gatih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
narayana-parah--just to know Narayana; yogah--concentration of mind; narayana-param--just with an
aim to achieve Narayana; tapah--austerity; narayana-param--just to realize a glimpse of Narayana;
jnanam--culture of transcendental knowledge; narayana-para--the path of salvation ends by entering the
kingdom of Narayana; gatih--progressive path.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All different types of meditation or mysticism are means for realizing Narayana. All austerities are aimed
at achieving Narayana. Culture of transcendental knowledge is for getting a glimpse of Narayana, and
ultimately salvation is entering the kingdom of Narayana.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In meditation, there are two systems of yoga, namely astanga-yoga and sankhya-yoga. Astanga-yoga is
practice in concentrating the mind, releasing oneself from all engagements by the regulative processes of
meditation, concentration, sitting postures, blocking the movements of the internal circulation of air, etc.
Sankhya-yoga is meant to distinguish the truth from ephemerals. But ultimately both the systems are
meant for realizing the impersonal Brahman, which is but a partial representation of Narayana, the
Personality of Godhead. As we have explained before, the impersonal Brahman effulgence is only a part of
the Personality of Godhead. Impersonal Brahman is situated on the person of the Supreme personality of
Godhead, and as such, Brahman is the glorification of the personality of the Godhead. This is confirmed
both in the Bhagavad-gita and in the Matsya Purana. Gati refers to the ultimate destination, or the last
word in liberation. Oneness with the impersonal brahmajyoti is not ultimate liberation; superior to that is
the sublime association of the Personality of Godhead in one of the innumerable spiritual planets in the
Vaikuntha sky. Therefore the conclusion is that Narayana, or the Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate
destination for all kinds of yoga systems as well as all kinds of liberation.
