<h2>Translation</h2>
To exhibit His personal way of austerity and penance, He appeared in twin forms as Narayana and Nara
in the womb of Murti, the wife of Dharma and the daughter of Daksa. Celestial beauties, the companions
of Cupid, went to try to break His vows, but they were unsuccessful, for they saw that many beauties like
them were emanating from Him, the Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord, being the source of everything that be, is the origin of all austerities and penances also. Great
vows of austerity are undertaken by sages to achieve success in self-realization. Human life is meant for
such tapasya, with the great vow of celibacy, or brahmacarya. In the rigid life of tapasya, there is no place
for the association of women. And because human life is meant for tapasya, for self-realization, factual
human civilization, as conceived by the system of sanatana-dharma or the school of four castes and four
orders of life, prescribes rigid dissociation from woman in three stages of life. In the order of gradual
cultural development, one's life may be divided into four divisions: celibacy, household life, retirement,
and renunciation. During the first stage of life, up to twenty-five years of age, a man may be trained as a
brahmacari under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master just to understand that woman is the real
binding force in material existence. If one wants to get freedom from the material bondage of conditional
life, he must get free from the attraction for the form of woman. Woman, or the fair sex, is the enchanting
principle for the living entities, and the male form, especially in the human being, is meant for selfrealization.
The whole world is moving under the spell of womanly attraction, and as soon as a man
becomes united with a woman, he at once becomes a victim of material bondage under a tight knot. The
desires for lording it over the material world, under the intoxication of a false sense of lordship,
specifically begin just after the man's unification with a woman. The desires for acquiring a house,
possessing land, having children and becoming prominent in society, the affection for community and the
place of birth, and the hankering for wealth, which are all like phantasmagoria or illusory dreams,
encumber a human being, and he is thus impeded in his progress toward self-realization, the real aim of
life. The brahmacari, or a boy from the age of five years, especially from the higher castes, namely from
the scholarly parents (the brahmanas), the administrative parents (the ksatriyas), or the mercantile or
productive parents (the vaisyas), is trained until twenty-five years of age under the care of a bona fide
guru or teacher, and under strict observance of discipline he comes to understand the values of life along
with taking specific training for a livelihood. The brahmacari is then allowed to go home and enter
householder life and get married to a suitable woman. But there are many brahmacaris who do not go
home to become householders but continue the life of naisthika-brahmacaris, without any connection
with women. They accept the order of sannyasa, or the renounced order of life, knowing well that
combination with women is an unnecessary burden that checks self-realization. Since sex desire is very
strong at a certain stage of life, the guru may allow the brahmacari to marry; this license is given to a
brahmacari who is unable to continue the way of naisthika-brahmacarya, and such discriminations are
possible for the bona fide guru. A program of so-called family planning is needed. The householder who
associates with woman under scriptural restrictions, after a thorough training of brahmacarya, cannot be a
householder like cats and dogs. Such a householder, after fifty years of age, would retire from the
association of woman as a vanaprastha to be trained to live alone without the association of woman.
When the practice is complete, the same retired householder becomes a sannyasi, strictly separate from
woman, even from his married wife. Studying the whole scheme of disassociation from women, it appears
that a woman is a stumbling block for self-realization, and the Lord appeared as Narayana to teach the
principle of womanly disassociation with a vow in life. The demigods, being envious of the austere life of
the rigid brahmacaris, would try to cause them to break their vows by dispatching soldiers of Cupid. But
in the case of the Lord, it became an unsuccessful attempt when the celestial beauties saw that the Lord
can produce innumerable such beauties by His mystic internal potency and that there was consequently
no need to be attracted by others externally. There is a common proverb that a confectioner is never
attracted by sweetmeats. The confectioner, who is always manufacturing sweetmeats, has very little desire
to eat them; similarly, the Lord, by His pleasure potential powers, can produce innumerable spiritual
beauties and not be the least attracted by the false beauties of material creation. One who does not know
alleges foolishly that Lord Krsna enjoyed women in His rasa-lila in Vrndavana, or with His sixteen
thousand married wives at Dvaraka.
