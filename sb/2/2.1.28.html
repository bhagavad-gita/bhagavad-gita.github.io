<h2>Translation</h2>
The chest of the Original Personality of the gigantic form is the luminary planetary system, His neck is
the Mahar planets, His mouth is the Janas planets, and His forehead is the Tapas planetary system. The
topmost planetary system, known as Satyaloka, is the head of He who has one thousand heads.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The effulgent luminary planets like the sun and the moon are situated almost in the midplace of the
universe, and as such they are to be known as the chest of the original gigantic form of the Lord. And
above the luminary planets, called also the heavenly places of the universal directorate demigods, are the
Mahar, Janas and Tapas planetary systems, and, above all, the Satyaloka planetary system, where the chief
directors of the modes of material nature reside, namely Visnu, Brahma and Siva. This Visnu is known as
the Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and He acts as the Supersoul in every living being. There are innumerable
universes floating on the Causal Ocean, and in each of them the representation of the virat form of the
Lord is there along with innumerable suns, moons, heavenly demigods, Brahmas, Visnus and Sivas, all of
them situated in one part of the inconceivable potency of Lord Krsna, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita
(10.42).
