TRANSLATION
Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-auspicious Lord Sri Krsna, about whom glorification,
remembrances, audience, prayers, hearing and worship can at once cleanse the effects of all sins of the
performer.
PURPORT
The sublime form of religious performances to free oneself from all reactions of sins is suggested herein
by the greatest authority, Sri Sukadeva Gosvami. Kirtanam, or glorifying the Lord, can be performed in
very many ways, such as remembering, visiting temples to see the Deity, offering prayers in front of the
Lord, and hearing recitations of glorification of the Lord as they are mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam
or in the Bhagavad-gita. Kirtanam can be performed both by singing the glories of the Lord in
accompaniment with melodious music and by recitation of scriptures like Srimad-Bhagavatam or
Bhagavad-gita.
The devotees need not be disappointed in the physical absence of the Lord, though they may think of
not being associated with Him. The devotional process of chanting, hearing, remembering, etc., (either all
or some of them, or even one of them) can give us the desired result of associating with the Lord by
discharging the transcendental loving service of the Lord in the above manner. Even the very sound of the
holy name of Lord Krsna or Rama can at once surcharge the atmosphere spiritually. We must know
definitely that the Lord is present wherever such pure transcendental service is performed, and thus the
performer of offenseless kirtanam has positive association with the Lord. Similarly, remembrance and
prayers also can give us the desired result if they are properly done under expert guidance. One should
not concoct forms of devotional service. One may worship the form of the Lord in a temple, or one may
impersonally offer the Lord devotional prayers in a mosque or a church. One is sure to get free from the
reactions of sins provided one is very careful about not committing sins willingly in expectation of getting
free from the reactions of sins by worshiping in the temple or by offering prayers in the church. This
mentality of committing sins willfully on the strength of devotional service is called namno balad yasya hi
papa-buddhih, and it is the greatest offense in the discharge of devotional service. Hearing, therefore, is
essential in order to keep oneself strictly on guard against such pitfalls of sins. And in order to give special
stress to the hearing process, the Gosvami invokes all auspicious fortune in this matter.
