the heavenly King, Indra, and one who desires good progeny should worship the great progenitors called
the Prajapatis. One who desires good fortune should worship Durgadevi, the superintendent of the
material world. One desiring to be very powerful should worship fire, and one who aspires only after
money should worship the Vasus. One should worship the Rudra incarnations of Lord Siva if he wants to
be a great hero. One who wants a large stock of grains should worship Aditi. One who desires to attain the
heavenly planets should worship the sons of Aditi. One who desires a worldly kingdom should worship
Visvadeva, and one who wants to be popular with the general mass of population should worship the
Sadhya demigod. One who desires a long span of life should worship the demigods known as the Asvinikumaras,
and a person desiring a strongly built body should worship the earth. One who desires stability
in his post should worship the horizon and the earth combined. One who desires to be beautiful should
worship the beautiful residents of the Gandharva planet, and one who desires a good wife should worship

demigod Varuna. If one desires to be a greatly learned man he should worship Lord Siva, and if one
desires a good marital relation he should worship the chaste goddess Uma, the wife of Lord Siva.

<h2>Purport</h2>
There are different modes of worship for different persons desiring success in particular subjects. The
conditioned soul living within the purview of the material world cannot be an expert in every type of
materially enjoyable asset, but one can have considerable influence over a particular matter by worshiping
a particular demigod, as mentioned above. Ravana was made a very powerful man by worshiping Lord
Siva, and he used to offer severed heads to please Lord Siva. He became so powerful by the grace of Lord
Siva that all the demigods were afraid of him, until he at last challenged the Personality of Godhead Sri
Ramacandra and thus ruined himself. In other words, all such persons who aspire after gaining some or
all of the material objects of enjoyment, or the gross materialistic persons, are on the whole less
intelligent, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (7.20). It is said there that those who are bereft of all good
sense, or those whose intelligence is withdrawn by the deluding energy of maya, aspire to achieve all sorts
of material enjoyment in life by pleasing the various demigods, or by advancing in material civilization
under the heading of scientific progress. The real problem of life in the material world is to solve the
question of birth, death, old age and disease. No one wants to change his birthright, no one wants to meet
death, no one wants to be old or invalid, and no one wants diseases. But these problems are solved neither
by the grace of any demigod nor by the so-called advancement of material science. In the Bhagavad-gita,
as well as in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, such less intelligent persons have been described as devoid of all
good sense. Sukadeva Gosvami said that out of the 8,400,000 species of living entities, the human form of
life is rare and valuable, and out of those rare human beings those who are conscious of the material
problems are rarer still, and the still more rare persons are those who are conscious of the value of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, which contains the messages of the Lord and His pure devotees. Death is inevitable
for everyone, intelligent or foolish. But Pariksit Maharaja has been addressed by the Gosvami as the
manisi, or the man of highly developed mind, because at the time of death he left all material enjoyment
and completely surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord by hearing His messages from the right person,
Sukadeva Gosvami. But aspirations for material enjoyment by endeavoring persons are condemned. Such
aspirations are something like the intoxication of the degraded human society. Intelligent persons should
try to avoid these aspirations and seek instead the permanent life by returning home, back to Godhead.
