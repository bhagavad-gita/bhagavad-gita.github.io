<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

matter; ca--also; sva-cestitam--seriously by one's own endeavor; kalena--duration; na--not; ati-dirghena--
very prolonged time; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna; visate--becomes manifest; hrdi--
within one's heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who hear Srimad-Bhagavatam regularly and are always taking the matter very seriously will
have the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna manifested in their hearts within a short time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Cheap devotees or materialistic devotees of the Lord are very much desirous to see the Lord personally
without meeting the requisite qualifications. Such third-grade devotees should know well that material
attachment and seeing the Lord face to face cannot go together. It is not such a mechanical process that
the professional Bhagavatam reciters can do the job on behalf of the third-grade materialistic pseudodevotee.
The professional men are useless in this connection because they are neither self-realized nor
interested in the liberation of the audience. They are simply interested in maintaining the material
establishment of family attachment and earning some material benefits out of the profession. Maharaja
Pariksit had no more than seven days to live, but for others Maharaja Pariksit personally recommends that
one hear Srimad-Bhagavatam regularly, nityam, always by one's own effort and with serious devotion also.
That will help one to see the Lord Sri Krsna manifested in one's heart within no time.
The pseudo-devotee, however, is very anxious to see the Lord according to his whims, not making any
serious effort to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam regularly and without detachment from material benefit. That is
not the way recommended by an authority like Maharaja Pariksit, who heard and benefited by hearing
Srimad-Bhagavatam.
