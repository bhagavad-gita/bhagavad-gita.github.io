<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Brahma is the topmost devotee of the Lord within the universe, and therefore the Personality of
Godhead replied to his four principal inquiries in four important statements, which are known as the
original Bhagavatam in four verses. These were Brahma's questions: (1) What are the forms of the Lord
both in matter and in transcendence? (2) How are the different energies of the Lord working? (3) How
does the Lord play with His different energies? (4) How may Brahma be instructed to discharge the duty
entrusted to Him? The prelude to the answers is this verse under discussion, wherein the Lord informs
Brahma that knowledge of Him, the Supreme Absolute Truth, as it is stated in the revealed scriptures, is
very subtle and cannot be understood unless one is self-realized by the grace of the Lord. The Lord says
that Brahma may take the answers as He explains them. This means that transcendental knowledge of the
absolute Supreme Being can be known if it is made known by the Lord Himself. By the mental speculation
of the greatest mundane thinkers, the Absolute Truth cannot be understood. The mental speculators can
reach up to the standard of impersonal Brahman realization, but, factually, complete knowledge of
transcendence is beyond the knowledge of impersonal Brahman. Thus it is called the supreme confidential
wisdom. Out of many liberated souls, someone may be qualified to know the Personality of Godhead. In
the Bhagavad-gita it is also said by the Lord Himself that out of many hundreds of thousands of people,
one may try for perfection in human life, and out of many liberated souls, one may know Him as He is.
Therefore, the knowledge of the Personality of Godhead may be attained by devotional service only.
Rahasyam means devotional service. Lord Krsna instructed Arjuna in the Bhagavad-gita because He found
Arjuna to be a devotee and friend. Without such qualifications, one cannot enter into the mystery of the
Bhagavad-gita Therefore, one cannot understand the Personality of Godhead unless one becomes a
devotee and discharges devotional service. This mystery is love of Godhead. Therein lies the main
qualification for knowing the mystery of the Personality of Godhead. And to attain the stage of
transcendental love of Godhead, regulative principles of devotional service must be followed. The
regulative principles are called vidhi-bhakti, or the devotional service of the Lord, and they can be
practiced by a neophyte with his present senses. Such regulative principles are mainly based on hearing
and chanting of the glories of the Lord. And such hearing and chanting of the glories of the Lord can be
made possible in the association of devotees only. Lord Caitanya therefore recommended five main
principles for attaining perfection in the devotional service of the Lord. The first is association with
devotees (hearing); second is chanting the glories of the Lord; third, hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam from the
pure devotee; fourth, residing in a holy place connected with the Lord; and fifth, worshiping the Deity of
the Lord with devotion. Such rules and regulations are parts of devotional service. So, as requested by
Lord Brahma, the personality of Godhead will explain all about the four questions put forward by Brahma,
and others also which are parts and parcels of the same questions.
