<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vrida--modesty; uttara--upper; osthah--lip; adharah--chin; eva--certainly; lobhah--hankering; dharmah--
religion; stanah--breast; adharma--irreligion; pathah--way; asya--His; prstham--back; kah--Brahma; tasya--
His; medhram--genitals; vrsanau--testicles; ca--also; mitrau--the Mitra-varunas; kuksih--waist; samudrah--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Modesty is the upper portion of His lips, hankering is His chin, religion is the breast of the Lord, and
irreligion is His back. Brahmaji, who generates all living beings in the material world, is His genitals, and
the Mitra-varunas are His two testicles. The ocean is His waist, and the hills and mountains are the stacks
of His bones.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord is not impersonal, as misconceived by less intelligent thinkers. Rather, He is the
Supreme person, as confirmed in all authentic Vedic literatures. But His personality is different from what
we can conceive. It is stated here that Brahmaji acts as His genitals and that the Mitra-varunas are His two
testicles. This means that as a person He is complete with all bodily organs, but they are of different types
with different potencies. When the Lord is described as impersonal, therefore, it should be understood
that His personality is not exactly the type of personality found within our imperfect speculation. One
can, however, worship the Lord even by seeing the hills and mountains or the ocean and the sky as
different parts and parcels of the gigantic body of the Lord, the virat-purusa. The virat-rupa, as exhibited
by Lord Krsna to Arjuna, is a challenge to the unbelievers.
