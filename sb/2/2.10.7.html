<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The supreme one who is celebrated as the Supreme Being or the Supreme Soul is the supreme source of
the cosmic manifestation as well as its reservoir and winding up. Thus He is the Supreme Fountainhead,
the Absolute Truth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Synonyms for the supreme source of all energies, as explained in the very beginning of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, are janmady asya yatah, vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam. brahmeti
paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate, called Parambrahma, Paramatma or Bhagavan. The word iti used here
in this verse completes the synonyms and thus indicates Bhagavan. This will be further explained in the
later verses, but this Bhagavan ultimately means Lord Krsna because the Srimad-Bhagavatam has already
accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Krsna. Krsnas tu bhagavan svayam. The original source
of all energies, or the summum bonum, is the Absolute Truth, which is called Parambrahma, etc., and
Bhagavan is the last word of the Absolute Truth. But even with the synonyms for Bhagavan, such as
Narayana, Visnu and Purusa, the last word is Krsna, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita: aham sarvasya
prabhavo mattah samam pravartate, etc. Besides that, the Srimad-Bhagavatam is the representation of Lord
Krsna as a sound incarnation of the Lord.
krsne sva-dhamopagate
dharma-jnanadibhih saha
kalau nasta-drsam esah
puranarko 'dhunoditah
(Bhag. 1.3.43)
Thus by general conclusion Lord Krsna is the ultimate source of all energies, and the word Krsna means
that. And to explain Krsna or the science of Krsna, the Srimad-Bhagavatam has been prepared. In the First
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam this truth is indicated in the questions and answers by Suta Gosvami and
great sages like Saunaka, and in the First and Second Chapters of the canto this is explained. In the Third
Chapter this subject is more explicit, and in the Fourth Chapter even more explicit. In the Second Canto
the Absolute Truth as the personality of Godhead is further emphasized, and the indication is the
Supreme Lord Krsna. The summary of Srimad-Bhagavatam in four verses, as we have already discussed, is
succinct. This Supreme Personality of Godhead in the ultimate issue is confirmed by Brahma in his
Brahma-samhita as isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah. So it is concluded in the Third
Canto of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The complete subject matter is elaborately explained in the Tenth and
Eleventh Cantos of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. In the matter of the changes of the Manus or manvantaras,
such as the Svayambhuva-manvantara and Caksusa-manvantara, as they are discussed in the Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Cantos of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Lord Krsna is indicated. In the Eighth
Canto the Vaivasvata-manvantara explains the same subject indirectly, and in the Ninth Canto the same
purport is there. In the Twelfth Canto the same is further explained, specifically regarding the different
incarnations of the Lord. Thus it is concluded by studying the complete Srimad-Bhagavatam that Lord Sri
Krsna is the ultimate summum bonum, or the ultimate source of all energy. And according to the grades
of worshipers, the indications of the nomenclature may be differently explained as Narayana, Brahma,
Paramatma, etc.
