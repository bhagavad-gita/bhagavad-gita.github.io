svadhisnyam asthaya vimrsya tad-dhitam
tapasy upadista ivadadhe manah
SYNONYMS
nisamya--after hearing; tat--that; vaktr--the speaker; didrksaya--just to find out who spoke; disah--all
sides; vilokya--seeing; tatra--there; anyat--any other; apasyamanah--not to be found; svadhisnyam--on his

he was instructed; iva--in pursuance of; adadhe--gave; manah--attention.
TRANSLATION
When he heard the sound, he tried to find the speaker, searching on all sides. But when he was unable
to find anyone besides himself, he thought it wise to sit down on his lotus seat firmly and give his
attention to the execution of penance, as he was instructed.
PURPORT
To achieve success in life, one should follow the example of Lord Brahma, the first living creature in the
beginning of creation. After being initiated by the Supreme Lord to execute tapasya, he was fixed in his
determination to do it, and although he could not find anyone besides himself, he could rightly
understand that the sound was transmitted by the Lord Himself. Brahma was the only living being at that
time because there was no other creation and none could be found there except himself. In the beginning
of the First Canto, in the First Chapter, first verse, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, it has already been
mentioned that Brahma was initiated by the Lord from within. The Lord is within every living entity as
the Supersoul, and He initiated Brahma because Brahma was willing to receive the initiation. The Lord can
similarly initiate everyone who is inclined to have it.
As already stated, Brahma is the original spiritual master for the universe, and since he was initiated by
the Lord Himself, the message of Srimad-Bhagavatam is coming down by disciplic succession, and in
order to receive the real message of Srimad-Bhagavatam one should approach the current link, or spiritual
master, in the chain of disciplic succession. After being initiated by the proper spiritual master in that
chain of succession, one should engage himself in the discharge of tapasya in the execution of devotional
service. One should not, however, think himself on the level of Brahma to be initiated directly by the Lord
from inside because in the present age no one can be accepted to be as pure as Brahma. The post of
Brahma to officiate in the creation of the universe is offered to the most pure living being, and unless one
is so qualified one cannot expect to be treated like Brahmaji directly. But one can have the same facility
through unalloyed devotees of the Lord, through scriptural instructions (as revealed in the Bhagavad-gita
and Srimad-Bhagavatam especially), and also through the bona fide spiritual master available to the
sincere soul. The Lord Himself appears as the spiritual master to a person who is sincere in heart about
serving the Lord. Therefore the bona fide spiritual master who happens to meet the sincere devotee
should be accepted as the most confidential and beloved representative of the Lord. If a person is posted
under the guidance of such a bona fide spiritual master, it may be accepted without any doubt that the
desiring person has achieved the grace of the Lord.
