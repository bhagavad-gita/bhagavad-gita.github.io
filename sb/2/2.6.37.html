<h2>Translation</h2>
Since neither Lord Siva nor you nor I could ascertain the limits of spiritual happiness, how can other
demigods know it? And because all of us are bewildered by the illusory external energy of the Supreme
Lord, we can see only this manifested cosmos according to our individual ability.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We have many times mentioned the names of twelve selected authorities (dvadasa-mahajana), of which
Brahma, Narada and Lord Siva head the list as the first, second and third in order of merit of those who
know something of the Supreme Lord. Other demigods, semi-demigods, Gandharvas, Caranas,
Vidyadharas, human beings or asuras cannot possibly know fully about the potencies of the Absolute
Lord, Sri Krsna. The demigods, semi-demigods, Gandharvas, etc., are all highly intelligent persons in the
upper planets, the human beings are inhabitants of the intermediate planets, and the asuras are
inhabitants of the lower planets. All of them have their respective conceptions and estimations of the
Absolute Truth, as does the scientist or the empiric philosopher in human society. All such living entities
are creatures of the material nature, and consequently they are bewildered by the wonderful display of the
three modes of material nature. Such bewilderment is mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita (7.13). Tribhir
gunamayair bhavair ebhih samam idam jagat: every entity, beginning from Brahma down to the ant, is
individually bewildered by the three modes of material nature, namely goodness, passion and ignorance.
Everyone thinks, in terms of individual capacity, that this universe, which is manifested before us, is all in
all. And so the scientist in the human society of the twentieth century calculates the beginning and end of
the universe in his own way. But what can the scientists know? Even Brahma himself was once
bewildered, thinking himself the only one Brahma favored by the Lord, but later on, by the grace of the
Lord, he came to know that there are innumerable more powerful Brahmas as well, in far bigger universes
beyond this universe, and all of these universes combined together form ekapad-vibhuti, or one fourth of
the manifestation of the Lord's creative energy. The other three fourths of His energy are displayed in the
spiritual world, and so what can the tiny scientist with a tiny brain know of the Absolute Personality of
Godhead, Lord Krsna? The Lord says, therefore, mohitam nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam:
bewildered by such modes of material nature, they cannot understand that beyond these manifestations is
a Supreme Person who is the absolute controller of everything. Brahma, Narada and Lord Siva know about
the Lord to a considerable extent, and therefore one should follow the instructions of these great
personalities instead of being satisfied with a tiny brain and its playful discoveries such as spacecraft and
similar products of science. As the mother is the only authority to identify the father of a child, so the
mother Vedas, presented by the recognized authority such as Brahma, Narada or Siva, is the only
authority to inform us about the Absolute Truth.
