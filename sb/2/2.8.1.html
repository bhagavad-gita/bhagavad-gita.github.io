<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
King Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: How did Narada Muni, whose hearers are as fortunate
as those instructed by Lord Brahma, explain the transcendental qualities of the Lord, who is without
material qualities, and before whom did he speak?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devarsi Narada was directly instructed by Brahmaji, who was also directly instructed by the Supreme
Lord; therefore the instructions imparted by Narada to his various disciples are as good as those of the
Supreme Lord. That is the way of understanding Vedic knowledge. It comes down from the Lord by
disciplic succession, and this transcendental knowledge is distributed to the world by this descending
process. There is no chance, however, to receive the Vedic knowledge from mental speculators. Therefore,
wherever Narada Muni goes, he represents himself as authorized by the Lord, and his appearance is as
good as that of the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the disciplic succession which strictly follows the
transcendental instruction is the bona fide chain of disciplic succession, and the test for such bona fide
spiritual masters is that there should be no difference between the instruction of the Lord originally
imparted to His devotee and that which is imparted by the authority in the line of disciplic succession.
How Narada Muni distributed the transcendental knowledge of the Lord will be explained in later cantos.
It will appear also that the Lord existed prior to the material creation, and therefore His transcendental
name, quality, etc., do not represent any material quality. Whenever, therefore, the Lord is described as
aguna, or without any quality, it does not mean that He has no quality, but that He has no material
quality, such as the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, as the conditioned souls have. He is
transcendental to all material conceptions, and thus He is described as aguna.
