TRANSLATION
Are there no torn clothes lying on the common road? Do the trees, which exist for maintaining others,
no longer give alms in charity? Do the rivers, being dried up, no longer supply water to the thirsty? Are
the caves of the mountains now closed, or, above all, does the Almighty Lord not protect the fully
surrendered souls? Why then do the learned sages go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-earned
wealth?
PURPORT
The renounced order of life is never meant for begging or living at the cost of others as a parasite.
According to the dictionary, a parasite is a sycophant who lives at the cost of society without making any
contribution to that society. The renounced order is meant for contributing something substantial to
society and not depending on the earnings of the householders. On the contrary, acceptance of alms from
the householders by the bona fide mendicant is an opportunity afforded by the saint for the tangible
benefit of the donor. In the sanatana-dharma institution, alms-giving to the mendicant is part of a
householder's duty, and it is advised in the scriptures that the householders should treat the mendicants
as their family children and should provide them with food, clothing, etc., without being asked.
Pseudomendicants, therefore, should not take advantage of the charitable disposition of the faithful
householders. The first duty of a person in the renounced order of life is to contribute some literary work
for the benefit of the human being in order to give him realized direction toward self-realization. Amongst
the other duties in the renounced order of life of Srila Sanatana, Srila Rupa and the other Gosvamis of
Vrndavana, the foremost duty discharged by them was to hold learned discourses amongst themselves at
Sevakunja, Vrndavana (the spot where Sri Radha-Damodara Temple was established by Srila Jiva Gosvami
and where the actual samadhi tombs of Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Jiva Gosvami are laid). For the
benefit of all in human society, they left behind them immense literatures of transcendental importance.
Similarly, all the acaryas who voluntarily accepted the renounced order of life aimed at benefiting human
society and not at living a comfortable or irresponsible life at the cost of others. However, those who
cannot give any contribution should not go to the householders for food, for such mendicants asking
bread from the householders are an insult to the highest order. Sukadeva Gosvami gave this warning
especially for those mendicants who adopt this line of profession to solve their economic problems. Such
mendicants are in abundance in the age of Kali. When a man becomes a mendicant willfully or by
circumstances, he must be of firm faith and conviction that the Supreme Lord is the maintainer of all
living beings everywhere in the universe. Why, then, would He neglect the maintenance of a surrendered
soul who is cent percent engaged in the service of the Lord? A common master looks to the necessities of
his servant, so how much more would the all-powerful, all-opulent Supreme Lord look after the
necessities of life for a fully surrendered soul. The general rule is that a mendicant devotee will accept a
simple small loincloth without asking anyone to give it in charity. He simply salvages it from the rejected
torn cloth thrown in the street. When he is hungry he may go to a magnanimous tree which drops fruits,
and when he is thirsty he may drink water from the flowing river. He does not require to live in a
comfortable house, but should find a cave in the hills and not be afraid of jungle animals, keeping faith in
God, who lives in everyone's heart. The Lord may dictate to tigers and other jungle animals not to disturb
His devotee. Haridasa Thakura, a great devotee of Lord Sri Caitanya, used to live in such a cave, and by
chance a great venomous snake was a co-partner of the cave. Some admirer of Thakura Haridasa who had
to visit the Thakura every day feared the snake and suggested that the Thakura leave that place. Because
his devotees were afraid of the snake and they were regularly visiting the cave, Thakura Haridasa agreed
to the proposal on their account. But as soon as this was settled, the snake actually crawled out of its hole
in the cave and left the cave for good before everyone present. By the dictation of the Lord, who lived also
within the heart of the snake, the snake gave preference to Haridasa and decided to leave the place and
not disturb him. So this is a tangible example of how the Lord gives protection to a bona fide devotee like
Thakura Haridasa. According to the regulations of the sanatana-dharma institution, one is trained from
the beginning to depend fully on the protection of the Lord in all circumstances. The path of renunciation
is recommended for acceptance by one who is fully accomplished and fully purified in his existence. This
stage is described also in the Bhagavad-gita (16.5) as daivi sampat. A human being is required to
accumulate daivi sampat, or spiritual assets; otherwise, the next alternative, asuri sampat, or material
assets, will overcome him disproportionately, and thus one will be forced into the entanglement of
different miseries of the material world. A sannyasi should always live alone, without company, and he
must be fearless. He should never be afraid of living alone, although he is never alone. The Lord is
residing in everyone's heart, and unless one is purified by the prescribed process, one will feel that he is
alone. But a man in the renounced order of life must be purified by the process; thus he will feel the
presence of the Lord everywhere and will have nothing to fear (such as being without any company).
Everyone can become a fearless and honest person if his very existence is purified by discharging the
prescribed duty for each and every order of life. One can become fixed in one's prescribed duty by faithful
aural reception of Vedic instructions and assimilation of the essence of Vedic knowledge by devotional
service to the Lord.
