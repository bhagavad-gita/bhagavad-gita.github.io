<h2>Translation</h2>
Because the sky is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch, and by previous
succession the air is also full of sound and the basic principles of duration of life: sense perception, mental
power and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is
generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a
manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of
sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as
previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The whole process of creation is an act of gradual evolution and development from one element to
another, reaching up to the variegatedness of the earth as so many trees, plants, mountains, rivers,
reptiles, birds, animals and varieties of human beings. The quality of sense perception is also evolutionary,
namely generated from sound, then touch, and from touch to form. Taste and odor are also generated
along with the gradual development of sky, air, fire, water and earth. They are all mutually the cause and
effect of one another, but the original cause is the Lord Himself in plenary portion, as Maha-Visnu lying in
the causal water of the mahat-tattva. As such, Lord Krsna is described in the Brahma-samhita as the cause
of all causes, and this is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (10.8) as follows:
aham sarvasya prabhavo
mattah sarvam pravartate
iti matva bhajante mam
budha bhava-samanvitah
The qualities of sense perception are fully represented in the earth, and they are manifested in other
elements to a lesser extent. In the sky there is sound only, whereas in the air there are sound and touch.
In the fire there are sound, touch and shape, and in the water there is taste also, along with the other
perceptions, namely sound, touch and shape. In the earth, however, there are all the above-mentioned
qualities with an extra development of odor also. Therefore on the earth there is a full display of
variegatedness of life, which is originally started with the basic principle of air. Diseases of the body take
place due to derangement of air within the earthly body of the living beings. Mental diseases result from
special derangement of the air within the body, and as such, yogic exercise is especially beneficial to keep
the air in order so that diseases of the body become almost nil by such exercises. When they are properly
done the duration of life also increases, and one can have control over death also by such practices. A
perfect yogi can have command over death and quit the body at the right moment, when he is competent
to transfer himself to a suitable planet. The bhakti-yogi, however, surpasses all the yogis because, by dint
of his devotional service, he is promoted to the region beyond the material sky and is placed in one of the
planets in the spiritual sky by the supreme will of the Lord, the controller of everything.
