<h2>Text</h2>
bahavo loka-palanam
prayasah ksema-karmanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bahavah--arms; loka-palanam--of the governing deities of the planets, the demigods; prayasah--almost

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's arms are the productive fields for the great demigods and other leaders of the living entities
who protect the general mass.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This important verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam is corroborated and nicely explained in the Bhagavad-gita
(10.41-42) as follows:
yad yad vibhutimat sattvam
srimad urjitam eva va
tat tad evavagaccha tvam
mama tejo-'msa-sambhavam
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
There are many powerful kings, leaders, learned scholars, scientists, artists, engineers, inventors,
excavators, archaeologists, industrialists, politicians, economists, business magnates, and many more
powerful deities or demigods like Brahma, Siva, Indra, Candra, Surya, Varuna and Marut, who are all
protecting the interest of the universal affairs of maintenance, in different positions, and all of them are
different powerful parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna is the father of all
living entities, who are placed in different high and low positions according to their desires or aspirations.
Some of them, as particularly mentioned above, are specifically endowed with powers by the will of the
Lord. A sane person must know for certain that a living being, however powerful he may be, is neither
absolute nor independent. All living beings must accept the origin of their specific power as mentioned in
this verse. And if they act accordingly, then simply by discharging their respective occupational duties
they can achieve the highest perfection of life, namely eternal life, complete knowledge and inexhaustible
blessings. As long as the powerful men of the world do not accept the origin of their respective powers,
namely the Personality of Godhead, the actions of maya (illusion) will continue to act. The actions of
maya are such that a powerful person, misled by the illusory, material energy, wrongly accepts himself as
all in all and does not develop God consciousness. As such, the false sense of egoism (namely myself and
mine) has become overly prominent in the world, and there is a hard struggle for existence in human
society. The intelligent class of men, therefore, must admit the Lord as the ultimate source of all energies
and thus pay tribute to the Lord for His good blessings. Simply by accepting the Lord as the supreme
proprietor of everything, since He is actually so, one can achieve the highest perfection of life. Whatever a
person may be in the estimation of the social order of things, if a person tries to reciprocate a feeling of
love towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is satisfied with the blessings of the Lord, he will at
once feel the highest peace of mind for which he is hankering life after life. Peace of mind, or in other
words the healthy state of mind, can be achieved only when the mind is situated in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord. The parts and parcels of the Lord are endowed with specific powers for
rendering service unto the Lord, just as a big business magnate's sons are empowered with specific powers
of administration. The obedient son of the father never goes against the will of the father and therefore
passes life very peacefully in concurrence with the head of the family, the father. Similarly, the Lord being
the father, all living beings should fully and satisfactorily discharge the duty and will of the father, as
faithful sons. This very mentality will at once bring peace and prosperity to human society.
