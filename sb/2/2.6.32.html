<h2>Text</h2>
srjami tan-niyukto 'ham
haro harati tad-vasah
visvam purusa-rupena
paripati tri-sakti-dhrk
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
srjami--do create; tat--by His; niyuktah--appointment; aham--I; harah--Lord Siva; harati--destroys; tatvasah--
under His subordination; visvam--the whole universe; purusa--the Personality of Godhead;
rupena--by His eternal form; paripati--maintains; tri-sakti-dhrk--the controller of three energies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By His will, I create, Lord Siva destroys, and He Himself, in His eternal form as the Personality of
Godhead, maintains everything. He is the powerful controller of these three energies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conception of one without a second is clearly confirmed here. The one is Lord Vasudeva, and only
by His different energies and expansions are different manifestations, both in the material and in the
spiritual worlds, maintained. In the material world also, Lord Vasudeva is everything, as stated in the
Bhagavad-gita (7.19). Vasudevah sarvam iti: everything is Vasudeva only. In the Vedic hymns also the
same Vasudeva is held to be supreme. It is said in the Vedas, vasudevat paro brahman na canyo 'rtho 'sti
tattvatah: in fact there is no greater truth than Vasudeva. And Lord Krsna affirms the same truth in the
Bhagavad-gita (7.7). Mattah parataram nanyat: "There is nothing above Me [Lord Krsna]." So the
conception of oneness, as overly stressed by the impersonalist, is also accepted by the personalist devotee
of the Lord. The difference is that the impersonalist denies personality in the ultimate issue, whereas the
devotee gives more importance to the Personality of Godhead. Srimad-Bhagavatam explains this truth in
the verse under discussion: Lord Vasudeva is one without a second, but because He is all-powerful, He
can expand Himself as well as display His omnipotencies. The Lord is described here as omnipotent by
three energies (tri-sakti-dhrk). So primarily His three energies are internal, marginal and external. This
external energy is also displayed in the three modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Similarly, the
internal potency is also displayed in three spiritual modes--samvit, sandhini and hladini. The marginal
potency, or the living entities, is also spiritual (prakrtim viddhi me param), but the living entities are
never equal to the Lord. The Lord is nirasta-samya-atisaya; in other words, no one is greater than or equal
to the Supreme Lord. So the living entities, including even such great personalities as Lord Brahma and
Lord Siva, are all subordinate to the Lord. In the material world also, in His eternal form of Visnu, He
maintains and controls all the affairs of the demigods, including Brahma and Siva.
