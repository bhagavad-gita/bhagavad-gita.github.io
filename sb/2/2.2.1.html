sri-suka uvaca
variyan esa te prasnah
krto loka-hitam nrpa
atmavit-sammatah pumsam
srotavyadisu yah parah
SYNONYMS
sri-sukah uvaca--Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; variyan--glorious; esah--this; te--your; prasnah--question;
krtah--made by you; loka-hitam--beneficial for all men; nrpa--O King; atmavit--transcendentalist;
sammatah--approved; pumsam--of all men; srotavya-adisu--in all kinds of hearing; yah--what is; parah--
the supreme.
TRANSLATION
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial to all
kinds of people. The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by
all transcendentalists.
PURPORT
Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing. Simply by such
questioning and hearing, one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life. Because Lord Krsna is the
original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu
said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of Krsna. Because
questions and answers about Krsna elevate one to that transcendental position, the questions of Maharaja
Pariksit about Krsna philosophy are greatly glorified. Maharaja Pariksit wanted to absorb his mind
completely in Krsna, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon
activities of Krsna. For instance, in the Bhagavad-gita it is stated that simply by understanding the
transcendental nature of Lord Krsna's appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately
return home, back to Godhead, and never come back to this miserable condition of material existence. It
is very auspicious, therefore, to hear always about Krsna. So Maharaja Pariksit requested Sukadeva
Gosvami to narrate the activities of Krsna so that he could engage his mind in Krsna. The activities of
Krsna are nondifferent from Krsna Himself. As long as one is engaged in hearing such transcendental
activities of Krsna, he remains aloof from the conditional life of material existence. The topics of Lord
Krsna are so auspicious that they purify the speaker, the hearer and the inquirer. They are compared to
the Ganges waters, which flow from the toe of Lord Krsna. Wherever the Ganges waters go, they purify
the land and the person who bathes in them. Similarly, krsna-katha, or the topics of Krsna, are so pure
that wherever they are spoken, the place, the hearer, the inquirer, the speaker and all concerned become
purified.
