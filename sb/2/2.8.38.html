TRANSLATION
Thereafter, at the end of Kali-yuga, when there exist no topics on the subject of God, even at the
residences of so-called saints and respectable gentlemen of the three higher castes, and when the power of
government is transferred to the hands of ministers elected from the lowborn sudra class or those less
than them, and when nothing is known of the techniques of sacrifice, even by word, at that time the Lord
will appear as the supreme chastiser.
PURPORT
The symptoms of the worst conditions of the material world, at the last stage of this age, called Kaliyuga,
are stated herein. The sum and substance of such conditions is godlessness. Even the so-called
saints and higher castes of the social orders, generally known as the dvija janas or the twice-born, will
become atheists. As such, all of them will practically forget even the holy name of the Lord, and what to
speak of His activities. The higher castes of society, namely the intelligent class of men guiding the
destinies of the social orders, the administrative class of men guiding the law and order of the society, and
the productive class of men guiding the economic development of the society, must all be properly well
versed in knowledge of the Supreme Lord, knowing factually His name, quality, pastimes, entourage,
paraphernalia and personalities. The saints and the higher castes or orders of the society are judged by
their proportion of knowledge in the science of God, or tattva jnana, and not by any kind of birthright or
bodily designations. Such designations, without any knowledge of the science of God and practical
knowledge of devotional service, are considered to be all decorations of dead bodies. And when there is
too much inflation of these decorated dead bodies in society, there develop so many anomalies in the
progressive, peaceful life of the human being. Because of the lack of training or culture in the upper
section of the social orders, they are no more to be designated as the dvija janas, or the twice-born. The
significance of being twice-born has been explained in many places in these great literatures, and again
one is reminded herewith that birth, executed by the sex life of the father and the mother, is called animal
birth. But such animal birth and progress of life on the animal principles of eating, sleeping, fearing and
mating (without any scientific culture of spiritual life) is called the sudra life, or, to be more explicit, the
uncultured life of the lower class of men. It is stated herein that the governmental power of society in the
Kali-yuga will be passed over to the uncultured, godless laborer classes of men, and thus the nrdevas (or
the ministers of the government) will be the vrsalas, or the uncultured lower-class men of society. No one
can expect any peace and prosperity in a human society full of uncultured lower classes of men. The
symptoms of such uncultured social animals are already in vogue, and it is the duty of the leaders of men
to take note of it and try to reform the social order by introducing the principles of twice-born men
trained in the science of God consciousness. This can be done by expanding the culture of Srimad-
Bhagavatam all over the world. In the degraded condition of human society, the Lord incarnates as the
Kalki avatara and kills all the demonic without mercy.
