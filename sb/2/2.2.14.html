<h2>Translation</h2>
Unless the gross materialist develops a sense of loving service unto the Supreme Lord, the seer of both
the transcendental and material worlds, he should remember or meditate upon the universal form of the
Lord at the end of his prescribed duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord is the seer of all worlds, both material and transcendental. In other words, the
Supreme Lord is the ultimate beneficiary and enjoyer of all worlds, as confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita
(5.29). The spiritual world is the manifestation of His internal potency, and the material world is the
manifestation of His external potency. The living entities are also His marginal potency, and by their own
choice they can live in either the transcendental or material worlds. The material world is not a fit place
for living entities because they are spiritually one with the Lord and in the material world the living
entities become conditioned by the laws of the material world. The Lord wants all living entities, who are
His parts and parcels, to live with Him in the transcendental world, and for enlightening conditioned
souls in the material world, all the Vedas and the revealed scriptures are there--expressly to recall the
conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead. Unfortunately, the conditioned living entities, although
suffering continually the threefold miseries of conditioned life, are not very serious about going back to
Godhead. It is due to their misguided way of living, complicated by sins and virtues. Some of them who
are virtuous by deeds begin to reestablish the lost relation with the Lord, but they are unable to
understand the personal feature of the Lord. The real purpose of life is to make contact with the Lord and
be engaged in His service. That is the natural position of living entities. But those who are impersonalists
and are unable to render any loving service to the Lord have been advised to meditate upon His
impersonal feature, the virat-rupa, or universal form. Some way or other, one must try to reestablish one's
forgotten relation with the Lord if one at all desires to gain real happiness in life, and to reclaim his
natural unfettered condition. For the less intelligent beginners, meditation on the impersonal feature, the
virat-rupa, or universal form of the Lord, will gradually qualify one to rise to personal contact. One is
advised herewith to meditate upon the virat-rupa specified in the previous chapters in order to
understand how the different planets, seas, mountains, rivers, birds, beasts, human beings, demigods and
all that we can conceive are but different parts and limbs of the Lord's virat form. This sort of thinking is
also a type of meditation on the Absolute Truth, and as soon as such meditation begins, one develops
one's godly qualities, and the whole world appears to be a happy and peaceful residence for all the people
of the world. Without such meditation on God, either personal or impersonal, all good qualities of the
human being become covered with misconceptions regarding his constitutional position, and without
such advanced knowledge, the whole world becomes a hell for the human being.
