<h2>Translation</h2>
One should concentrate his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who alone distributes
Himself in so many manifestations just as ordinary persons create thousands of manifestations in dreams.
One must concentrate the mind on Him, the only all-blissful Absolute Truth. Otherwise one will be
misled and will cause his own degradation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, the process of devotional service is indicated by the great Gosvami, Srila Sukadeva. He
tries to impress upon us that instead of diverting our attention to several branches of self-realization, we
should concentrate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme object of realization,
worship and devotion. Self-realization is, as it were, offering a fight for eternal life against the material
struggle for existence, and therefore by the illusory grace of the external energy, the yogi or the devotee is
faced with many allurements which can entangle a great fighter again in the bondage of material
existence. A yogi can attain miraculous successes in material achievements, such as anima and laghima,
by which one can become more minute than the minutest or lighter than the lightest, or in the ordinary
sense, one may achieve material benedictions in the shape of wealth and women. But one is warned
against such allurements because entanglement again in such illusory pleasure means degradation of the
self and further imprisonment in the material world. By this warning, one should follow one's vigilant
intelligence only.
The Supreme Lord is one, and His expansions are various. He is therefore the Supersoul of everything.
When a man sees anything, he must know that his seeing is secondary and the Lord's seeing is primary.
One cannot see anything without the Lord's having first seen it. That is the instruction of the Vedas and
the Upanisads. So whatever we see or do, the Supersoul of all acts of seeing or doing is the Lord. This
theory of simultaneous oneness and difference between the individual soul and the Supersoul is
propounded by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. The viratrupa,
or the gigantic feature of the Supreme Lord, includes everything materially manifested, and
therefore the virat or gigantic feature of the Lord is the Supersoul of all living and nonliving entities. But
the virat-rupa is also the manifestation of Narayana or Visnu, and going further on and on one will
eventually see that Lord Krsna is the ultimate Supersoul of everything that be. The conclusion is that one
should unhesitatingly become a worshiper of Lord Krsna, or, for that matter, His plenary expansion
Narayana, and none else. In the Vedic hymns, it is clearly said that first of all Narayana cast a glance over
matter and thus there was creation. Before creation, there was neither Brahma nor Siva, and what to speak
of others. Sripada Sankaracarya has definitely accepted this, that Narayana is beyond the material creation
and that all others are within the material creation. The whole material creation, therefore, is one with
and different from Narayana, simultaneously, and this supports the acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philosophy
of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Being an emanation from the glancing potency of Narayana, the whole
material creation is nondifferent from Him. But because it is the effect of His external energy (bahiranga
maya) and is aloof from the internal potency (atma-maya), the whole material creation is different from
Him at the same time. The example given in this verse very nicely is that of the dreaming man. The
dreaming man creates many things in his dream, and thus he himself becomes the entangled seer of the
dream and is also affected by the consequences. This material creation is also exactly a dreamlike creation
of the Lord, but He, being the transcendental Supersoul, is neither entangled nor affected by the reactions
of such a dreamlike creation. He is always in His transcendental position, but essentially He is everything,
and nothing is apart from Him. As a part of Him, one should therefore concentrate on Him only, without
deviation; otherwise one is sure to be overcome by the potencies of the material creation, one after
another. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (9.7) as follows:
sarva-bhutani kaunteya
prakrtim yanti mamikam
kalpa-ksaye punas tani
kalpadau visrjamy aham
"O son of Kunti, at the end of the millennium every material manifestation enters into My nature, and at
the beginning of another millennium, by My potency, I again create."
The human life, however, is an opportunity to get out of this repetition of creation and annihilation. It
is a means whereby one may escape the Lord's external potency and enter into His internal potency.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The First Step in God Realization."
