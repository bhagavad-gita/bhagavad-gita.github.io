<h2>Text</h2>
yasmad andam virad jajne
bhutendriya-gunatmakah
tad dravyam atyagad visvam
gobhih surya ivatapan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yasmat--from whom; andam--the universal globes; virat--and the gigantic universal form; jajne--
appeared; bhuta--elements; indriya--senses; guna-atmakah--qualitative; tat dravyam--the universes and the
universal form, etc.; atyagat--surpassed; visvam--all the universes; gobhih--by the rays; suryah--the sun;
iva--like; atapan--distributed rays and heat.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
From that Personality of Godhead, all the universal globes and the universal form with all material
elements, qualities and senses are generated. Yet He is aloof from such material manifestations, like the
sun, which is separate from its rays and heat.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The supreme truth has been ascertained in the previous verse as purusa or the purusottama, the
Supreme person. The Absolute person is the isvara, or the supreme controller, by His different energies.
The ekapad-vibhuti manifestation of the material energy of the Lord is just like one of the many
mistresses of the Lord, by whom the Lord is not so much attracted, as indicated in the language of the
Gita (bhinna prakrtih). But the region of the tripad-vibhuti, being a pure spiritual manifestation of the
energy of the Lord, is, so to speak, more attractive to Him. The Lord, therefore, generates the material
manifestations by impregnating the material energy, and then, within the manifestation, He expands
Himself as the gigantic form of the visva-rupa. The visva-rupa, as it was shown to Arjuna, is not the
original form of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is the transcendental form of Purusottama, or
Krsna Himself. It is very nicely explained herein that He expands Himself just like the sun. The sun
expands itself by its terrible heat and rays, yet the sun is always aloof from such rays and heat. The
impersonalist takes into consideration the rays of the Lord without any information of the tangible,
transcendental, eternal form of the Lord, known as Krsna. Therefore Krsna, in His supreme personal form,
with two hands and flute, is bewildering for the impersonalists who can accommodate only the gigantic
visva-rupa of the Lord. They should know that the rays of the sun are secondary to the sun, and similarly
the impersonal gigantic form of the Lord is also secondary to the personal form as Purusottama. The
Brahma-samhita (5.37) confirms this statement as follows:
ananda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhavitabhis
tabhir ya eva nija-rupataya kalabhih
goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhuto
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, the one who enlivens the senses of everyone by His
personal bodily rays, resides in His transcendental abode, called Goloka. Yet He is present in every nook
and corner of His creation by expansion of happy spiritual rays, equal in power to His personal potency of
bliss." He is therefore simultaneously personal and impersonal by His inconceivable potency, or He is the
one without a second, displaying complete unity in a diversity of material and spiritual manifestations. He
is separate from everything, and still nothing is different from Him.
