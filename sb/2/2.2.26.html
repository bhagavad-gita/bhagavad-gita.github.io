<h2>Translation</h2>
At the time of the final devastation of the complete universe [the end of the duration of Brahma's life], a
flame of fire emanates from the mouth of Ananta [from the bottom of the universe]. The yogi sees all the
planets of the universe burning to ashes, and thus he leaves for Satyaloka by airplanes used by the great
purified souls. The duration of life in Satyaloka is calculated to be 15,480,000,000,000 years.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is indicated herein that the residents of Maharloka, where the purified living entities or demigods
possess a duration of life calculated to be 4,300,000,000 solar years, have airships by which they reach
Satyaloka, the topmost planet of the universe. In other words, the Srimad-Bhagavatam gives us many clues
about other planets far, far away from us which modern planes and spacecraft cannot reach, even by
imaginary speeds. The statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam are accepted by great acaryas like Sridhara
Svami, Ramanujacarya and Vallabhacarya. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu specifically accepts Srimad-
Bhagavatam as the spotless Vedic authority, and as such no sane man can ignore the statements of Srimad-
Bhagavatam when it is spoken by the self-realized soul Srila Sukadeva Gosvami, who follows in the
footsteps of his great father, Srila Vyasadeva, the compiler of all Vedic literatures. In the creation of the
Lord there are many wonderful things we can see with our own eyes every day and night, but we are
unable to reach them equipped by modern materialistic science. We should not, therefore, depend on the
fragmentary authority of materialistic science for knowing things beyond the range of scientific purview.
For a common man, both modern science and Vedic wisdom are simply to be accepted because none of
the statements either of modern science or of Vedic literature can be verified by him. The alternative for a
common man is to believe either of them or both of them. The Vedic way of understanding, however, is
more authentic because it has been accepted by the acaryas, who are not only faithful and learned men,
but are also liberated souls without any of the flaws of conditioned souls. The modern scientists, however,
are conditioned souls liable to so many errors and mistakes; therefore the safe side is to accept the
authentic version of Vedic literatures, like Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is accepted unanimously by the
great acaryas.
