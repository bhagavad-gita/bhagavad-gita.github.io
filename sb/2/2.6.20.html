<h2>Translation</h2>
The spiritual world, which consists of three fourths of the Lord's energy, is situated beyond this material
world, and it is especially meant for those who will never be reborn. Others, who are attached to family
life and who do not strictly follow celibacy vows, must live within the three material worlds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The climax of the system of varnasrama-dharma, or sanatana-dharma, is clearly expressed here in this
particular verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The highest benefit that can be awarded to a human being is to
train him to be detached from sex life, particularly because it is only due to sex indulgence that the
conditioned life of material existence continues birth after birth. Human civilization in which there is no
control of sex life is a fourth-class civilization because in such an atmosphere there is no liberation of the
soul encaged in the material body. Birth, death, old age and disease are related to the material body, and
they have nothing to do with the spirit soul. But as long as the bodily attachment for sensual enjoyment is
encouraged, the individual spirit soul is forced to continue the repetition of birth and death on account of
the material body, which is compared to garments subjected to the law of deterioration.
In order to award the highest benefit of human life, the varnasrama system trains the follower to adopt
the vow of celibacy beginning from the order of brahmacari. The brahmacari life is for students who are
educated to follow strictly the vow of celibacy. Youngsters who have had no taste of sex life can easily
follow the vow of celibacy, and once fixed in the principle of such a life, one can very easily continue to
the highest perfectional stage, attaining the kingdom of the three-fourths energy of the Lord. It is already
explained that in the cosmos of three-fourths energy of the Lord there is neither death nor fear, and one is
full of the blissful life of happiness and knowledge. A householder attached to family life can easily give
up such a life of sex indulgence if he has been trained in the principles of the life of a brahmacari. A
householder is recommended to quit home at the end of fifty years (pancasordhvam vanam vrajet) and
live a life in the forest; then, being fully detached from family affection, he may accept the order of
renunciation as a sannyasi fully engaged in the service of the Lord. Any form of religious principles in
which the followers are trained to pursue the vow of celibacy is good for the human being because only
those who are trained in that way can end the miserable life of material existence. The principles of
nirvana, as recommended by Lord Buddha, are also meant for ending the miserable life of material
existence. And this process, in the highest degree, is recommended here in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, with
clear perception of ideal perfection, although basically there is no difference between the process of
Buddhists, Sankarites and Vaisnavites. For promotion to the highest status of perfection, namely freedom
from birth and death, anxiety and fearfulness, not one of these processes allows the follower to break the
vow of celibacy.
The householders and persons who have deliberately broken the vow of celibacy cannot enter into the
kingdom of deathlessness. The pious householders or the fallen yogis or the fallen transcendentalists can
be promoted to the higher planets within the material world (one fourth of the energy of the Lord), but
they will fail to enter into the kingdom of deathlessness. Abrhad-vratas are those who have broken the
vow of celibacy. The vanaprasthas, or those retired from family life, and the sannyasis, or the renounced
persons, cannot break the vow of celibacy if they want success in the process. The brahmacaris,
vanaprasthas and sannyasis do not intend to take rebirth (apraja), nor are they meant for secretly
indulging in sex life. Such a falldown by the spiritualist may be compensated by another chance for
human life in good families of learned brahmanas or of rich merchants for another term of elevation, but
the best thing is to attain the highest perfection of deathlessness as soon as the human form of life is
attained; otherwise the whole policy of human life will prove to be a total failure. Lord Caitanya was very
strict in advising His followers in this matter of celibacy. One of His personal attendants, Chota Haridasa,
was severely punished by Lord Caitanya because of his failure to observe the vow of celibacy. For a
transcendentalist, therefore, who at all wants to be promoted to the kingdom beyond material miseries, it
is worse than suicide to deliberately indulge in sex life, especially in the renounced order of life. Sex life in
the renounced order of life is the most perverted form of religious life, and such a misguided person can
only be saved if, by chance, he meets a pure devotee.
