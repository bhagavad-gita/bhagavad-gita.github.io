<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead is pure, being free from all contaminations of material tinges. He is the
Absolute Truth and the embodiment of full and perfect knowledge. He is all-pervading, without beginning
or end, and without rival. O Narada, O great sage, the great thinkers can know Him when completely
freed from all material hankerings and when sheltered under undisturbed conditions of the senses.
Otherwise, by untenable arguments, all is distorted, and the Lord disappears from our sight.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is an estimation of the Lord apart from His transcendental activities in the temporary, material
creations. Mayavada philosophy tries to designate the Lord as contaminated by a material body when He
accepts forms of incarnation. This sort of interpolation is completely denied herein by the explanation
that the Lord's position is pure and unalloyed in all circumstances. According to Mayavada philosophy,
the spirit soul, when covered by nescience, is designated as jiva, but when freed from such ignorance or
nescience he merges in the impersonal existence of the Absolute Truth. But here it is said that the Lord is
eternally the symbol of full and perfect knowledge. This is His speciality: perpetual freedom from all
material contaminations. This distinguishes the Lord from the individual, common living entities who
have the aptitude for being subordinated by nescience and thus becoming materially designated. In the
Vedas it is said that the Lord is vijnanam anandam, full of bliss and knowledge. The conditioned souls are
never to be compared to Him because such individual souls have the tendency to become contaminated.
Although after liberation the living entity can become one with the same quality of existence as the Lord,
his very tendency to become contaminated, which the Lord never has, makes the individual living entity
different from the Lord. In the Vedas it is said, suddham apapa-viddham: the individual atma becomes
polluted by sin, but the Lord is never contaminated by sins. The Lord is compared to the powerful sun.
The sun is never contaminated by anything infectious because it is so powerful. On the contrary, infected
things are sterilized by the rays of the sun. Similarly, the Lord is never contaminated by sins; on the
contrary, the sinful living entities become sterilized by contact with the Lord. This means that the Lord is
also all-pervading like the sun, and as such the word pratyak is used in this verse. Nothing is excluded
from the existence of the Lord's potential expansions. The Lord is within everything, and He is allcovering
also, without being disturbed by the activities of the individual souls. He is therefore infinite,
and the living entities are infinitesimal. In the Vedas it is said that only the Lord alone exists, and all
others' existences depend on Him. He is the generating reservoir for everyone's existential capacity; He is
the Supreme Truth of all other categorical truths. He is the source of everyone's opulence, and therefore
no one can equal Him in opulence. Being full of all opulences, namely wealth, fame, strength, beauty,
knowledge and renunciation, certainly He is the Supreme Person. And because He is a person, He has
many personal qualities, although He is transcendental to the material modes. We have already discussed
the statement, ittham-bhuta-guno harih (Bhag. 1.7.10). His transcendental qualities are so attractive that
even the liberated souls (atmaramas) are also attracted by them. Although possessed of all personal
qualities, He is nevertheless omnipotent. Therefore, personally He has nothing to do, for everything is
being carried out by His omnipotent energies. This is confirmed by the Vedic mantras: parasya saktir
vividhaiva sruyate svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca. This suggests His specific spiritual form, which can
never be experienced by the material senses. He can be seen only when the senses are purified by
devotional service (yam evaisa vrnute tena labhyah). As such, there are basic differences between the Lord
and the living entities, in so many respects. No one can be compared to the Lord, as the Vedas declare
(ekam evadvitiyam brahma, dvaitad vai bhayam bhavati). The Lord has no competitor, and He has
nothing to fear from any other being, nor can anyone be equal to Him. Although He is the root of all other
beings, there are basic differences between Him and other beings. Otherwise there would have been no
necessity for the statement in the previous verse that no one can know Him one hundred percent as He is
(na yam vidanti tattvena). That no one can fully understand Him is explained also in this verse, but the
qualification for understanding to some degree is mentioned here. Only the prasantas, or the unalloyed
devotees of the Lord, can know Him to a greater extent. The reason is that the devotees have no demands
in their lives but to be obedient servants of the Lord, while all others, namely the empiric philosophers,
the mystics and the fruitive workers, all basically have some demand, and as such they cannot be pacified.
The fruitive worker wants reward for his work, the mystic wants some perfection of life, and the empiric
philosopher wants to merge in the existence of the Lord. Somehow or other, as long as there is a demand
for sense satisfaction, there is no chance for pacification; on the contrary, by unnecessary dry speculative
arguments, the whole matter becomes distorted, and thus the Lord moves still further away from our
understanding. The dry speculators, however, because of their following the principles of austerity and
penance, can have knowledge of the impersonal features of the Lord to some extent, but there is no
chance of their understanding His ultimate form as Govinda because only the amalatmanas, or the
completely sinless persons, can accept pure devotional service to the Lord, as confirmed in the Bhagavadgita
(7.28):
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
