<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
karya-karana-kartrtve
dravya-jnana-kriyasrayah
badhnanti nityada muktam
mayinam purusam gunah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
karya--effect; karana--cause; kartrtve--in activities; dravya--material; jnana--knowledge; kriya-asrayah--
manifested by such symptoms; badhnanti--conditions; nityada--eternally; muktam--transcendental;
mayinam--affected by material energy; purusam--the living entity; gunah--the material modes.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
These three modes of material nature, being further manifested as matter, knowledge and activities, put
the eternally transcendental living entity under conditions of cause and effect and make him responsible
for such activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because they are between the internal and external potencies, the eternally transcendental living entities
are called the marginal potency of the Lord. Factually, the living entities are not meant to be so
conditioned by material energy, but due to their being affected by the false sense of lording it over the
material energy, they come under the influence of such potency and thus become conditioned by the
three modes of material nature. This external energy of the Lord covers up the pure knowledge of the
living entity's eternally existing with Him, but the covering is so constant that it appears that the
conditioned soul is eternally ignorant. Such is the wonderful action of maya, or external energy
manifested as if materially produced. By the covering power of the material energy, the material scientist
cannot look beyond the material causes, but factually, behind the material manifestations, there are
adhibhuta, adhyatma and adhidaiva actions, which the conditioned soul in the mode of ignorance cannot
see. The adhibhuta manifestation entails repetitions of births and deaths with old age and diseases, the
adhyatma manifestation conditions the spirit soul, and the adhidaiva manifestation is the controlling
system. These are the material manifestations of cause and effect and the sense of responsibility of the
conditioned actors. They are, after all, manifestations of the conditioned state, and the human being's
freedom from such a conditioned state is the highest perfectional attainment.
