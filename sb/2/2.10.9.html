TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead, being thus very much satisfied with the penance of Lord Brahma, was
pleased to manifest His personal abode, Vaikuntha, the supreme planet above all others. This
transcendental abode of the Lord is adored by all self-realized persons freed from all kinds of miseries and
fear of illusory existence.
PURPORT
The troubles of penance accepted by Lord Brahma were certainly in the line of devotional service
(bhakti). Otherwise there was no chance that Vaikuntha or svalokam, the Lord's personal abodes, would
become visible to Brahmaji. The personal abodes of the Lord, known as Vaikunthas, are neither mythical
nor material, as conceived by the impersonalists. But realization of the transcendental abodes of the Lord
is possible only through devotional service, and thus the devotees enter into such abodes. There is
undoubtedly trouble in executing penance. But the trouble accepted in executing bhakti-yoga is
transcendental happiness from the very beginning, whereas the trouble of penance in other processes of
self-realization (jnana-yoga, dhyana-yoga, etc.), without any Vaikuntha realization, ends in trouble only
and nothing more. There is no profit in biting husks without grains. Similarly, there is no profit in
executing troublesome penances other than bhakti-yoga for self-realization.
Executing bhakti-yoga is exactly like sitting on the lotus sprouted out of the abdomen of the
transcendental Personality of Godhead, for Lord Brahma was seated there. Brahmaji was able to please the
Lord, and the Lord was also pleased to show Brahmaji His personal abode. Srila Jiva Gosvami, in the
comments of his Krama-sandarbha annotation of Srimad-Bhagavatam, cites quotations from the Garga
Upanisad Vedic evidence. It is said that Yajnavalkya described the transcendental abode of the Lord to
Gargi, and that the abode of the Lord is situated above the highest planet of the universe, namely
Brahmaloka. This abode of the Lord, although described in revealed scriptures like the Bhagavad-gita and
the Srimad-Bhagavatam, remains only a myth for the less intelligent class of men with a poor fund of
knowledge. Herein the word sva-drstavadbhih is very significant. One who has actually realized his self
realizes the transcendental form of one's self. Impersonal realization of self and the Supreme is not
complete, because it is just an opposite conception of material personalities. The Personality of Godhead
and the personalities of devotees of the Lord are all transcendental; they do not have material bodies. The
material body is overcast with five kinds of miserable conditions, namely ignorance, material conception,
attachment, hatred and absorption. As long as one is overwhelmed by those five kinds of material
miseries, there is no question of entering into the Vaikunthalokas. The impersonal conception of one's self
is just the negation of material personality and is far from the positive existence of personal form. The
personal forms of the transcendental abode will be explained in the following verses. Brahmaji also
described the highest planet of the Vaikunthaloka as Goloka Vrndavana, where the Lord resides as a
cowherd boy keeping transcendental surabhi cows and surrounded by hundreds and thousands of
goddesses of fortune.
cintamani-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vrksalaksavrtesu
surabhir abhipalayantam
laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
(Brahma-samhita 5.29)
The statement of the Bhagavad-gita, yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama, is also
confirmed herewith. param means transcendental Brahman. Therefore, the abode of the Lord is also
Brahman, nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is known as Vaikuntha, and
His abode is also known as Vaikuntha. Such Vaikuntha realization and worship can be made possible by
transcendental form and sense.
