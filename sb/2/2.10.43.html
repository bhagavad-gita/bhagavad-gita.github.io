tustam nisamya pitaram
lokanam prapitamaham
devarsih paripapraccha
bhavan yan manuprcchati
SYNONYMS
tustam--satisfied; nisamya--after seeing; pitaram--the father; lokanam--of the whole universe;
prapitamaham--the great-grandfather; devarsih--the great sage Narada; paripapraccha--inquired; bhavan--
yourself; yat--as it is; ma--from me; anuprcchati--inquiring.
TRANSLATION
The great sage Narada also inquired in detail from his father, Brahma, the great-grandfather of all the
universe, after seeing him well satisfied.
PURPORT
The process of understanding spiritual or transcendental knowledge from the realized person is not
exactly like asking an ordinary question from the schoolmaster. The schoolmasters in the modern days
are paid agents for giving some information, but the spiritual master is not a paid agent. Nor can he
impart instruction without being authorized. In the Bhagavad-gita (4.34), the process of understanding
transcendental knowledge is directed as follows:
tad viddhi pranipatena
pariprasnena sevaya
upadeksyanti te jnanam
jnaninas tattva-darsinah
Arjuna was advised to receive transcendental knowledge from the realized person by surrender,
questions and service. Receiving transcendental knowledge is not like exchanging dollars; such
knowledge has to be received by service to the spiritual master. As Brahmaji received the knowledge
directly from the Lord by satisfying Him fully, similarly one has to receive the transcendental knowledge
from the spiritual master by satisfying him. The spiritual master's satisfaction is the means of assimilating
transcendental knowledge. One cannot understand transcendental knowledge simply by becoming a
grammarian. The Vedas declare (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.23):
yasya deve para bhaktir
yatha deve tatha gurau
tasyaite kathita hy arthah
prakasante mahatmanah
"Only unto one who has unflinching devotion to the Lord and to the spiritual master does
transcendental knowledge become automatically revealed." Such relationship between the disciple and the
spiritual master is eternal. One who is now the disciple is the next spiritual master. And one cannot be a
bona fide and authorized spiritual master unless one has been strictly obedient to his spiritual master.
Brahmaji, as a disciple of the Supreme Lord, received the real knowledge and imparted it to his dear
disciple Narada, and similarly Narada, as spiritual master, handed over this knowledge to Vyasa and so
on. Therefore the so-called formal spiritual master and disciple are not facsimiles of Brahma and Narada
or Narada and Vyasa. The relationship between Brahma and Narada is reality, while the so-called
formality is the relation between the cheater and cheated. It is clearly mentioned herewith that Narada is
not only well behaved, meek and obedient, but also self-controlled. One who is not self-controlled,
specifically in sex life, can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. One must have disciplinary
training in controlling speaking, anger, the tongue, the mind, the belly and the genitals. One who has
controlled the particular senses mentioned above is called a gosvami. Without becoming a gosvami one
can become neither a disciple nor a spiritual master. The so-called spiritual master without sense control
is certainly the cheater, and the disciple of such a so-called spiritual master is the cheated.
One should not think of Brahmaji as a dead great-grandfather, as we have experience on this planet. He
is the oldest great-grandfather, and he is still living, and Narada is also living. The age of the inhabitants
of the Brahmaloka planet is mentioned in the Bhagavad-gita. The inhabitants of this small planet earth can
hardly calculate even the duration of one day of Brahma.
