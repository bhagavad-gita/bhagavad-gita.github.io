The individual person possessing different instruments of senses is called the adhyatmic person, and the
individual controlling deity of the senses is called adhidaivic. The embodiment seen on the eyeballs is
called the adhibhautic person.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The supreme controlling summum bonum is the personality of Godhead in His plenary portion of
Paramatma, or the Supersoul manifestation. In the Bhagavad-gita (10.42) it is said:
athava bahunaitena
kim jnatena tavarjuna
vistabhyaham idam krtsnam
ekamsena sthito jagat
All the controlling deities like Visnu, Brahma and Siva are different manifestations of the Paramatma
feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, who exhibits himself in such manners by
entering into each and every universe generated from Him. But still apparently there are divisions of the
controller and controlled. For example, in the food-controlling department the controller of food is a
person made of the same ingredients as the person who is controlled. Similarly, each and every individual
in the material world is controlled by the higher demigods. For example, we have our senses, but the
senses are controlled by superior controlling deities. We cannot see without light, and the supreme
controller of light is the sun. The sun-god is in the sun planet, and we, the individual human beings or
any other being on this earth, are all controlled by the sun-god as far as our eyes are concerned. Similarly,
all the senses we have are controlled by the superior demigods, who are also as much living entities as we
are, but one is empowered while the other is controlled. The controlled living entity is called the
adhyatmic person, and the controller is called the adhidaivic person. All these positions in the material
world are due to different fruitive activities. Any individual living being can become the sun-god or even
Brahma or any other god in the upper planetary system by a higher grade of pious work, and similarly one
becomes controlled by the higher demigods by lower grades of fruitive activities. So every individual
living entity is subject to the supreme control of the Paramatma, who puts everyone in different positions
of the controller and the controlled.
That which distinguishes the controller and controlled, i.e. the material body, is called the adhibhautic
purusa. The body is sometimes called purusa, as confirmed in the Vedas in the following hymn: sa va esa
puruso 'nna-rasamayah. This body is called the anna-rasa embodiment. This body depends on food. The
living entity which is embodied does not eat anything, however, because the owner is spirit in essence.
The material body requires replacement of matter for the wearing and tearing of the mechanical body.
Therefore the distinction between the individual living entity and controlling planetary deities is in the
anna-rasamaya body. The sun may have a gigantic body, and the man may have a smaller body, but all
these visible bodies are made of matter; nonetheless, the sun-god and the individual person, who are
related as the controller and the controlled, are the same spiritual parts and parcels of the Supreme Being,
and it is the Supreme Being who places different parts and parcels in different positions. And thus the
conclusion is that the Supreme Person is the shelter of all.
