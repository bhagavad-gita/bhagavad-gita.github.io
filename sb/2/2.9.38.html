ajanah--the Supreme Lord; jananam--of the living entities; paramesthinam--unto the supreme leader,
Brahma; pasyatah--while he was seeing; tasya--His; tat rupam--that transcendental form; atmanah--of the
Absolute; nyarunat--disappeared; harih--the Lord, the Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said to Maharaja Pariksit: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, after being
seen in His transcendental form, instructing Brahmaji, the leader of the living entities, disappeared.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse it is clearly mentioned that the Lord is ajanah, or the Supreme Person, and that He was
showing His transcendental form (atmano rupam) to Brahmaji while instructing him in the
summarization of Srimad-Bhagavatam in four verses. He is ajanah, or the Supreme Person, amongst
jananam, or all persons. All living entities are individual persons, and amongst all such persons Lord Hari
is supreme, as confirmed in the sruti-mantra, nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. So there is no place for
impersonal features in the transcendental world as there are impersonal features in the material world.
Whenever there is cetana, or knowledge, the personal feature comes in. In the spiritual world everything
is full of knowledge, and therefore everything in the transcendental world, the land, the water, the tree,
the mountain, the river, the man, the animal, the bird--everything--is of the same quality, namely cetana,
and therefore everything there is individual and personal. Srimad-Bhagavatam gives us this information as
the supreme Vedic literature, and it was personally instructed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to
Brahmaji so that the leader of the living entities might broadcast the message to all in the universe in
order to teach the supreme knowledge of bhakti-yoga. Brahmaji in his turn instructed Narada, his beloved
son, the same message of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and Narada, in his turn, taught the same to Vyasadeva, who
again taught it to Sukadeva Gosvami. Through Sukadeva Gosvami's grace and by the mercy of Maharaja
Pariksit we are all given Srimad-Bhagavatam perpetually to learn the science of the Absolute Personality of
Godhead, Lord Krsna.
