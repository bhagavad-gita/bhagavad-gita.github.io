TRANSLATION
O Narada, now I shall state, one after another, the transcendental incarnations of the Lord known as
lila-avataras. Hearing of their activities counteracts all foul matters accumulated in the ear. These pastimes
are pleasing to hear and are to be relished. Therefore they are in my heart.
PURPORT
As it was said in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.8), one cannot be fully satisfied by hearing
unless and until one is given a chance to hear of the transcendental activities of the Lord. So Brahmaji is
also trying, in this verse, to stress the importance of narrating the transcendental pastimes of the Lord as
He comes and manifests Himself here on the surface of the material planets. Every living entity has a
tendency to hear pleasing messages, and as such almost every one of us is inclined to hear news and talks
broadcast by the radio stations. But the difficulty is that no one is satisfied at heart by hearing all those
messages. The cause of such dissatisfaction is the incompatibility of the message with the innermost
stratum of the living soul. This transcendental literature is especially prepared by Srila Vyasadeva to give
the utmost satisfaction to the people in general by narration of the activities of the Lord, as instructed by
Sri Narada Muni to Srila Vyasadeva. Such activities of the Lord are principally of two varieties. One
concerns the mundane manifestation of the material creative force, and the other deals with His pastimes
in the form of different incarnations in terms of the time and place. There are innumerable incarnations of
the Lord, like the waves of the river flowing constantly in and out. Less intelligent persons take more
interest in the creative forces of the Lord in the material world, and, being disconnected from their
relationship with the Lord, they put forward many theories of the creation in the name of scientific
research. The devotees of the Lord, however, know well how the creative forces work concurrently by the
action and reaction of the material energy of the Lord. Therefore they take more interest in the
transcendental activities of the Lord as He incarnates Himself on the surface of the material world.
Srimad-Bhagavatam is the history of such activities of the Lord, and people who take interest in hearing
Srimad-Bhagavatam clear their hearts of accumulated mundane filth. There are a thousand and one rash
literatures on the market, but one who has taken interest in the Srimad-Bhagavatam loses all interest in
such filthy literatures. Sri Brahmaji is thus attempting to narrate the principal incarnations of the Lord so
that they may be drunk by Narada as transcendental nectar.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled " Purusa-sukta Confirmed."
