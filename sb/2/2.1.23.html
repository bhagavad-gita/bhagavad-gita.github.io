<h2>Text</h2>
sri-suka uvaca
jitasano jita-svaso
jita-sango jitendriyah
sthule bhagavato rupe
manah sandharayed dhiya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-sukah uvaca--Sukadeva Gosvami said; jita-asanah--controlled sitting posture; jita-svasah--controlled
breathing process; jita-sangah--controlled association; jita-indriyah--controlled senses; sthule--in the gross
matter; bhagavatah--unto the Personality of Godhead; rupe--in the feature of; manah--the mind;
sandharayet--must apply; dhiya--by intelligence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami answered: One should control the sitting posture, regulate the breathing process by
the yogic pranayama and thus control the mind and senses and with intelligence apply the mind to the
gross potencies of the Lord [called the virat-rupa].
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The materially absorbed mind of the conditioned soul does not allow him to transcend the limit of the
bodily conception of self, and thus the yoga system for meditation (controlling the sitting posture and
breathing process and fixing the mind upon the Supreme) is prescribed in order to mold the character of
the gross materialist. Unless such materialists are able to cleanse the materially absorbed mind, it is
impossible for them to concentrate upon thoughts of transcendence. And to do so one may fix one's mind
on the gross material or external feature of the Lord. The different parts of the gigantic form of the Lord
are described in the following verses. The materialistic men are very anxious to have some mystic powers
as a result of such a controlling process, but the real purpose of yogic regulations is to eradicate the
accumulated dirty things like lust, anger, avarice and all such material contaminations. If the mystic yogi
is diverted by the accompanying feats of mystic control, then his mission of yogic success is a failure,
because the ultimate aim is God realization. He is therefore recommended to fix his gross materialistic
mind by a different conception and thus realize the potency of the Lord. As soon as the potencies are
understood to be instrumental manifestations of the transcendence, one automatically advances to the
next step, and gradually the stage of full realization becomes possible for him.
