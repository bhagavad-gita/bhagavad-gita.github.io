<h2>Translation</h2>
On the very night of the day of the chastisement of the Kaliya snake, when the inhabitants of
Vrajabhumi were sleeping carefreely, there was a forest fire ablaze due to dry leaves, and it appeared that
all the inhabitants were sure to meet their death. But the Lord, along with Balarama, saved them simply by
closing His eyes. Such are the superhuman activities of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although in this verse the Lord's activity has been described as superhuman, it should be noted that the
Lord's activities are always superhuman, and that distinguishes Him from the ordinary living being.
Uprooting a gigantic banyan or arjuna tree and extinguishing a blazing forest fire simply by closing one's
eyes are certainly impossible by any kind of human endeavor. But not only are these activities amazing to
hear, but in fact all other activities of the Lord, whatever He may do, are all superhuman, as confirmed in
the Bhagavad-gita (4.9). Whoever knows the superhuman activities of the Lord, due to their very
transcendental nature, becomes eligible to enter the kingdom of Krsna, and as such, after quitting this
present material body, the knower of the transcendental activities of the Lord goes back home, back to
Godhead.
