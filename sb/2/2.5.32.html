<h2>Text</h2>
yadaite 'sangata bhava
bhutendriya-mano-gunah
yadayatana-nirmane
na sekur brahma-vittama
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--as long as; ete--all these; asangatah--without being assembled; bhavah--remained so situated;
bhuta--elements; indriya--senses; manah--mind; gunah--modes of nature; yada--so long; ayatana--the
body; nirmane--in being formed; na sekuh--was not possible; brahma-vit-tama--O Narada, the best
knower of transcendental knowledge.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Narada, best of the transcendentalists, the forms of the body cannot take place as long as these
created parts, namely the elements, senses, mind and modes of nature, are not assembled.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The different types of bodily construction of the living entities are exactly like different types of
motorcars manufactured by assembling the allied motor parts. When the car is ready, the driver sits in the
car and moves it as he desires. This is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (18.61): the living entity is as if
seated on the machine of the body, and the car of the body is moving by the control of material nature,
just as the railway trains are moving under the direction of the controller. The living entities, however, are
not the bodies; they are separate from the cars of the body. But the less intelligent material scientist
cannot understand the process of assembling the parts of the body, namely the senses, the mind and the
qualities of the material modes. Every living entity is a spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme
Being, and by the kindness of the Lord, for the Father is kind to His sons, the individual living beings are
given a little freedom to act according to their will to lord it over the material nature. Just as a father gives
some playthings to the crying child to satisfy him, the whole material creation is made possible by the will
of the Lord to allow the bewildered living entities to lord it over things as they desire, although under the
control of the agent of the Lord. The living entities are exactly like small children playing the material
field under the control of the maidservant of the Lord (nature). They accept the maya, or the maidservant,
as all in all and thus wrongly conceive the Supreme Truth to be feminine (goddess Durga, etc.). The
foolish, childlike materialists cannot reach beyond the conception of the maidservant, material nature, but
the intelligent grown-up sons of the Lord know well that all the acts of material nature are controlled by
the Lord, just as a maidservant is under the control of the master, the father of the undeveloped children.
The parts of the body, such as the senses, are the creation of the mahat-tattva, and when they are
assembled by the will of the Lord, the material body comes into existence, and the living entity is allowed
to use it for further activities. This is explained as follows.
