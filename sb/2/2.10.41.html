<h2>Translation</h2>
According to the different modes of material nature--the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the
mode of darkness--there are different living creatures, who are known as demigods, human beings and
hellish living entities. O King, even a particular mode of nature, being mixed with the other two, is
divided into three, and thus each kind of living creature is influenced by the other modes and acquires its
habits also.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The living entities individually are being conducted by a particular mode of nature, but at the same time
there is every chance of their being influenced by the other two. Generally, all conditioned souls in the
material encagement are influenced by the mode of passion because every one of them is trying to lord it
over the material nature to fulfill his individual desire. But in spite of the individual mode of passion,
there is always the chance of being influenced by the other modes of nature by association. If one is in
good association he can develop the mode of goodness, and if in bad association he may develop the mode
of darkness or ignorance. Nothing is stereotyped. One can change his habit by good or bad association,
and one has to become intelligent enough to discriminate between good and bad. The best association is
the service of the devotees of the Lord, and by that association one can become the highest qualified man
by the grace of the Lord's pure devotees. As we have already seen in the life of Srila Narada Muni, he
became the topmost devotee of the Lord simply by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. By birth
he was the son of a maidservant and had no knowledge of his father and no academic education, even of
the lowest status. But simply by associating with the devotees and by eating the remnants of their
foodstuff, he gradually developed the transcendental qualities of the devotees. By such association, his
taste for chanting and hearing the transcendental glories of the Lord became prominent, and because the
glories of the Lord are nondifferent from the Lord, he got direct association with the Lord by means of
sound representation. Similarly, there is the life of Ajamila (Sixth Canto), who was the son of a brahmana
and was educated and trained properly in the discharge of the duties of a brahmana, but who in spite of
all this, because he contacted the bad association of a prostitute, was put into the path of the lowest
quality of candala, or the last position for a human being. Therefore the Bhagavatam always recommends
the association of the mahat, or the great soul, for opening the gate of salvation. To associate with persons
engaged in lording it over the material world means to enter into the darkest region of hell. One should
try to raise himself by the association of the great soul. That is the way of the perfection of life.
