nirabhidyata sisno vai
prajanandamrtarthinah
upastha asit kamanam
priyam tad-ubhayasrayam
SYNONYMS
nirabhidyata--came out; sisnah--the genitals; vai--certainly; praja-ananda--sex pleasure; amrta-arthinah--
aspiring to taste the nectar; upasthah--the male or female organ; asit--came into existence; kamanam--of
the lustful; priyam--very dear; tat--that; ubhaya-asrayam--shelter for both.
TRANSLATION
Thereupon, for sexual pleasure, begetting offspring and tasting heavenly nectar, the Lord developed the
genitals, and thus there is the genital organ and its controlling deity, the Prajapati. The object of sexual
pleasure and the controlling deity are under the control of the genitals of the Lord.
PURPORT
The heavenly pleasure for the conditioned soul is sexual pleasure, and this pleasure is tasted by the
genitals. The woman is the object of sexual pleasure, and both the sense perception of sexual pleasure and
the woman are controlled by the Prajapati, who is under the control of the Lord's genitals. The
impersonalist must know from this verse that the Lord is not impersonal, for He has His genitals, on
which all the pleasurable objects of sex depend. No one would have taken the trouble to maintain
children if there were no taste of heavenly nectar by means of sexual intercourse. This material world is
created to give the conditioned souls a chance for rejuvenation for going back home, back to Godhead,
and therefore generation of the living being is necessary for upkeep of the purpose of creation. Sexual
pleasure is an impetus for such action, and as such one can even serve the Lord in the act of such sexual
pleasure. The service is counted when the children born of such sexual pleasure are properly trained in
God consciousness. The whole idea of material creation is to revive the dormant God consciousness of the
living entity. In forms of life other than the human form, sexual pleasure is prominent without any motive
of service for the mission of the Lord. But in the human form of life the conditioned soul can render
service to the Lord by creating progeny suitable for the attainment of salvation. One can beget hundreds
of children and enjoy the celestial pleasure of sexual intercourse, provided he is able to train the children
in God consciousness. Otherwise begetting children is on the level of the swine. Rather, the swine is more
expert than the human being because the swine can beget a dozen piglets at a time, whereas the human
being can give birth to only one at a time. So one should always remember that the genitals, sexual
pleasure, the woman and the offspring are all related in the service of the Lord, and one who forgets this
relationship in the service of the Supreme Lord becomes subjected to the threefold miseries of material
existence by the laws of nature. Perception of sexual pleasure is there even in the body of the dog, but
there is no sense of God consciousness. The human form of life is distinct from that of the dog by the
perception of God consciousness.
