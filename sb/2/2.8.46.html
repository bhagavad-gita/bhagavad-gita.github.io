TRANSLATION
Surrendered souls, even from groups leading sinful lives, such as women, the laborer class, the
mountaineers and the Siberians, or even the birds and beasts, can also know about the science of Godhead
and become liberated from the clutches of the illusory energy by surrendering unto the pure devotees of
the Lord and by following in their footsteps in devotional service.
PURPORT
Sometimes there are inquiries as to how one can surrender unto the Supreme Lord. In the Bhagavad-gita
(18.66) the Lord asked Arjuna to surrender unto Him, and therefore persons unwilling to do so question
where God is and to whom they should surrender. The answer to such questions or inquiries is given
herein very properly. The Personality of Godhead may not be present before one's eyes, but if one is
sincere in wanting such guidance the Lord will send a bona fide person who can guide one properly back
home, back to Godhead. There is no need of material qualifications for making progress on the path of
spiritual realization. In the material world, when one accepts some particular type of service, he is
required to possess some particular type of qualification also. Without this one is unfit for such service.
But in the devotional service of the Lord the only qualification required is surrender. Surrendering oneself
is in one's own hand. If one likes, he can surrender immediately, without delay, and that begins his
spiritual life. The bona fide representative of God is as good as God Himself. Or, in other words, the
loving representative of the Lord is more kind and more easy to approach. A sinful soul cannot approach
the Lord directly, but such a sinful man can very easily approach a pure devotee of the Lord. And if one
agrees to put himself under the guidance of such a devotee of the Lord, he can also understand the science
of God and can also become like the transcendental pure devotee of the Lord and thus get his liberation
back to Godhead, back home for eternal happiness.
So realization of the science of Godhead and relief from the unnecessary, useless struggle for existence
are not at all difficult for the willing candidate. But they are very difficult for persons who are not
surrendered souls but only simple, profitless speculators.
