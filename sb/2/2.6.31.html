<h2>Text</h2>
narayane bhagavati
tad idam visvam ahitam
grhita-mayoru-gunah
sargadav agunah svatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
narayane--unto Narayana; bhagavati--the Personality of Godhead; tat idam--all these material
manifestations; visvam--all the universes; ahitam--situated; grhita--having accepted; maya--material
energies; uru-gunah--greatly powerful; sarga-adau--in creation, maintenance and destruction; agunah--
without affinity for the material modes; svatah--self-sufficiently.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All the material manifestations of the universes are therefore situated in His powerful material energies,
which He accepts self-sufficiently, although He is eternally without affinity for the material modes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The question put by Narada before Brahma concerning the sustenance of the material creation is thus
answered. Material actions and reactions, as the material scientist can superficially observe, are not
basically ultimate truth in regard to creation, maintenance and destruction. The material energy is a
potency of the Lord which is displayed in time, accepting the three qualities of goodness, passion and
ignorance in the forms of Visnu, Brahma and Siva. The material energy thus works under the supreme
spell of His Lordship, although He is always transcendental to all such material activities. A rich man
constructs a big house by spending his energy in the shape of resources, and similarly he destroys a big
house by his resources, but the maintenance is always under his personal care. The Lord is the richest of
the rich because He is always fully complete in six opulences. Therefore He is not required to do anything
personally, but everything in the material world is carried out by His wishes and direction; therefore, the
entire material manifestation is situated in Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
impersonal conception of the supreme truth is due to lack of knowledge only, and this fact is clearly
explained by Brahmaji, who is supposed to be the creator of the universal affairs. Brahmaji is the highest
authority in Vedic wisdom, and his assertion in this connection is therefore the supreme information.
