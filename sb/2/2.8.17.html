<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead, and all the incarnations of the Supreme Lord,
although nondifferent from Him, are emanations from the Supreme. Maharaja Pariksit inquired from the
great and learned sage Sukadeva Gosvami about the different activities of such incarnations so that the
incarnation of the Lord might be confirmed by His activities in the authoritative scriptures. Maharaja
Pariksit was not to be carried away by the sentiments of the common man to accept an incarnation of the
Lord very cheaply. Instead he wished to accept the incarnation of the Lord by symptoms mentioned in the
Vedic literatures and confirmed by an acarya like Sukadeva Gosvami. The Lord descends by His internal
energy without any obligation to the laws of material nature, and thus His activities are also uncommon.
The specific activities of the Lord are mentioned, and one should know that the activities of the Lord and
the Lord Himself are identical due to being on the absolute plane. Thus to hear the activities of the Lord
means to associate with the Lord directly, and association with the Lord directly means purification from
material contamination. We have already discussed this point in the previous volume.
