sa atma svasrayasrayah

TRANSLATION
All three of the above-mentioned stages of different living entities are interdependent. In the absence of
one, another is not understood. But the Supreme Being who sees every one of them as the shelter of the
shelter is independent of all, and therefore He is the supreme shelter.
PURPORT
There are innumerable living entities, one dependent on the other in the relationship of the controlled
and the controller. But without the medium of perception, no one can know or understand who is the
controlled and who is the controller. For example, the sun controls the power of our vision, we can see
the sun because the sun has its body, and the sunlight is useful only because we have eyes. Without our
having eyes, the sunlight is useless, and without sunlight the eyes are useless. Thus they are
interdependent, and none of them is independent. Therefore the natural question arises concerning who
made them interdependent. The one who has made such a relationship of interdependence must be
ultimately completely independent. As stated in the beginning of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the ultimate
source of all interdependent objectives is the complete independent subject. This ultimate source of all
interdependence is the Supreme Truth or Paramatma, the Supersoul, who is not dependent on anything
else. He is svasrayasrayah. He is only dependent on His self, and thus He is the supreme shelter of
everything. Although Paramatma and Brahman are subordinate to Bhagavan, because Bhagavan is
Purusottama or the Superperson, He is the source of the Supersoul also. In the Bhagavad-gita (15.18) Lord
Krsna says that He is the Purusottama and the source of everything, and thus it is concluded that Sri
Krsna is the ultimate source and shelter of all entities, including the Supersoul and Supreme Brahman.
Even accepting that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul, the individual
soul is dependent on the Supersoul for being liberated from the illusion of material energy. The individual
is under the clutches of illusory energy, and therefore although qualitatively one with the Supersoul, he is
under the illusion of identifying himself with matter. And to get out of this illusory conception of factual
life, the individual soul has to depend on the Supersoul to be recognized as one with Him. In that sense
also the Supersoul is the supreme shelter. And there is no doubt about it.
The individual living entity, the jiva, is always dependent on the Supersoul, Paramatma, because the
individual soul forgets his spiritual identity whereas the Supersoul, Paramatma, does not forget His
transcendental position. In the Bhagavad-gita these separate positions of the jiva-atma and the Paramatma
are specifically mentioned. In the Fourth Chapter, Arjuna, the jiva soul, is represented as forgetful of his
many, many previous births, but the Lord, the Supersoul, is not forgetful. The Lord even remembers when
He taught the Bhagavad-gita to the sun-god some billions of years before. The Lord can remember such
millions and billions of years, as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (7.26) as follows:
vedaham samatitani
vartamanani carjuna
bhavisyani ca bhutani
mam tu veda na kascana
The Lord in His eternal blissful body of knowledge is fully aware of all that happened in the past, that
which is going on at the present and also what will happen in the future. But in spite of His being the
shelter of both the Paramatma and Brahman, persons with a poor fund of knowledge are unable to
understand Him as He is.
The propaganda of the identity of cosmic consciousness with the consciousness of the individual living
entities is completely misleading because even such a person or individual soul as Arjuna could not
remember his past deeds, although he is always with the Lord. And what can the tiny ordinary man,
falsely claiming to be one with the cosmic consciousness, know about his past, present and future?
