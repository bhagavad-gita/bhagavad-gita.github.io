TRANSLATION
Thus I created the ingredients and paraphernalia for offering sacrifice out of the parts of the body of the
Supreme Lord, the enjoyer of the sacrifice, and I performed the sacrifice to satisfy the Lord.
PURPORT
People in general are always anxious to have peace of mind or peace in the world, but they do not know
how to achieve such a standard of peace in the world. Such peace in the world is obtainable by
performances of sacrifice and by practice of austerity. In the Bhagavad-gita (5.29) the following
prescription is recommended:
bhoktaram yajna-tapasam
sarva-loka-mahesvaram
suhrdam sarva-bhutanam
jnatva mam santim rcchati
"The karma-yogis know that the Supreme Lord is the factual enjoyer and maintainer of all sacrifices and
of the austere life. They also know that the Lord is the ultimate proprietor of all the planets and is the
factual friend of all living entities. Such knowledge gradually converts the karma-yogis into pure devotees
of the Lord through the association of unalloyed devotees, and thus they are able to be liberated from
material bondage."
Brahma, the original living being within the material world, taught us the way of sacrifice. The word
"sacrifice" suggests dedication of one's own interests for satisfaction of a second person. That is the way of
all activities. Every man is engaged in sacrificing his interests for others, either in the form of family,
society, community, country or the entire human society. But perfection of such sacrifices is attained
when they are performed for the sake of the Supreme Person, the Lord. Because the Lord is the proprietor
of everything, because the Lord is the friend of all living creatures, and because He is the maintainer of the
performer of sacrifice, as well as the supplier of the ingredients of sacrifices, it is He only and no one else
who should be satisfied by all sacrifices.
The whole world is engaged in sacrificing energy for advancement of learning, social upliftment,
economic development and plans for total improvement of the human condition, but no one is interested
in sacrificing for the sake of the Lord, as it is advised in the Bhagavad-gita. Therefore, there is no peace in
the world. If men at all want peace in the world, they must practice sacrifice in the interest of the supreme
proprietor and friend of all.
