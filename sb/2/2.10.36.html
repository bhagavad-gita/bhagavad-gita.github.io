<h2>Translation</h2>
He, the Personality of Godhead, manifests Himself in a transcendental form, being the subject of His
transcendental name, quality, pastimes, entourage and transcendental variegatedness. Although He is
unaffected by all such activities, He appears to be so engaged.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Whenever there is a need of material creation, the transcendental Personality of Godhead accepts forms
in the material world for creation, maintenance and destruction. One should be intelligent enough to
know His activities in truth and not be biased to conclude that He descends to the material world by
accepting a form created by material nature. Any form accepted from the material nature has its affection
for everything done in the material world. A conditioned soul who accepts a material form for undergoing
a certain term of material activities is subjected to the laws of matter. But here in this verse it is clearly
stated that although the forms and activities of the Lord appear to be the same as those of a conditioned
soul, they are supernatural and impossible for the conditioned soul. He, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is always unaffected by such activities. In the Bhagavad-gita (4.14) the Lord says:
na mam karmani limpanti
na me karma-phale sprha
iti mam yo 'bhijanati
karmabhir na sa badhyate
The Lord is never affected by the activities which He apparently performs by His different incarnations
and personalities, nor does He have any desire to achieve success by fruitive activities. The Lord is full by
His different potencies of wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, and thus He has no
reason for physical exertion like the conditioned soul. Therefore an intelligent person who can distinguish
between the transcendental activities of the Lord and the activities of the conditioned souls is also not
bound by the reactions of activities. The Lord as Visnu, Brahma and Siva conducts the three modes of
material nature. From Visnu is born Brahma, and from Brahma is born Siva. Sometimes Brahma is a
separated part of Visnu, and sometimes Brahma is Visnu Himself. Thus Brahma creates the different
species of life all over the universe, which means that the Lord creates the whole manifestation either by
Himself or through the agency of His authorized deputies.
