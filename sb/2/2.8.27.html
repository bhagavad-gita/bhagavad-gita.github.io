kathayam iti sat-pateh
brahmarato bhrsam prito
visnuratena samsadi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sutah uvaca--Srila Suta Gosvami said; sah--he (Sukadeva Gosvami); upamantritah--thus being inquired;
rajna--by the King; kathayam--in the topics; iti--thus; sat-pateh--of the highest truth; brahma-ratah--
Sukadeva Gosvami; bhrsam--very much; pritah--pleased; visnu-ratena--by Maharaja Pariksit; samsadi--in
the meeting.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Suta Gosvami said: Thus Sukadeva Gosvami, being invited by Maharaja Pariksit to speak on topics of
the Lord Sri Krsna with the devotees, was very much pleased.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Srimad-Bhagavatam can be legitimately discussed only among the devotees of the Lord. As the
Bhagavad-gita was authoritatively discussed between Lord Krsna and Arjuna (the Lord and the devotee
respectively), similarly Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is the postgraduate study of the Bhagavad-gita, can also
be discussed between the scholars and devotees like Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja Pariksit. Otherwise
the real taste of the nectar cannot be relished. Sukadeva Gosvami was pleased with Maharaja Pariksit
because he was not at all tired of hearing the topics of the Lord and was more and more anxious to hear
them on and on with interest. Foolish interpreters unnecessarily tackle the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam when they have no access to the subject matter. There is no use in nondevotees' meddling
with the two topmost Vedic literatures, and therefore Sankaracarya did not touch Srimad-Bhagavatam for
commentation. In his commentation on the Bhagavad-gita, Sripada Sankaracarya accepted Lord Krsna as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but later on he commented from the impersonalist's view. But, being
conscious of his position, he did not comment on the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Srila Sukadeva Gosvami was protected by Lord Krsna (vide Brahma-vaivarta Purana), and therefore he is
known as Brahmarata, and Sriman Pariksit Maharaja was protected by Visnu, and thus he is known as
Visnurata. As devotees of the Lord, they are always protected by the Lord. It is clear also in this
connection that a Visnurata should hear Srimad-Bhagavatam from Brahmarata and no one else because
others misrepresent the transcendental knowledge and thus spoil one's valuable time.
