TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead assumed the incarnation of Nrsimhadeva in order to vanquish the great
fears of the demigods. He killed the king of the demons [Hiranyakasipu], who challenged the Lord with a
club in his hand, by placing the demon on His thighs and piercing him with His nails, rolling His
eyebrows in anger and showing His fearful teeth and mouth.
PURPORT
The history of Hiranyakasipu and his great devotee-son Prahlada Maharaja is narrated in the Seventh
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Hiranyakasipu became very powerful by material achievements and thought
himself to be immortal by the grace of Brahmaji. Brahmaji declined to award him the benediction of
immortality because he himself is not an immortal being. But Hiranyakasipu derived Brahmaji's
benediction in a roundabout way, almost equal to becoming an immortal being. Hiranyakasipu was sure
that he would not be killed by any man or demigod or by any kind of known weapon, nor would he die in
day or night. The Lord, however, assumed the incarnation of half-man and half-lion, which was beyond
the imagination of a materialistic demon like Hiranyakasipu, and thus, keeping pace with the benediction
of Brahmaji, the Lord killed him. He killed him on His lap, so that he was killed neither on the land nor
on the water nor in the sky. The demon was pierced by Nrsimha's nails, which were beyond the human
weapons imaginable by Hiranyakasipu. The literal meaning of Hiranyakasipu is one who is after gold and
soft bedding, the ultimate aim of all materialistic men. Such demonic men, who have no relationship with
God, gradually become puffed up by material acquisitions and begin to challenge the authority of the
Supreme Lord and torture those who are devotees of the Lord. Prahlada Maharaja happened to be the son
of Hiranyakasipu, and because the boy was a great devotee, his father tortured him to the best of his
ability. In this extreme situation, the Lord assumed the incarnation of Nrsimhadeva, and just to finish the
enemy of the demigods, the Lord killed Hiranyakasipu in a manner beyond the demon's imagination.
Materialistic plans of godless demons are always frustrated by the all-powerful Lord.
