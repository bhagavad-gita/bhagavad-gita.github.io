<h2>Text</h2>
apam viryasya sargasya
parjanyasya prajapateh
pumsah sisna upasthas tu
prajaty-ananda-nirvrteh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
apam--of water; viryasya--of the semen; sargasya--of the generative; parjanyasya--of rains; prajapateh--of
the creator; pumsah--of the Lord; sisnah--the genitals; upasthah tu--the place where the genitals are
situated; prajati--due to begetting; ananda--pleasure; nirvrteh--cause.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
From the Lord's genitals originate water, semen, generatives, rains, and the procreators. His genitals are
the cause of a pleasure that counteracts the distress of begetting.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The genitals and the pleasure of begetting counteract the distresses of family encumbrances. One would
cease to generate altogether if there were not, by the grace of the Lord, a coating, a pleasure-giving
substance, on the surface of the generative organs. This substance gives a pleasure so intense that it
counteracts fully the distress of family encumbrances. A person is so captivated by this pleasure-giving
substance that he is not satisfied by begetting a single child, but increases the number of children, with
great risk in regard to maintaining them, simply for this pleasure-giving substance. This pleasure-giving
substance is not false, however, because it originates from the transcendental body of the Lord. In other
words, the pleasure-giving substance is a reality, but it has taken on an aspect of pervertedness on account
of material contamination. In the material world, sex life is the cause of many distresses on account of
material contact. Therefore, the sex life in the material world should not be encouraged beyond the
necessity. There is a necessity for generating progeny even in the material world, but such generation of
children must be carried out with full responsibility for spiritual values. The spiritual values of life can be
realized in the human form of material existence, and the human being must adopt family planning with
reference to the context of spiritual values, and not otherwise. The degraded form of family restriction by
use of contraceptives, etc., is the grossest type of material contamination. Materialists who use these
devices want to fully utilize the pleasure potency of the coating on the genitals by artificial means, without
knowing the spiritual importance. And without knowledge of spiritual values, the less intelligent man
tries to utilize only the material sense pleasure of the genitals.
