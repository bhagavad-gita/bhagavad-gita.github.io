TRANSLATION
My dear son, I have now explained in brief the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is creator of the
manifested worlds. Without Him, Hari, the Lord, there are no other causes of the phenomenal and
noumenal existences.
PURPORT
Since we generally have the experience of the temporary, material world and conditioned souls trying to
lord it over the material worlds, Brahmaji explained to Naradadeva that this temporary world is the work
of the external potency of the Lord and that the conditioned souls struggling here for existence are the
marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead. There is no cause for all these
phenomenal activities but Him, Hari, the Supreme Lord, who is the primeval cause of all causes. This does
not mean, however, that the Lord Himself is distributed impersonally. He is aloof from all these
interactions of the external and marginal potencies. In the Bhagavad-gita (9.4) it is confirmed that by His
potencies alone He is present everywhere and anywhere. Everything that is manifested rests on His
potency only, but He, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always aloof from everything. The
potency and the potent are simultaneously one and different from one another.
One should not deprecate the Supreme Lord for the creation of this miserable world, just as one should
not blame the king for creating a prisonhouse in the government. The prisonhouse is a necessary
institution of the governmental establishment for those who are disobedient to the laws of the
government. Similarly, this material world, full of miseries, is a temporary creation of the Lord for those
who have forgotten Him and are trying to lord it over the false manifestation. He, however, is always
anxious to get the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead, and for this He has given so many chances to
the conditioned souls via the authoritative scriptures, His representatives, and personal incarnations also.
Since He has no direct attachment to this material world, He is not to be blamed for its creation.
