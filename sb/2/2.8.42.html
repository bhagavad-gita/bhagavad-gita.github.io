yesam sa esa bhagavan dayayed anantah
sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam

SYNONYMS
yesam--unto those only; sah--the Lord; esah--the; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; dayayet--does
bestow His mercy; anantah--the unlimited potential; sarva-atmana--by all means, without reservation;
asrita-padah--surrendered soul; yadi--if such surrender; nirvyalikam--without pretension; te--those only;
dustaram--insurmountable; atitaranti--can overcome; ca--and the paraphernalia; deva-mayam--diverse
energies of the Lord; na--not; esam--of them; mama--mine; aham--myself; iti--thus; dhih--conscious; sva--
dogs; srgala--jackals; bhaksye--in the matter of eating.
TRANSLATION
But anyone who is specifically favored by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, due to
unalloyed surrender unto the service of the Lord, can overcome the insurmountable ocean of illusion and
can understand the Lord. But those who are attached to this body, which is meant to be eaten at the end
by dogs and jackals, cannot do so.
PURPORT
The unalloyed devotees of the Lord know the glories of the Lord in the sense that they can understand
how great the Lord is and how great is His expansion of diverse energy. Those who are attached to the
perishable body can hardly enter into the realm of the science of Godhead. The whole materialistic world,
based on the conception of the material body as the self, is ignorant of the science of God. The materialist
is always busy working for the welfare of the material body, not only his own but also those of his
children, kinsmen, communitymen, countrymen, etc. The materialists have many branches of
philanthropic and altruistic activities from a political, national and international angle of vision, but none
of the field work can go beyond the jurisdiction of the misconception of identifying the material body
with the spirit soul. Unless, therefore, one is saved from the wrong conception of the body and the soul,
there is no knowledge of Godhead, and unless there is knowledge of God, all advancement of material
civilization, however dazzling, should be considered a failure.

TRANSLATION
O Narada, although the potencies of the Lord are unknowable and immeasurable, still, because we are
all surrendered souls, we know how He acts through yogamaya potencies. And, similarly, the potencies of
the Lord are also known to the all-powerful Siva, the great king of the atheist family, namely Prahlada
Maharaja, Svayambhuva Manu, his wife Satarupa, his sons and daughters like Priyavrata, Uttanapada,
Akuti, Devahuti and Prasuti, Pracinabarhi, Rbhu, Anga the father of Vena, Maharaja Dhruva, Iksvaku,
Aila, Mucukunda, Maharaja Janaka, Gadhi, Raghu, Ambarisa, Sagara, Gaya, Nahusa, Mandhata, Alarka,
Satadhanve, Anu, Rantideva, Bhisma, Bali, Amurttaraya, Dilipa, Saubhari, Utanka, Sibi, Devala, Pippalada,
Sarasvata, Uddhava, Parasara, Bhurisena, Vibhisana, Hanuman, Sukadeva Gosvami, Arjuna, Arstisena,
Vidura, Srutadeva, etc.
PURPORT
All the great devotees of the Lord, as mentioned above, who flourished in the past or present, and all the
devotees of the Lord who will come in the future, are aware of the different potencies of the Lord along
with the potency of His name, quality, pastimes, entourage, personality, etc. And how do they know?
Certainly it is not by mental speculation, nor by any attempt by dint of limited instruments of knowledge.
By the limited instruments of knowledge (either the senses or the material instruments like microscopes
and telescopes) one cannot even fully know the Lord's material potencies, which are manifested before
our eyes. For example there are many millions and billions of planets far, far beyond the scientist's
calculation. But these are only the manifestations of the Lord's material energy. What can the scientist
hope to know of the spiritual potency of the Lord by such material efforts? Mental speculations, by adding
some dozens of "if's" and "maybe's," cannot aid the advancement of knowledge--on the contrary, such
mental speculations will only end in despair by dismissing the case abruptly and declaring the
nonexistence of God. The sane person, therefore, ceases to speculate on subjects beyond the jurisdiction
of his tiny brain, and as a matter of course he tries to learn to surrender unto the Supreme Lord, who
alone can lead one to the platform of real knowledge. In the Upanisads it is clearly said that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can never be known simply by working very hard and taxing the good brain, nor
can He be known simply by mental speculation and jugglery of words. The Lord is knowable only by one
who is a surrendered soul. Herein Brahmaji, the greatest of all material living beings, acknowledges this
truth. Therefore, the fruitless spoiling of energy by pursuing the path of experimental knowledge must be
given up. One should gain knowledge by surrendering unto the Lord and by acknowledging the authority
of the persons mentioned herein. The Lord is unlimited and, by the grace of the yogamaya, helps the
surrendered soul to know Him proportionately with the advance of one's surrender.
