<h2>Text</h2>
tada samhatya canyonyam
bhagavac-chakti-coditah
sad-asattvam upadaya
cobhayam sasrjur hy adah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tada--all those; samhatya--being assembled; ca--also; anyonyam--one another; bhagavat--by the
Personality of Godhead; sakti--energy; coditah--being applied; sat-asattvam--primarily and secondarily;
upadaya--accepting; ca--also; ubhayam--both; sasrjuh--came into existence; hi--certainly; adah--this
universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus when all these became assembled by force of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
this universe certainly came into being by accepting both the primary and secondary causes of creation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse it is clearly mentioned that the Supreme Personality of Godhead exerts His different
energies in the creation; it is not that He Himself is transformed into material creations. He expands
Himself by His different energies, as well as by His plenary portions. In a corner of the spiritual sky of
brahmajyoti a spiritual cloud sometimes appears, and the covered portion is called the mahat-tattva. The
Lord then, by His plenary portion as Maha-Visnu, lies down within the water of the mahat-tattva, and the
water is called the Causal Ocean (Karana-jala). While Maha-Visnu sleeps within the Causal Ocean,
innumerable universes are generated along with His breathing. These universes are floating, and they are
scattered all over the Causal Ocean. They stay only during the breathing period of Maha-Visnu. In each
and every universal globe, the same Maha-Visnu enters again as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and lies there on
the serpentlike Sesa incarnation. From His navel sprouts a lotus stem, and on the lotus, Brahma, the lord
of the universe, is born. Brahma creates all forms of living beings of different shapes in terms of different
desires within the universe. He also creates the sun, moon and other demigods.
Therefore the chief engineer of the material creation is the Lord Himself, as confirmed in the Bhagavadgita
(9.10). It is He only who directs the material nature to produce all sorts of moving and nonmoving
creations.
There are two modes of material creation: the creation of the collective universes, as stated above, done
by the Maha-Visnu, and the creation of the single universe. Both are done by the Lord, and thus the
universal shape, as we can see, takes place.
