TRANSLATION
O greatly fortunate Sukadeva Gosvami, please continue narrating Srimad-Bhagavatam so that I can place
my mind upon the Supreme Soul, Lord Krsna, and, being completely freed from material qualities, thus
relinquish this body.
PURPORT
To be fully engaged in hearing the transcendental narration described in the text of Srimad-Bhagavatam
means to constantly associate with the Supreme Soul, Sri Krsna. And to constantly associate with the
Supreme Lord Krsna means to be liberated from the qualities of matter. Lord Krsna is like the sun, and
material contamination is like darkness. As the presence of the sun dissipates darkness, constant
engagement in the association of the Lord Sri Krsna frees one from the contamination of the material
qualities. Contamination by the material qualities is the cause of repeated birth and death, and liberation
from material qualities is transcendence. Maharaja Pariksit was now a realized soul by this secret of
liberation, through the grace of Sukadeva Gosvami, for the latter had informed the King that the highest
perfection of life is to be in remembrance of Narayana at the end of life. Maharaja Pariksit was destined to
give up his body at the end of seven days, and thus he decided to continue remembering the Lord by His
association with the topics of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and thus to quit his body in full consciousness of the
presence of the Lord Sri Krsna, the Supreme Soul.
The hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam performed by professional men is different from the transcendental
hearing of Maharaja Pariksit. Maharaja Pariksit was a soul realized in the Absolute Truth, Sri Krsna, the
Personality of Godhead. The fruitive materialist is not a realized soul; he wants to derive some material
benefit from his so-called hearing of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Undoubtedly such an audience, hearing Srimad-
Bhagavatam from the professional men, can derive some material benefit as they desire, but that does not
mean that such a pretense of hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam for a week is as good as the hearing of Maharaja
Pariksit.
It is the duty of the sane to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam from a self-realized soul and not be duped by
professional men. One should continue such hearing till the end of one's life so that one can actually have
the transcendental association of the Lord and thus be liberated simply by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Maharaja Pariksit had already given up all his connections with his kingdom and family, the most
attractive features of materialism, but still he was conscious of his material body. He wanted to be free of
such bondage also by the constant association of the Lord.
