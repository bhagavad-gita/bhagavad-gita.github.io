TRANSLATION
For this reason the enlightened person should endeavor only for the minimum necessities of life while
in the world of names. He should be intelligently fixed and never endeavor for unwanted things, being
competent to perceive practically that all such endeavors are merely hard labor for nothing.
PURPORT
The bhagavata-dharma, or the cult of Srimad-Bhagavatam, is perfectly distinct from the way of fruitive
activities, which are considered by the devotees to be merely a waste of time. The whole universe, or for
that matter all material existence, is moving on as jagat, simply for planning business to make one's
position very comfortable or secure, although everyone sees that this existence is neither comfortable nor
secure and can never become comfortable or secure at any stage of development. Those who are
captivated by the illusory advancement of material civilization (following the way of phantasmagoria) are
certainly madmen. The whole material creation is a jugglery of names only; in fact, it is nothing but a
bewildering creation of matter like earth, water and fire. The buildings, furniture, cars, bungalows, mills,
factories, industries, peace, war or even the highest perfection of material science, namely atomic energy
and electronics, are all simply bewildering names of material elements with their concomitant reactions of
the three modes. Since the devotee of the Lord knows them perfectly well, he is not interested in creating
unwanted things for a situation which is not at all reality, but simply names of no more significance than
the babble of sea waves. The great kings, leaders and soldiers fight with one another in order to perpetuate
their names in history. They are forgotten in due course of time, and they make a place for another era in
history. But the devotee realizes how much history and historical persons are useless products of
flickering time. The fruitive worker aspires after a big fortune in the matter of wealth, woman and worldly
adoration, but those who are fixed in perfect reality are not at all interested in such false things. For them
it is all a waste of time. Since every second of human life is important, an enlightened man should be very
careful to utilize time very cautiously. One second of human life wasted in the vain research of planning
for happiness in the material world can never be replaced, even if one spends millions of coins of gold.
Therefore, the transcendentalist desiring freedom from the clutches of maya, or the illusory activities of
life, is warned herewith not to be captivated by the external features of fruitive actors. Human life is never
meant for sense gratification, but for self-realization. Srimad-Bhagavatam instructs us solely on this
subject from the very beginning to the end. Human life is simply meant for self-realization. The
civilization which aims at this utmost perfection never indulges in creating unwanted things, and such a
perfect civilization prepares men only to accept the bare necessities of life or to follow the principle of the
best use of a bad bargain. Our material bodies and our lives in that connection are bad bargains because
the living entity is actually spirit, and spiritual advancement of the living entity is absolutely necessary.
Human life is intended for the realization of this important factor, and one should act accordingly,
accepting only the bare necessities of life and depending more on God's gift without diversion of human
energy for any other purpose, such as being mad for material enjoyment. The materialistic advancement
of civilization is called "the civilization of the demons," which ultimately ends in wars and scarcity. The
transcendentalist is specifically warned herewith to be fixed in mind, so that even if there is difficulty in
plain living and high thinking he will not budge even an inch from his stark determination. For a
transcendentalist, it is a suicidal policy to be intimately in touch with the sense gratifiers of the world,
because such a policy will frustrate the ultimate gain of life. Sukadeva Gosvami met Maharaja Pariksit
when the latter felt a necessity for such a meeting. It is the duty of a transcendentalist to help persons who
desire real salvation and to support the cause of salvation. One might note that Sukadeva Gosvami never
met Maharaja Pariksit while he was ruling as a great king. For a transcendentalist, the mode of activities is
explained in the next sloka.
