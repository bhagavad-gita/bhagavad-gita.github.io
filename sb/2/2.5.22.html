<h2>Text</h2>
kalad guna-vyatikarah
parinamah svabhavatah
karmano janma mahatah
purusadhisthitad abhut
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kalat--from eternal time; guna-vyatikarah--transformation of the modes by reaction; parinamah--
transformation; svabhavatah--from the nature; karmanah--of activities; janma--creation; mahatah--of the
mahat-tattva; purusa-adhisthitat--because of the purusa incarnation of the Lord; abhut--it took place.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After the incarnation of the first purusa [Karanarnavasayi Visnu], the mahat-tattva, or the principles of
material creation, take place, and then time is manifested, and in course of time the three qualities appear.
Nature means the three qualitative appearances. They transform into activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By the omnipotency of the Supreme Lord, the whole material creation evolves by the process of
transformation and reactions one after another, and by the same omnipotency, they are wound up again
one after another and conserved in the body of the Supreme. Kala, or time, is the synonym of nature and
is the transformed manifestation of the principles of material creation. As such, kala may be taken as the
first cause of all creation, and by transformation of nature different activities of the material world become
visible. These activities may be taken up as the natural instinct of each and every living being, or even of
the inert objects, and after the manifestation of activities there are varieties of products and by-products of
the same nature. Originally these are all due to the Supreme Lord. The Vedanta-sutras and the
Bhagavatam thus begin with the Absolute Truth as the beginning of all creations (janmady asya yatah).
