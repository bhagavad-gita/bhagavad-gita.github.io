<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord's magnanimous pastimes and the glowing glancing of His smiling face are all indications of
His extensive benedictions. One must therefore concentrate on this transcendental form of the Lord, as
long as the mind can be fixed on Him by meditation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (12.5) it is said that the impersonalist undergoes a series of difficult programs on
account of his impersonal meditation. But the devotee, due to the Lord's personal service, progresses very
easily. Impersonal meditation is therefore a source of suffering for the impersonalist. Here, the devotee
has an advantage over the impersonalist philosopher. The impersonalist is doubtful about the personal
feature of the Lord, and therefore he always tries to meditate upon something which is not objective. For
this reason there is an authentic statement in the Bhagavatam regarding the positive concentration of the
mind on the factual form of the Lord.
The process of meditation recommended herein is bhakti-yoga, or the process of devotional service after
one is liberated from the material conditions. Jnana-yoga is the process of liberation from the material
conditions. After one is liberated from the conditions of material existence, i.e., when one is nivrtta, as
previously stated herein, or when one is freed from all material necessities, one becomes qualified to
discharge the process of bhakti-yoga. Therefore bhakti-yoga includes jnana-yoga, or, in other words, the
process of pure devotional service simultaneously serves the purpose of jnana-yoga; liberation from
material conditions is automatically achieved by the gradual development of pure devotional service.
These effects of bhakti-yoga are called anartha-nivrtti. Things which are artificially acquired gradually
disappear along with the progress of bhakti-yoga. Meditation on the lotus feet of the personality of
Godhead, the first processional step, must show its effect by anartha-nivrtti. The grossest type of anartha
which binds the conditioned soul in material existence is sex desire, and this sex desire gradually
develops in the union of the male and female. When the male and female are united, the sex desire is
further aggravated by the accumulation of buildings, children, friends, relatives and wealth. When all
these are acquired, the conditioned soul becomes overwhelmed by such entanglements, and the false
sense of egoism, or the sense of "myself" and "mine," becomes prominent, and the sex desire expands to
various political, social, altruistic, philanthropic and many other unwanted engagements, resembling the
foam of the sea waves, which becomes very prominent at one time and at the next moment vanishes as
quickly as a cloud in the sky. The conditioned soul is encircled by such products, as well as products of
sex desire, and therefore bhakti-yoga leads to gradual evaporation of the sex desire, which is summarized
in three headings, namely profit, adoration and distinction. All conditioned souls are mad after these
different forms of sex desire, and one shall see for himself how much he has been freed from such
material hankerings based primarily on the sex desire. As a person feels his hunger satisfied after eating
each morsel of foodstuff, he must similarly be able to see the degree to which he has been freed from sex
desire. The sex desire is diminished along with its various forms by the process of bhakti-yoga because
bhakti-yoga automatically, by the grace of the Lord, effectively results in knowledge and renunciation,
even if the devotee is not materially very well educated. Knowledge means knowing things as they are,
and if by deliberation it is found that there are things which are at all unnecessary, naturally the person
who has acquired knowledge leaves aside such unwanted things. When the conditioned soul finds by
culture of knowledge that material necessities are unwanted things, he becomes detached from such
unwanted things. This stage of knowledge is called vairagya, or detachment from unwanted things. We
have previously discussed that the transcendentalist is required to be self-sufficient and should not beg
from the rich blind persons to fulfill the bare necessities of life. Sukadeva Gosvami has suggested some
alternatives for the bare necessities of life, namely the problem of eating, sleeping and shelter, but he has
not suggested any alternative for sex satisfaction. One who has the sex desire still with him should not at
all try to accept the renounced order of life. For one who has not attained to this stage, there is no
question of a renounced order of life. So by the gradual process of devotional service under the guidance
of a proper spiritual master, and following the principles of the Bhagavatam, one must be able at least to
control the gross sex desire before one accepts the renounced order of life factually.
So purification means getting free gradually from sex desire, and this is attained by meditation on the
person of the Lord as described herein, beginning from the feet. One should not try to go upwards
artificially without seeing for himself how much he has been released from the sex desire. The smiling
face of the Lord is the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and there are many upstarts who at once try to
begin with the Tenth Canto and especially with the five chapters which delineate the rasa-lila of the Lord.
This is certainly improper. By such improper study or hearing of Bhagavatam, the material opportunists
have played havoc by indulgence in sex life in the name of Bhagavatam. This vilification of Bhagavatam is
rendered by the acts of the so-called devotees; one should be free from all kinds of sex desire before he
tries to make a show of recital of Bhagavatam. Sri Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura clearly defines the
import of purification as cessation from sex indulgence. He says, yatha yatha dhis ca sudhyati visayalampatyam
tyajati, tatha tatha dharayed iti citta-suddhi-taratamyenaiva dhyana-taratamyam uktam. And as
one gets free from the intoxication of sex indulgence by purification of intelligence, one should step
forward for the next meditation, or in other words, the progress of meditation on the different limbs of
the transcendental body of the Lord should be enhanced in proportion to the progress of purification of
the heart. The conclusion is that those who are still entrapped by sex indulgence should never progress to
meditation above the feet of the Lord; therefore recital of Srimad-Bhagavatam by them should be restricted
to the First and Second Cantos of the great literature. One must complete the purificatory process by
assimilating the contents of the first nine cantos. Then one should be admitted into the realm of the Tenth
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
