<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead Ramacandra, being aggrieved for His distant intimate friend [Sita], glanced
over the city of the enemy Ravana with red-hot eyes like those of Hara [who wanted to burn the kingdom
of heaven]. The great ocean, trembling in fear, gave Him His way because its family members, the aquatics
like the sharks, snakes and crocodiles, were being burnt by the heat of the angry red-hot eyes of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Personality of Godhead has every sentiment of a sentient being, like all other living beings, because
He is the chief and original living entity, the supreme source of all other living beings. He is the nitya, or
the chief eternal amongst all other eternals. He is the chief one, and all others are the dependent many.
The many eternals are supported by the one eternal, and thus both the eternals are qualitatively one. Due
to such oneness, both the eternals constitutionally have a complete range of sentiments, but the difference
is that the sentiments of the chief eternal are different in quantity from the sentiments of the dependent
eternals. When Ramacandra was angry and showed His red-hot eyes, the whole ocean became heated with
that energy, so much so that the aquatics within the great ocean felt the heat, and the personified ocean
trembled in fear and offered the Lord an easy path for reaching the enemy's city. The impersonalists will
see havoc in this red-hot sentiment of the Lord because they want to see negation in perfection. Because
the Lord is absolute, the impersonalists imagine that in the Absolute the sentiment of anger, which
resembles mundane sentiments, must be conspicuous by absence. Due to a poor fund of knowledge, they
do not realize that the sentiment of the Absolute Person is transcendental to all mundane concepts of
quality and quantity. Had Lord Ramacandra's sentiment been of mundane origin, how could it disturb the
whole ocean and its inhabitants? Can any mundane red-hot eye generate heat in the great ocean? These
are factors to be distinguished in terms of the personal and impersonal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.
As it is said in the beginning of the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Absolute Truth is the source of everything, so
the Absolute Person cannot be devoid of the sentiments that are reflected in the temporary mundane
world. Rather, the different sentiments found in the Absolute, either in anger or in mercy, have the same
qualitative influence, or, in other words, there is no mundane difference of value because these sentiments
are all on the absolute plane. Such sentiments are definitely not absent in the Absolute, as the
impersonalists think, making their mundane estimation of the transcendental world.
