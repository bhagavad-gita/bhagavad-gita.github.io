SYNONYMS
sah--He; vacya--by His forms and activities; vacakataya--by His transcendental qualities and entourage;
bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; brahma--absolute; rupa-dhrk--by accepting visible forms; nama--
name; rupa--form; kriya--pastimes; dhatte--accepts; sa-karma--engaged in work; akarmakah--without
being affected; parah--transcendence.
TRANSLATION
He, the Personality of Godhead, manifests Himself in a transcendental form, being the subject of His
transcendental name, quality, pastimes, entourage and transcendental variegatedness. Although He is
unaffected by all such activities, He appears to be so engaged.
PURPORT
Whenever there is a need of material creation, the transcendental Personality of Godhead accepts forms
in the material world for creation, maintenance and destruction. One should be intelligent enough to
know His activities in truth and not be biased to conclude that He descends to the material world by
accepting a form created by material nature. Any form accepted from the material nature has its affection
for everything done in the material world. A conditioned soul who accepts a material form for undergoing
a certain term of material activities is subjected to the laws of matter. But here in this verse it is clearly
stated that although the forms and activities of the Lord appear to be the same as those of a conditioned
soul, they are supernatural and impossible for the conditioned soul. He, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is always unaffected by such activities. In the Bhagavad-gita (4.14) the Lord says:
na mam karmani limpanti
na me karma-phale sprha
iti mam yo 'bhijanati
karmabhir na sa badhyate
The Lord is never affected by the activities which He apparently performs by His different incarnations
and personalities, nor does He have any desire to achieve success by fruitive activities. The Lord is full by
His different potencies of wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, and thus He has no
reason for physical exertion like the conditioned soul. Therefore an intelligent person who can distinguish
between the transcendental activities of the Lord and the activities of the conditioned souls is also not
bound by the reactions of activities. The Lord as Visnu, Brahma and Siva conducts the three modes of
material nature. From Visnu is born Brahma, and from Brahma is born Siva. Sometimes Brahma is a
separated part of Visnu, and sometimes Brahma is Visnu Himself. Thus Brahma creates the different
species of life all over the universe, which means that the Lord creates the whole manifestation either by
Himself or through the agency of His authorized deputies.

TRANSLATION
O King, know from me that all living entities are created by the Supreme Lord according to their past
deeds. This includes Brahma and his sons like Daksa, the periodical heads like Vaivasvata Manu, the
demigods like Indra, Candra and Varuna, the great sages like Bhrgu, Vyasa and Vasistha, the inhabitants
of Pitrloka and Siddhaloka, the Caranas, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas, Asuras, Yaksas, Kinnaras and angels,
the serpentines, the monkey-shaped Kimpurusas, the human beings, the inhabitants of Matrloka, the
demons, Pisacas, ghosts, spirits, lunatics and evil spirits, the good and evil stars, the goblins, the animals
in the forest, the birds, the household animals, the reptiles, the mountains, the moving and standing
living entities, the living entities born from embryos, from eggs, from perspiration and from seeds, and all
others, whether they be in the water, land or sky, in happiness, in distress or in mixed happiness and
distress. All of them, according to their past deeds, are created by the Supreme Lord.
PURPORT
The varieties of living entities are mentioned in this list, and, with no exception from the topmost planet
down to the lowest planet of the universe, all of them in different species of life are created by the
Almighty Father, Visnu. Therefore no one is independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
Bhagavad-gita (14.4) the Lord therefore claims all living entities as His offspring in the following verse:
sarva-yonisu kaunteya
murtayah sambhavanti yah
tasam brahma mahad yonir
aham bija-pradah pita
The material nature is compared to the mother. Although every living being is seen to come out of the
mother's body, it is still a fact that the mother is not the ultimate cause of such a birth. The father is the
ultimate cause of birth. Without the father's seed, no mother can give birth to a child. Therefore the living
beings in different varieties of forms and positions within the innumerable universes are all born of the
seeds of the Almighty Father, the Personality of Godhead, and only to the man with a poor fund of
knowledge they appear to be born of the material nature. Being under the material energy of the Supreme
Lord, all living entities beginning from Brahma down to the insignificant ant are manifested in different
bodies according to their past deeds.
The material nature is one of the energies of the Lord (Bg. 7.4). The material nature is inferior in
comparison to the living entities, the superior nature. The superior nature and inferior nature of the Lord
combine to manifest all universal affairs.
Some of the living entities are relatively happy in better conditions of life, whereas others are in
distressed conditions of life. But factually, none of them are actually happy in material conditional life. No
one can be happy in prison life, although one may be a first-class prisoner and another a third-class
prisoner. The intelligent person should not try to be promoted from third-class prison life to first-class
prison life, but should try to be released from the prison altogether. One may be promoted to first-class
prisoner, but the same first-class prisoner is again degraded to a third-class prisoner in the next term. One
should try to be free from prison life and go back home, back to Godhead. That is the real goal for all
types of living entities.
