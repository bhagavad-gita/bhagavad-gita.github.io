grivayam janaloko 'sya
tapolokah stana-dvayat
murdhabhih satyalokas tu
brahmalokah sanatanah
SYNONYMS
grivayam--up to the neck; janalokah--the Janaloka planetary system; asya--of Him; tapolokah--the
Tapoloka planetary system; stana-dvayat--beginning from the breast; murdhabhih--by the head;
satyalokah--the Satyaloka planetary system; tu--but; brahmalokah--the spiritual planets; sanatanah--
eternal.
TRANSLATION
From the forefront of the chest up to the neck of the universal form of the Lord are situated the
planetary systems named Janaloka and Tapoloka, whereas Satyaloka, the topmost planetary system, is
situated on the head of the form. The spiritual planets, however, are eternal.
PURPORT
Many times in these pages we have discussed the spiritual planets situated beyond the material sky, and
the description is corroborated in this verse. The word sanatana is significant. This very idea of eternity is
expressed in the Bhagavad-gita (8.20), where it is said that beyond the material creation is the spiritual
sky, where everything is eternal. Sometimes Satyaloka, the planet in which Brahma resides, is also called
Brahmaloka. But the Brahmaloka mentioned here is not the same as the Satyaloka planetary system. This
Brahmaloka is eternal, whereas the Satyaloka planetary system is not eternal. And to distinguish between
the two, the adjective sanatana has been used in this case. According to Srila Jiva Gosvami, this
Brahmaloka is the loka or abode of Brahman, or the Supreme Lord. In the spiritual sky all the planets are
as good as the Lord Himself. The Lord is all spirit, and His name, fame, glories, qualities, pastimes, etc.,
are all nondifferent from Him because He is absolute. As such, the planets in the kingdom of God are also
nondifferent from Him. In those planets there is no difference between the body and the soul, nor is there
any influence of time as we experience it in the material world. And in addition to there being no
influence of time, the planets in, Brahmaloka, due to being spiritual, are never annihilated. All
variegatedness in the spiritual planets is also one with the Lord, and therefore the Vedic aphorism ekam
evadvitiyam is fully realized in that sanatana atmosphere of spiritual variegatedness. This material world is
only a shadow phantasmagoria of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord, and because it is a shadow it is never
eternal; the variegatedness in the material world of duality (spirit and matter) cannot be compared to that
of the spiritual world. Because of a poor fund of knowledge, less intelligent persons sometimes mistake
the conditions of the shadow world to be equivalent to those of the spiritual world, and thus they mistake
the Lord and His pastimes in the material world to be one with the conditioned souls and their activities.
The Lord condemns such less intelligent persons in the Bhagavad-gita (9.11):
avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam
param bhavam ajananto
mama bhuta-mahesvaram
Whenever the Lord incarnates, He does so in His full internal potency (atma-maya), and less intelligent
persons mistake Him to be one of the material creations. Srila Sridhara Svami, therefore, rightly
commenting on this verse, says that the Brahmaloka mentioned here is Vaikuntha, the kingdom of God,
which is sanatana, or eternal, and is therefore not exactly like the material creations described above. The
virat universal form of the Lord is an imagination for the material world. It has nothing to do with the
spiritual world, or the kingdom of God.

TRANSLATION
My dear son Narada, know from me that there are seven lower planetary systems out of the total
fourteen. The first planetary system, known as Atala, is situated on the waist; the second, Vitala, is
situated on the thighs; the third, Sutala, on the knees; the fourth, Talatala, on the shanks; the fifth,
Mahatala, on the ankles; the sixth, Rasatala, on the upper portion of the feet; and the seventh, Patala, on
the soles of the feet. Thus the virat form of the Lord is full of all planetary systems.
PURPORT
Modern enterprisers (the astronauts who travel in space) may take information from Srimad-
Bhagavatam that in space there are fourteen divisions of planetary systems. The situation is calculated
from the earthly planetary system, which is called Bhurloka. Above Bhurloka is Bhuvarloka, and the
topmost planetary system is called Satyaloka. These are the upper seven lokas, or planetary systems. And
similarly, there are seven lower planetary systems, known as Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Mahatala,
Rasatala and Patala lokas. All these planetary systems are scattered over the complete universe, which
occupies an area of two billion times two billion square miles. The modern astronauts can travel only a
few thousand miles away from the earth, and therefore their attempt to travel in the sky is something like
child's play on the shore of an expansive ocean. The moon is situated in the third status of the upper
planetary system, and in the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam we shall be able to know the distant
situation of the various planets scattered over the vast material sky. There are innumerable universes
beyond the one in which we are put, and all these material universes cover only an insignificant portion of
the spiritual sky, which is described above as sanatana Brahmaloka. The Supreme Lord very kindly invites
the intelligent human beings to return home, back to Godhead, in the following verse of the Bhagavadgita
(8.16):
a-brahma-bhuvanal lokah
punar avartino 'rjuna
mam upetya tu kaunteya
punar janma na vidyate
Beginning from Satyaloka, the topmost planet of the universe, situated just below the eternal
Brahmaloka, as described above, all the planets are material. And one's situation in any of the many
material planets is still subject to the laws of material nature, namely birth, death, old age and disease. But
one can get complete liberation from all the above-mentioned material pangs when one enters into the
eternal Brahmaloka sanatana atmosphere, the kingdom of God. Therefore liberation, as contemplated by
the speculative philosophers and the mystics, is possible only when one becomes a devotee of the Lord.
Anyone who is not a devotee cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Only by attainment of a service
attitude in the transcendental position can one enter into the kingdom of Godhead. Therefore the
speculative philosophers, as well as the mystics, must first of all be attracted to the devotional cult before
they can factually attain liberation.
