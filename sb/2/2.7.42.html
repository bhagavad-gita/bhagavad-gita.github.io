<h2>Text</h2>
yesam sa esa bhagavan dayayed anantah
sarvatmanasrita-pado yadi nirvyalikam
te dustaram atitaranti ca deva-mayam
naisam mamaham iti dhih sva-srgala-bhaksye
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yesam--unto those only; sah--the Lord; esah--the; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; dayayet--does
bestow His mercy; anantah--the unlimited potential; sarva-atmana--by all means, without reservation;
asrita-padah--surrendered soul; yadi--if such surrender; nirvyalikam--without pretension; te--those only;
dustaram--insurmountable; atitaranti--can overcome; ca--and the paraphernalia; deva-mayam--diverse
energies of the Lord; na--not; esam--of them; mama--mine; aham--myself; iti--thus; dhih--conscious; sva--
dogs; srgala--jackals; bhaksye--in the matter of eating.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
But anyone who is specifically favored by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, due to
unalloyed surrender unto the service of the Lord, can overcome the insurmountable ocean of illusion and
can understand the Lord. But those who are attached to this body, which is meant to be eaten at the end
by dogs and jackals, cannot do so.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The unalloyed devotees of the Lord know the glories of the Lord in the sense that they can understand
how great the Lord is and how great is His expansion of diverse energy. Those who are attached to the
perishable body can hardly enter into the realm of the science of Godhead. The whole materialistic world,
based on the conception of the material body as the self, is ignorant of the science of God. The materialist
is always busy working for the welfare of the material body, not only his own but also those of his
children, kinsmen, communitymen, countrymen, etc. The materialists have many branches of
philanthropic and altruistic activities from a political, national and international angle of vision, but none
of the field work can go beyond the jurisdiction of the misconception of identifying the material body
with the spirit soul. Unless, therefore, one is saved from the wrong conception of the body and the soul,
there is no knowledge of Godhead, and unless there is knowledge of God, all advancement of material
civilization, however dazzling, should be considered a failure.
