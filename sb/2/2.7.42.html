adyo 'vatarah purusah parasya
kalah svabhavah sad-asan-manas ca
dravyam vikaro guna indriyani
virat svarat sthasnu carisnu bhumnah
SYNONYMS
adyah--first; avatarah--incarnation; purusah--Karanarnavasayi Visnu; parasya--of the Lord; kalah--time;
svabhavah--space; sat--result; asat--cause; manah--mind; ca--also; dravyam--elements; vikarah--material
ego; gunah--modes of nature; indriyani--senses; virat--the complete whole body; svarat--Garbhodakasayi
Visnu; sthasnu--immovable; carisnu--movable; bhumnah--of the Supreme Lord.
TRANSLATION
Karanarnavasayi Visnu is the first incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and He is the master of eternal time,
space, cause and effects, mind, the elements, the material ego, the modes of nature, the senses, the
universal form of the Lord, Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and the sum total of all living beings, both moving and
nonmoving.
PURPORT
That the material creation is not permanent has been discussed many times hereinbefore. The material
creation is but a temporary exhibition of the material energy of the Almighty God. This material
manifestation is necessary to give a chance to the conditioned souls who are unwilling to associate with
the Lord in the relationship of loving transcendental service. Such unwilling conditioned souls are not
allowed to enter into the liberated life of spiritual existence because at heart they are not willing to serve.
Instead, they want to enjoy themselves as imitation Gods. The living entities are constitutionally eternal
servitors of the Lord, but some of them, because of misusing their independence, do not wish to serve;
therefore they are allowed to enjoy the material nature, which is called maya, or illusion. It is called
illusion because the living beings under the clutches of maya are not factually enjoyers, although they
think that they are, being illusioned by maya. Such illusioned living entities are given a chance at intervals
to rectify their perverted mentality of becoming false masters of the material nature, and they are imparted
lessons from the Vedas about their eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna (vedais ca sarvair
aham eva vedyah). So the temporary creation of the material manifestation is an exhibition of the material
energy of the Lord, and to manage the whole show the Supreme Lord incarnates Himself as the
Karanarnavasayi Visnu just as a magistrate is deputed by the government to manage affairs temporarily.
This Karanodakasayi Visnu causes the manifestation of material creation by looking over His material
energy (sa aiksata). In the first volume of this book we have already discussed to some extent the
explanation of the verse jagrhe paurusam rupam. The duration of the illusory play of material creation is
called a kalpa, and we have already discussed the creation's taking place in kalpa after kalpa. By His
incarnation and potential activities, the complete ingredients of creation, namely time, space, cause,
result, mind, the gross and subtle elements and their interactional modes of nature--goodness, passion
and ignorance--and then the senses and their reservoir source, the gigantic universal form as the second
incarnation Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and all living beings, both moving and standing, which come out of
the second incarnation, all became manifested. Ultimately, all these creative elements and the creation
itself are but potential manifestations of the Supreme Lord; nothing is independent of the control of the
Supreme Being. This first incarnation in the material creation, namely Karanarnavasayi Visnu, is the
plenary part of the original Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, described in the Brahma-samhita (5.48) as
follows:
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
All the innumerable universes are maintained only during the breathing period of Maha-Visnu, or
Karanarnavasayi Visnu, who is only a plenary part of Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead Lord
Krsna.

TRANSLATION
I myself [Brahma], Lord Siva, Lord Visnu, great generators of living beings like Daksa and Prajapati,
yourselves [Narada and the Kumaras], heavenly demigods like Indra and Candra, the leaders of the
Bhurloka planets, the leaders of the earthly planets, the leaders of the lower planets, the leaders of the
Gandharva planets, the leaders of the Vidyadhara planets, the leaders of the Caranaloka planets, the
leaders of the Yaksas, Raksas and Uragas, the great sages, the great demons, the great atheists and the
great spacemen, as well as the dead bodies, evil spirits, satans, jinn, kusmandas, great aquatics, great
beasts and great birds, etc.--in other words, anything and everything which is exceptionally possessed of
power, opulence, mental and perceptual dexterity, strength, forgiveness, beauty, modesty, opulence, and
breeding, whether in form or formless--may appear to be the specific truth and the form of the Lord, but
actually they are not so. They are only a fragment of the transcendental potency of the Lord.
PURPORT
Those in the list given above, beginning from the name Brahmaji, the first living creature within the
universe, down to Lord Siva, Lord Visnu, Narada and other powerful demigods, men, supermen, sages,
rsis, and other lower creatures of extraordinary strength and opulence, including the dead bodies, satans,
evil spirits, jinn, aquatics, birds and beasts, may appear to be the Supreme Lord, but factually none of
them is the Supreme Lord; every one of them possesses only a fragment of the great potencies of the
Supreme Lord. The less intelligent man is surprised to see the wonderful actions of material phenomena,
as the aborigines are fearful of a great thunderbolt, a great and gigantic banyan tree, or a great lofty
mountain in the jungle. For such undeveloped human beings, merely the slight display of the Lord's
potency is captivating. A still more advanced person is captivated by the powers of the demigods and
goddesses. Therefore, those who are simply astonished by the powers of anything in the creation of the
Lord, without any factual information of the Lord Himself, are known as saktas, or worshipers of the great
powers. The modern scientist is also captivated by the wonderful actions and reactions of natural
phenomena and therefore is also a sakta. These lower-grade persons gradually rise to become sauriyas
(worshipers of the sun-god) or ganapatyas (worshipers of the mass of people as janata janardana or
daridra-narayana, etc., in the form of Ganapati) and then rise to the platform of worshiping Lord Siva in
search for the ever-existing soul, and then to the stage of worshiping Lord Visnu, the Supersoul, etc.,
without any information of Govinda, Lord Krsna, who is the original Lord Visnu. In other ways some are
worshipers of race, nationality, birds, beasts, evil spirits, satans, etc. The general worship of Sanideva, the
lord of distressful condition, and Sitaladevi, the goddess of smallpox, is also common to the mass of
people, and there are many foolish men who worship the mass of people or the poor class of men. So
different persons, societies and communities, etc., worship some of the potent manifestations of the Lord,
wrongly accepting the powerful object as God. But in this verse it is advised by Brahmaji that none of
them is the Supreme Lord; they are only borrowed plumes from the original Almighty Lord Sri Krsna.
When the Lord advises in Bhagavad-gita to worship Him alone, it is to be understood that worshiping
Lord Krsna includes worshiping all that is mentioned, because He, Lord Krsna, includes everyone.
When the Lord is described as formless in the Vedic literatures, it is to be understood that all these
forms mentioned above, within the experience of universal knowledge, are different exhibitions of the
Lord's transcendental potencies only, and none of them factually represents the transcendental form of the
Lord. But when the Lord actually descends on the earth or anywhere within the universe, the less
intelligent class of men also mistake Him to be one of them, and thus they imagine the Transcendence to
be formless or impersonal. Factually, the Lord is not formless, nor does He belong to any of the
multiforms experienced within the universal forms. One should try to know the truth about the Lord by
following the instruction of Brahmaji.
