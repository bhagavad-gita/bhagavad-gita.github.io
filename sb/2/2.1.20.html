<h2>Text</h2>
rajas-tamobhyam aksiptam
vimudham mana atmanah
yacched dharanaya dhiro
hanti ya tat-krtam malam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rajah--the passionate mode of nature; tamobhyam--as well as by the ignorant mode of material nature;
aksiptam--agitated; vimudham--bewildered; manah--the mind; atmanah--of one's own; yacchet--get it
rectified; dharanaya--by conception (of Visnu); dhirah--the pacified; hanti--destroys; ya--all those; tatkrtam--
done by them; malam--dirty things.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One's mind is always agitated by the passionate mode of material nature and bewildered by the ignorant
mode of nature. But one can rectify such conceptions by the relation of Visnu and thus become pacified
by cleansing the dirty things created by them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Persons generally conducted by the modes of passion and ignorance cannot be bona fide candidates for
being situated in the transcendental stage of God realization. Only persons conducted by the mode of
goodness can have the knowledge of the Supreme Truth. Effects of the modes of passion and ignorance
are manifested by too much hankering after wealth and women. And those who are too much after wealth
and women can rectify their leanings only by constant remembrance of Visnu in His potential impersonal
feature. Generally the impersonalists or monists are influenced by the modes of passion and ignorance.
Such impersonalists think of themselves as liberated souls, but they have no knowledge of the
transcendental personal feature of the Absolute Truth. Actually they are impure in heart on account of
being devoid of knowledge of the personal feature of the Absolute. In the Bhagavad-gita, it is said that
after many hundreds of births, the impersonal philosopher surrenders unto the Personality of Godhead.
To acquire such a qualification of God realization in the personal feature, the neophyte impersonalist is
given a chance to realize the relation of the Lord in everything by the philosophy of pantheism.
Pantheism in its higher status does not permit the student to form an impersonal conception of the
Absolute Truth, but it extends the conception of the Absolute Truth into the field of the so-called material
energy. Everything created by the material energy can be dovetailed with the Absolute by an attitude of
service, which is the essential part of living energy. The pure devotee of the Lord knows the art of
converting everything into its spiritual existence by this service attitude, and only in that devotional way
can the theory of pantheism be perfected.
