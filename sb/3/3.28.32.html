<h2>Translation</h2>
Better than the brahmana who knows the purpose of the Vedas is he who can dissipate all doubts, and
better than him is one who strictly follows the brahminical principles. Better than him is one who is
liberated from all material contamination, and better than him is a pure devotee, who executes devotional
service without expectation of reward.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Artha jna brahmana refers to one who has made a thorough analytical study of the Absolute Truth and
who knows that the Absolute Truth is realized in three different phases, namely Brahman, Paramatma and
Bhagavan. If someone not only has this knowledge but is able to clear all doubts if questioned about the
Absolute Truth, he is considered better. Further, there may be a learned brahmana-Vaisnava who can
explain clearly and eradicate all doubts, but if he does not follow the Vaisnava principles, then he is not
situated on a higher level. One must be able to clear all doubts and simultaneously be situated in the
brahminical characteristics. Such a person, who knows the purpose of the Vedic injunctions, who can
employ the principles laid down in the Vedic literatures and who teaches his disciples in that way, is
called an acarya. The position of an acarya is that he executes devotional service with no desire for
elevation to a higher position of life.
The highest perfectional brahmana is the Vaisnava. A Vaisnava who knows the science of the Absolute
Truth but is not able to preach such knowledge to others is described as being in the lower stage, one who
not only understands the principles of the science of God but can also preach is in the second stage, and
one who not only can preach but who also sees everything in the Absolute Truth and the Absolute Truth
in everything is in the highest class of Vaisnavas. It is mentioned here that a Vaisnava is already a
brahmana; in fact, the highest stage of brahminical perfection is reached when one becomes a Vaisnava.
