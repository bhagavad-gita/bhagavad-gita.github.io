<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
rupam--form; tava--Your; etat--this; nanu--but; duskrta-atmanam--of souls who are simply miscreants;
durdarsanam--very difficult to see; deva--O Lord; yat--that; adhvara-atmakam--worshipable by
performances of sacrifice; chandamsi--the Gayatri mantra and others; yasya--whose; tvaci--touch of the
skin; barhih--sacred grass called kusa; romasu--hairs on the body; ajyam--clarified butter; drsi--in the

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, Your form is worshipable by performances of sacrifice, but souls who are simply miscreants are
unable to see it. All the Vedic hymns, Gayatri and others, are in the touch of Your skin. In Your bodily
hairs is the kusa grass, in Your eyes is the clarified butter, and in Your four legs are the four kinds of
fruitive activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a class of miscreants who are known in the words of Bhagavad-gita as veda-vadi, or so-called
strict followers of the Vedas. They do not believe in the incarnation of the Lord, what to speak of the
Lord's incarnation as the worshipable hog. They describe worship of the different forms or incarnations of
the Lord as anthropomorphism. In the estimation of Srimad-Bhagavatam these men are miscreants, and in
Bhagavad-gita (7.15) they are called not only miscreants but also fools and the lowest of mankind, and it
is said that their knowledge has been plundered by illusion due to their atheistic temperament. For such
condemned persons, the Lord's incarnation as the gigantic hog is invisible. These strict followers of the
Vedas who despise the eternal forms of the Lord may know from Srimad-Bhagavatam that such
incarnations are personified forms of the Vedas. Lord Boar's skin, His eyes and His bodily hair holes are
all described here as different parts of the Vedas. He is therefore the personified form of the Vedic hymns,
and specifically the Gayatri mantra.
