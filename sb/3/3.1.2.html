<h2>Text</h2>
yad va ayam mantra-krd vo
bhagavan akhilesvarah
pauravendra-grham hitva
pravivesatmasat krtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--the house; vai--what else is there to say; ayam--Sri Krsna; mantra-krt--minister; vah--you people;
bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; akhila-isvarah--the Lord of everything; pauravendra--Duryodhana;
grham--house; hitva--giving up; pravivesa--entered; atmasat--identify with oneself; krtam--so accepted.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What else is there to say about the residential house of the Pandavas? Sri Krsna, the Lord of everything,
acted as your minister. He used to enter that house as if it were His own, and He did not take any care of
Duryodhana's house.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Gaudiya acintya-bhedabheda-tattva philosophy, anything which satisfies the senses of
the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna, is also Sri Krsna. For example, Sri Vrndavana-dhama is nondifferent from Sri
Krsna (tad-dhama vrndavanam) because at Vrndavana the Lord enjoys the transcendental bliss of His
internal potency. Similarly, the house of the Pandavas was also the source of transcendental bliss for the
Lord. It is mentioned here that the Lord identified the house with His own Self. Thus the house of the
Pandavas was as good as Vrndavana, and Vidura should not have given up that place of transcendental
bliss. Therefore the reason for his quitting the house was not exactly family misunderstanding; rather,
Vidura took the opportunity to meet Rsi Maitreya and discuss transcendental knowledge. For a saintly
person like Vidura, any disturbance due to worldly affairs is insignificant. Such disturbances, however, are
sometimes favorable for higher realization, and therefore Vidura took advantage of a family
misunderstanding in order to meet Maitreya Rsi.
