<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus being pierced by arrows through his ears and afflicted to the core of his heart, Vidura placed his
bow on the door and quit his brother's palace. He was not sorry, for he considered the acts of the external
energy to be supreme.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee of the Lord is never perturbed by an awkward position created by the external energy of
the Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (3.27) it is stated:
prakrteh kriyamanani
gunaih karmani sarvasah
ahankara-vimudhatma
kartaham iti manyate
A conditioned soul is absorbed in material existence under the influence of different modes of external
energy. Absorbed in the false ego, he thinks that he is doing everything by himself. The external energy of
the Lord, the material nature, is fully under the control of the Supreme Lord, and the conditioned soul is
fully under the grip of the external energy. Therefore, the conditioned soul is fully under the control of
the law of the Lord. But, due to illusion only, he thinks himself independent in his activities. Duryodhana
was acting under such influence of the external nature, by which he would be vanquished at the ultimate
end. He could not accept the sound advice of Vidura, but on the contrary he insulted that great soul, who
was the well-wisher of his whole family. Vidura could understand this because he was a pure devotee of
the Lord. In spite of being very strongly insulted by Duryodhana's words, Vidura could see that
Duryodhana, under the influence of maya, the external energy, was making progress on the path toward
his own ruination. He therefore considered the acts of the external energy to be supreme, yet he also saw
how the internal energy of the Lord helped him in that particular situation. A devotee is always in a
renounced temperament because the worldly attractions can never satisfy him. Vidura was never attracted
by the royal palace of his brother. He was always ready to leave the place and devote himself completely to
the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Now he got the opportunity by the grace of Duryodhana,
and instead of being sorry at the strong words of insult, he thanked him from within because it gave him
the chance to live alone in a holy place and fully engage in the devotional service of the Lord. The word
gata-vyathah (without being sorry) is significant here because Vidura was relieved from the tribulations
which trouble every man entangled in material activities. He therefore thought that there was no need to
defend his brother with his bow because his brother was meant for ruination. Thus he left the palace
before Duryodhana could act. Maya, the supreme energy of the Lord, acted here both internally and
externally.
