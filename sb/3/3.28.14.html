<h2>Translation</h2>
By attaining the highest platform of devotional service, as I have explained, one can overcome the
influence of the three modes of material nature and be situated in the transcendental stage, as is the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sripada Sankaracarya, who is supposed to be the leader of the impersonalist school of philosophers, has
admitted in the beginning of his comments on Bhagavad-gita that Narayana, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is beyond the material creation; except for Him, everything is within the material creation. It is
also confirmed in the Vedic literature that before the creation there was only Narayana; neither Lord
Brahma nor Lord Siva existed. Only Narayana, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, or Krsna, is
always in the transcendental position, beyond the influence of material creation.
The material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance cannot affect the position of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; therefore He is called nirguna (free from all tinges of material qualities). Here the
same fact is confirmed by Lord Kapila: one who is situated in pure devotional service is transcendentally
situated, as is the Lord. Just as the Lord is unaffected by the influence of the material modes, so too are
His pure devotees. One who is not affected by the three modes of material nature is called a liberated soul,
or brahma-bhuta soul. Brahma-bhutah prasannatma is the stage of liberation. Aham brahmasmi: "I am not
this body." This is applicable only to the person who constantly engages in the devotional service of Krsna
and is thus in the transcendental stage; he is above the influence of the three modes of material nature.
It is the misconception of the impersonalists that one can worship any imaginary form of the Lord, or
Brahman, and at the end merge in the Brahman effulgence. Of course, to merge into the bodily effulgence
(Brahman) of the Supreme Lord is also liberation, as explained in the previous verse. Ekatva is also
liberation, but that sort of liberation is never accepted by any devotee, for qualitative oneness is
immediately attained as soon as one is situated in devotional service. For a devotee, that qualitative
equality, which is the result of impersonal liberation, is already attained; he does not have to try for it
separately. It is clearly stated here that simply by pure devotional service one becomes qualitatively as
good as the Lord Himself.
