<h2>Text</h2>
taijasanindriyany eva

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
taijasani--produced from egoism in the mode of passion; indriyani--the senses; eva--certainly; kriya--
action; jnana--knowledge; vibhagasah--according to; pranasya--of the vital energy; hi--indeed; kriyasaktih--
the senses of action; buddheh--of the intelligence; vijnana-saktita--the senses for acquiring
knowledge.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Egoism in the mode of passion produces two kinds of senses--the senses for acquiring knowledge and
the senses of action. The senses of action depend on the vital energy, and the senses for acquiring
knowledge depend on intelligence.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has been explained in the previous verses that mind is the product of ego in goodness and that the
function of the mind is acceptance and rejection according to desire. But here intelligence is said to be the
product of ego in passion. That is the distinction between mind and intelligence; mind is a product of
egoism in goodness, and intelligence is a product of egoism in passion. The desire to accept something
and reject something is a very important factor of the mind. Since mind is a product of the mode of
goodness, if it is fixed upon the Lord of the mind, Aniruddha, then the mind can be changed to Krsna
consciousness. It is stated by Narottama dasa Thakura that we always have desires. Desire cannot be
stopped. But if we transfer our desires to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the perfection
of life. As soon as the desire is transferred to lording it over material nature, it becomes contaminated by
matter. Desire has to be purified. In the beginning, this purification process has to be carried out by the
order of the spiritual master, since the spiritual master knows how the disciple's desires can be
transformed into Krsna consciousness. As far as intelligence is concerned, it is clearly stated here that it is
a product of egoism in passion. By practice one comes to the point of the mode of goodness, and by
surrendering or fixing the mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one becomes a very great
personality, or mahatma. In Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said, sa mahatma sudurlabhah: "Such a great soul is
very rare."
In this verse it is clear that both kinds of senses, the senses for acquiring knowledge and the senses for
action, are products of egoism in the mode of passion. And because the sense organs for activity and for
acquiring knowledge require energy, the vital energy, or life energy, is also produced by egoism in the
mode of passion. We can actually see, therefore, that those who are very passionate can improve in
material acquisition very quickly. It is recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants to
encourage a person in acquiring material possessions, one should also encourage him in sex life. We
naturally find that those who are addicted to sex life are also materially advanced because sex life or
passionate life is the impetus for the material advancement of civilization. For those who want to make
spiritual advancement, there is almost no existence of the mode of passion. Only the mode of goodness is
prominent. We find that those who engage in Krsna consciousness are materially poor, but one who has
eyes can see who is the greater. Although he appears to be materially poor, a person in Krsna
consciousness is not actually a poor man, but the person who has no taste tor Krsna consciousness and
appears to be very happy with material possessions is actually poor. Persons infatuated by material
consciousness are very intelligent in discovering things for material comforts, but they have no access to
understanding the spirit soul and spiritual life. Therefore, if anyone wants to advance in spiritual life, he
has to come back to the platform of purified desire, the purified desire for devotional service. As stated in
the Narada-pancaratra, engagement in the service of the Lord when the senses are purified in Krsna
consciousness is called pure devotion.
