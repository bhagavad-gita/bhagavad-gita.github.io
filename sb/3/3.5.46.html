<h2>Text</h2>
panena te deva katha-sudhayah
pravrddha-bhaktya visadasaya ye
vairagya-saram pratilabhya bodham
yathanjasanviyur akuntha-dhisnyam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
panena--by drinking; te--of You; deva--O Lord; katha--topics; sudhayah--of the nectar; pravrddha--
highly enlightened; bhaktya--by devotional service; visada-asayah--with a greatly serious attitude; ye--
those who; vairagya-saram--the entire purport of renunciation; pratilabhya--achieving; bodham--
intelligence; yatha--as much as; anjasa--quickly; anviyuh--achieve; akuntha-dhisnyam--Vaikunthaloka in
the spiritual sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, persons who, because of their serious attitude, attain the stage of enlightened devotional service
achieve the complete meaning of renunciation and knowledge and attain the Vaikunthaloka in the
spiritual sky simply by drinking the nectar of Your topics.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The difference between the impersonalistic mental speculators and the pure devotees of the Lord is that
the former pass through a miserable understanding of the Absolute Truth at every stage, whereas the
devotees enter into the kingdom of all pleasures even from the beginning of their attempt. The devotee
has only to hear about devotional activities, which are as simple as anything in ordinary life, and he also
acts very simply, whereas the mental speculator has to pass through a jugglery of words, which are
partially facts and partially a make-show for the maintenance of an artificial impersonal status. In spite of
his strenuous efforts to attain perfect knowledge, the impersonalist attains merging into the impersonal
oneness of the brahmajyoti of the Lord, which is also attained by the enemies of the Lord simply because
of their being killed by Him. The devotees, however, attain to the highest stage of knowledge and
renunciation and achieve the Vaikunthalokas, the planets in the spiritual sky. The impersonalist attains
only the sky, and does not achieve any tangible transcendental bliss, whereas the devotee attains to the
planets where real spiritual life prevails. With a serious attitude, the devotee throws away all achievements
like so much dust, and he accepts only devotional service, the transcendental culmination.
