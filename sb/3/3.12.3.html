<h2>Text</h2>
drstva papiyasim srstim
natmanam bahv amanyata
bhagavad-dhyana-putena
manasanyam tato 'srjat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
drstva--by seeing; papiyasim--sinful; srstim--creation; na--did not; atmanam--unto Himself; bahu--much
pleasure; amanyata--felt; bhagavat--on the Personality of Godhead; dhyana--meditation; putena--purified
by that; manasa--by such a mentality; anyam--another; tatah--thereafter; asrjat--created.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Seeing such a misleading creation as a sinful task, Brahma did not feel much pleasure in his activity, and
therefore he purified himself by meditation on the Personality of Godhead. Then he began another term of
creation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although he created the different influences of nescience, Lord Brahma was not satisfied in performing
such a thankless task, but he had to do it because most of the conditioned souls wanted it to be so. Lord
Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15) that He is present in everyone's heart and is helping everyone to
either remember of forget. The question may be raised why the Lord, who is all-merciful, helps one to
remember and another to forget. Actually, His mercy is not exhibited in partiality towards one and enmity
towards another. The living entity, as part and parcel of the Lord, is partially independent because he
partially possesses all the qualities of the Lord. Anyone who has some independence may sometimes
misuse it due to ignorance. When the living entity prefers to misuse his independence and glide down
towards nescience, the all-merciful Lord first of all tries to protect him from the trap, but when the living
entity persists in gliding down to hell, the Lord helps him to forget his real position. The Lord helps the
falling living entity glide down to the lowest point, just to give him the chance to see if he is happy by
misusing his independence.
Almost all the conditioned souls who are rotting in the material world are misusing their independence,
and therefore five kinds of nescience are imposed upon them. As an obedient servitor of the Lord, Brahma
creates all these as a matter of necessity, but he is not happy in doing so because a devotee of the Lord
naturally does not like to see anyone falling down from his real position. Persons who do not care for the
path of realization get full facilities from the Lord for executing their proclivities to the fullest extent, and
Brahma helps in that procedure without fail.
