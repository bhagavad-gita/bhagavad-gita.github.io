<h2>Text</h2>
tatrapi sparsa-vedibhyah
pravara rasa-vedinah
tebhyo gandha-vidah sresthas
tatah sabda-vido varah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--among them; api--moreover; sparsa-vedibhyah--than those perceiving touch; pravarah--better;
rasa-vedinah--those perceiving taste; tebhyah--than them; gandha-vidah--those perceiving smell;
sresthah--better; tatah--than them; sabda-vidah--those perceiving sound; varah--better.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Among the living entities who have developed sense perception, those who have developed the sense of
taste are better than those who have developed only the sense of touch. Better than them are those who
have developed the sense of smell, and better still are those who have developed the sense of hearing.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although Westerners accept that Darwin first expounded the doctrine of evolution, the science of
anthropology is not new. The development of the evolutionary process was known long before from the
Bhagavatam, which was written five thousand years ago. There are records of the statements of Kapila
Muni, who was present almost in the beginning of the creation. This knowledge has existed since the
Vedic time, and all these sequences are disclosed in Vedic literature; the theory of gradual evolution or
anthropology is not new to the Vedas.
It is said here that amongst the trees there are also evolutionary processes; the different kinds of trees
have touch perception. It is said that better than the trees are the fish because fish have developed the
sense of taste. Better than the fish are the bees, who have developed the sense of smell, and better than
them are the serpents because serpents have developed the sense of hearing. In the darkness of night a
snake can find its eatables simply by hearing the frog's very pleasant cry. The snake can understand,
"There is the frog," and he captures the frog simply because of its sound vibration. This example is
sometimes given for persons who vibrate sounds simply for death. One may have a very nice tongue that
can vibrate sound like the frogs, but that kind of vibration is simply calling death. The best use of the
tongue and of sound vibration is to chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama,
Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. That will protect one from the hands of cruel death.
