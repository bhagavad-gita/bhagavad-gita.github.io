<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, today please give away your daughters to the foremost of the sages, with due regard for the
girls' temperaments and likings, and thereby spread your fame all over the universe.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The nine principal rsis, or sages, are Marici, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhrgu, Vasistha and
Atharva. All these rsis are most important, and Brahma desired that the nine daughters already born of
Kardama Muni be handed over to them. Here two words are used very significantly--yatha-silam and
yatha-ruci. The daughters should be handed over to the respective rsis, not blindly, but according to the
combination of character and taste. That is the art of combining a man and woman. Man and woman
should not be united simply on the consideration of sex life. There are many other considerations,
especially character and taste. If the taste and character differ between the man and woman, their
combination will be unhappy. Even about forty years ago, in Indian marriages, the taste and character of
the boy and girl were first of all matched, and then they were allowed to marry. This was done under the
direction of the respective parents. The parents used to astrologically determine the character and tastes of
the boy and girl, and when they corresponded, the match was selected: "This girl and this boy are just
suitable, and they should be married." Other considerations were less important. The same system was
also advised in the beginning of the creation by Brahma: "Your daughters should be handed over to the
rsis according to taste and character."
According to astrological calculation, a person is classified according to whether he belongs to the godly
or demoniac quality. In that way the spouse was selected. A girl of godly quality should be handed over to
a boy of godly quality. A girl of demoniac quality should be handed over to a boy of demoniac quality.
Then they will be happy. But if the girl is demoniac and the boy is godly, then the combination is
incompatible; they cannot be happy in such a marriage. At the present moment, because boys and girls are
not married according to quality and character, most marriages are unhappy, and there is divorce.
It is foretold in the Twelfth Canto of the Bhagavatam that in this age of Kali married life will be accepted
on the consideration of sex only; when the boy and girl are pleased in sex, they get married, and when
there is deficiency in sex, they separate. That is not actual marriage, but a combination of men and
women like cats and dogs. Therefore, the children produced in the modern age are not exactly human
beings. Human beings must be twice-born. A child is first born of a good father and mother, and then he
is born again of the spiritual master and the Vedas. The first mother and father bring about his birth into
the world; then the spiritual master and the Vedas become his second father and mother. According to the
Vedic system of marriage for producing children, every man and woman was enlightened in spiritual
knowledge, and at the time of their combination to produce a child, everything was scrutinizingly and
scientifically done.
