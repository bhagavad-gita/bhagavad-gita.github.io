<h2>Text</h2>
jnanena drsta-tattvena
vairagyena baliyasa
tapo-yuktena yogena
tivrenatma-samadhina
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jnanena--in knowledge; drsta-tattvena--with vision of the Absolute Truth; vairagyena--with
renunciation; baliyasa--very strong; tapah-yuktena--by engagement in austerity; yogena--by mystic yoga;
tivrena--firmly fixed; atma-samadhina--by self-absorption.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This devotional service has to be performed strongly in perfect knowledge and with transcendental
vision. One must be strongly renounced and must engage in austerity and perform mystic yoga in order to
be firmly fixed in self-absorption.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devotional service in Krsna consciousness cannot be performed blindly due to material emotion or
mental concoction. It is specifically mentioned here that one has to perform devotional service in full
knowledge by visualizing the Absolute Truth. We can understand about the Absolute Truth by evolving
transcendental knowledge, and the result of such transcendental knowledge will be manifested by
renunciation. That renunciation is not temporary or artificial, but is very strong. It is said that
development of Krsna consciousness is exhibited by proportionate material detachment, or vairagya. If
one does not separate himself from material enjoyment, it is to be understood that he is not advancing in
Krsna consciousness. Renunciation in Krsna consciousness is so strong that it cannot be deviated by any
attractive illusion. One has to perform devotional service in full tapasya, austerity. One should fast on the
two Ekadasi days, which fall on the eleventh day of the waxing and waning moon, and on the birthdays of
Lord Krsna, Lord Rama and Caitanya Mahaprabhu. There are many such fasting days. Yogena means "by
controlling the senses and mind." Yoga indriya-samyamah. Yogena implies that one is seriously absorbed
in the self and is able, by development of knowledge, to understand his constitutional position in
relationship with the Superself. In this way one becomes fixed in devotional service, and his faith cannot
be shaken by any material allurement.
