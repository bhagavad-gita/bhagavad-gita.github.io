svacchatvam avikaritvam
santatvam iti cetasah
vrttibhir laksanam proktam
yathapam prakrtih para
SYNONYMS
svacchatvam--clarity; avikaritvam--freedom from all distraction; santatvam--serenity; iti--thus; cetasah--
of consciousness; vrttibhih--by characteristics; laksanam--traits; proktam--called; yatha--as; apam--of
water; prakrtih--natural state; para--pure.
TRANSLATION
After the manifestation of the mahat-tattva, these features appear simultaneously. As water in its natural
state, before coming in contact with earth, is clear, sweet and unruffled, so the characteristic traits of pure
consciousness are complete serenity, clarity, and freedom from distraction.
PURPORT
The pure status of consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, exists in the beginning; just after creation,
consciousness is not polluted. The more one becomes materially contaminated, however, the more
consciousness becomes obscured. In pure consciousness one can perceive a slight reflection of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As in clear, unagitated water, free from impurities, one can see
everything clearly, so in pure consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, one can see things as they are. One
can see the reflection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one can see his own existence as well.
This state of consciousness is very pleasing, transparent and sober. In the beginning, consciousness is
pure.
TEXTS 23-24

bhagavad-virya-sambhavat
kriya-saktir ahankaras
tri-vidhah samapadyata
vaikarikas taijasas ca
tamasas ca yato bhavah
manasas cendriyanam ca
bhutanam mahatam api
SYNONYMS
mahat-tattvat--from the mahat-tattva; vikurvanat--undergoing a change; bhagavat-virya-sambhavat--
evolved from the Lord's own energy; kriya-saktih--endowed with active power; ahankarah--the material
ego; tri-vidhah--of the three kinds; samapadyata--sprang up; vaikarikah--material ego in transformed
goodness; taijasah--material ego in passion; ca--and; tamasah--material ego in ignorance; ca--also; yatah--
from which; bhavah--the origin; manasah--of the mind; ca--and; indriyanam--of the senses for perception
and action; ca--and; bhutanam mahatam--of the five gross elements; api--also.
TRANSLATION
The material ego springs up from the mahat-tattva, which evolved from the Lord's own energy. The
material ego is endowed predominantly with active power of three kinds--good, passionate and ignorant.
It is from these three types of material ego that the mind, the senses of perception, the organs of action,
and the gross elements evolve.
PURPORT
In the beginning, from clear consciousness, or the pure state of Krsna consciousness, the first
contamination sprang up. This is called false ego, or identification of the body as self. The living entity
exists in the natural state of Krsna consciousness, but he has marginal independence, and this allows him
to forget Krsna. Originally, pure Krsna consciousness exists, but because of misuse of marginal
independence there is a chance of forgetting Krsna. This is exhibited in actual life; there are many
instances in which someone acting in Krsna consciousness suddenly changes. In the Upanisads it is
stated, therefore, that the path of spiritual realization is just like the sharp edge of a razor. The example is
very appropriate. One shaves his cheeks with a sharp razor very nicely, but as soon as his attention is
diverted from the activity, he immediately cuts his cheek because he mishandles the razor.
Not only must one come to the stage of pure Krsna consciousness, but one must also be very careful.
Any inattentiveness or carelessness may cause falldown. This falldown is due to false ego. From the status
of pure consciousness, the false ego is born because of misuse of independence. We cannot argue about
why false ego arises from pure consciousness. Factually, there is always the chance that this will happen,
and therefore one has to be very careful. False ego is the basic principle for all material activities, which
are executed in the modes of material nature. As soon as one deviates from pure Krsna consciousness, he
increases his entanglement in material reaction. The entanglement of materialism is the material mind,
and from this material mind, the senses and material organs become manifest.
