<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
tad asya samsrtir bandhah
para-tantryam ca tat-krtam
bhavaty akartur isasya
saksino nirvrtatmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--from the misconception; asya--of the conditioned soul; samsrtih--conditioned life; bandhah--
bondage; para-tantryam--dependence; ca--and; tat-krtam--made by that; bhavati--is; akartuh--of the
nondoer; isasya--independent; saksinah--the witness; nirvrta-atmanah--joyful by nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Material consciousness is the cause of one's conditional life, in which conditions are enforced upon the
living entity by the material energy. Although the spirit soul does not do anything and is transcendental to
such activities, he is thus affected by conditional life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Mayavadi philosopher, who does not differentiate between the Supreme Spirit and the individual
spirit, says that the conditional existence of the living entity is his lila, or pastime. But the word "pastime"
implies employment in the activities of the Lord. The Mayavadis misuse the word and say that even if the
living entity has become a stool-eating hog, he is also enjoying his pastimes. This is a most dangerous
interpretation. Actually the Supreme Lord is the leader and maintainer of all living entities. His pastimes
are transcendental to any material activity. Such pastimes of the Lord cannot be dragged to the level of the
conditional activities of the living entities. In conditional life the living entity actually remains as if a
captive in the hands of material energy. Whatever the material energy dictates, the conditioned soul does.
He has no responsibility; he is simply the witness of the action, but he is forced to act in that way due to
his offense in his eternal relationship with Krsna. Lord Krsna therefore says in Bhagavad-gita that maya,
His material energy, is so forceful that it is insurmountable. But if a living entity simply understands that
his constitutional position is to serve Krsna and he tries to act on this principle, then however conditioned
he may be, the influence of maya immediately vanishes. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh
Chapter: Krsna takes charge of anyone who surrenders to Him in helplessness, and thus the influence of
maya, or conditional life, is removed.
The spirit soul is actually sac-cid-ananda--eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge. Under the clutches
of maya, however, he suffers from continued birth, death, disease and old age. One has to be serious to
cure this condition of material existence and transfer himself to Krsna consciousness, for thus his long
suffering may be mitigated without difficulty. In summary, the suffering of the conditioned soul is due to
his attachment to material nature. This attachment should thus be transferred from matter to Krsna.
