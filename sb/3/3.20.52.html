<h2>Text</h2>
tapasa vidyaya yukto
yogena susamadhina
rsin rsir hrsikesah
sasarjabhimatah prajah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tapasa--by penance; vidyaya--by worship; yuktah--being engaged; yogena--by concentration of the mind
in devotion; su-samadhina--by nice meditation; rsin--the sages; rsih--the first seer (Brahma); hrsikesah--
the controller of his senses; sasarja--created; abhimatah--beloved; prajah--sons.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having equipped himself with austere penance, adoration, mental concentration and absorption in
devotion, accompanied by dispassion, and having controlled his senses, Brahma, the self-born living
creature, evolved great sages as his beloved sons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The ritualistic performances of sacrifice are meant for material economic development; in other words,
they are meant to keep the body in good condition for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. But for actual
attainment of spiritual knowledge, other qualifications are needed. What is essential is vidya, or worship
of the Supreme Lord. Sometimes the word yoga is used to refer to the gymnastic performances of different
bodily postures which help mental concentration. Generally, the different bodily postures in the yoga
system are accepted by less intelligent men to be the end of yoga, but actually they are meant to
concentrate the mind upon the Supersoul. After creating persons for economic development, Brahma
created sages who would set the example for spiritual realization.
