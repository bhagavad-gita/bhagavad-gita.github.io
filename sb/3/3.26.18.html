antah purusa-rupena
kala-rupena yo bahih
samanvety esa sattvanam

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
antah--within; purusa-rupena--in the form of Supersoul; kala-rupena--in the form of time; yah--He who;
bahih--without; samanveti--exists; esah--He; sattvanam--of all living entities; bhagavan--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; atma-mayaya--by His potencies.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By exhibiting His potencies, the Supreme Personality of Godhead adjusts all these different elements,
keeping Himself within as the Supersoul and without as time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here it is stated that within the heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead resides as the Supersoul. This
situation is also explained in Bhagavad-gita: the Supersoul rests beside the individual soul and acts as a
witness. This is also confirmed elsewhere in the Vedic literature: two birds are sitting on the same tree of
the body; one is witnessing, and the other is eating the fruits of the tree. This purusa, or Paramatma, who
resides within the body of the individual soul, is described in Bhagavad-gita (13.23) as the upadrasta,
witness, and the anumanta, sanctioning authority. The conditioned soul engages in the happiness and
distress of the particular body given him by the arrangement of the external energy of the Supreme Lord.
But the supreme living being, or the Paramatma, is different from the conditioned soul. He is described in
Bhagavad-gita as mahesvara, or the Supreme Lord. He is Paramatma, not jivatma. Paramatma means the
Supersoul, who is sitting by the side of the conditioned soul just to sanction his activities. The
conditioned soul comes to this material world in order to lord it over material nature. Since one cannot do
anything without the sanction of the Supreme Lord, He lives with the jiva soul as witness and sanctiongiver.
He is also bhokta; He gives maintenance and sustenance to the conditioned soul.
Since the living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the Supreme personality of Godhead, the
Lord is very affectionate to the living entities. Unfortunately, when the living entity is bewildered or
illusioned by the external energy, he becomes forgetful of his eternal relationship with the Lord, but as
soon as he becomes aware of his constitutional position, he is liberated. The minute independence of the
conditioned soul is exhibited by his marginal position. If he likes, he can forget the Supreme Personality
of Godhead and come into the material existence with a false ego to lord it over material nature, but if he
likes he can turn his face to the service of the Lord. The individual living entity is given that
independence. His conditional life is ended and his life becomes successful as soon as he turns his face to
the Lord, but by misusing his independence he enters into material existence. Yet the Lord is so kind that,
as Supersoul, He always remains with the conditioned soul. The concern of the Lord is neither to enjoy
nor to suffer from the material body. He remains with the jiva simply as sanction-giver and witness so that
the living entity can receive the results of his activities, good or bad.
Outside the body of the conditioned soul, the Supreme personality of Godhead remains as the time
factor. According to the Sankhya system of philosophy, there are twenty-five elements. The twenty-four
elements already described plus the time factor make twenty-five. According to some learned
philosophers, the Supersoul is included to make a total of twenty-six elements.
