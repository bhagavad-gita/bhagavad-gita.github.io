<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
svaccha-sphatika-kudyesu
maha-marakatesu ca
ratna-pradipa abhanti
lalana ratna-samyutah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
svaccha--pure; sphatika--marble; kudyesu--on the walls; maha-marakatesu--decorated with valuable
emeralds; ca--and; ratna-pradipah--jewel lamps; abhanti--shine; lalanah--women; ratna--with jewelry;
samyutah--decorated.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The walls of the house were made of first-class marble, decorated with valuable jewels. There was no
need of light, for the household was illuminated by the rays of these jewels. The female members of the
household were all amply decorated with jewelry.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood from this statement that the opulences of household life were exhibited in valuable
jewels, ivory, first-class marble, and furniture made of gold and jewels. The clothes are also mentioned as
being decorated with golden filigree. Everything actually had some value. It was not like the furniture of
the present day, which is cast in valueless plastic or base metal. The way of Vedic civilization is that
whatever was used in household affairs had to be valuable. In case of need, such items of value could be
exchanged immediately. Thus one's broken and unwanted furniture and paraphernalia would never be
without value. This system is still followed by Indians in household affairs. They keep metal utensils and
golden ornaments or silver plates and valuable silk garments with gold embroidery, and in case of need,
they can have some money in exchange immediately. There are exchanges for the moneylenders and the
householders.
