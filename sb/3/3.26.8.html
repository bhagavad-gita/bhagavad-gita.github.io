<h2>Text</h2>

bhoktrtve sukha-duhkhanam

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
karya--the body; karana--the senses; kartrtve--regarding the demigods; karanam--the cause; prakrtim--
material nature; viduh--the learned understand; bhoktrtve--regarding the perception; sukha--of happiness;
duhkhanam--and of distress; purusam--the spirit soul; prakrteh--to material nature; param--
transcendental.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The cause of the conditioned soul's material body and senses, and the senses' presiding deities, the
demigods, is the material nature. This is understood by learned men. The feelings of happiness and
distress of the soul, who is transcendental by nature, are caused by the spirit soul himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that when the Lord descends to this material world, He comes as a person by
His own energy, atma-maya. He is not forced by any superior energy. He comes by His own will, and this
can be called His pastime, or lila. But here it is clearly stated that the conditioned soul is forced to take a
certain type of body and senses under the three modes of material nature. That body is not received
according to his own choice. In other words, a conditioned soul has no free choice; he has to accept a
certain type of body according to his karma. But when there are bodily reactions as felt in happiness and
distress, it is to be understood that the cause is the spirit soul himself. If he so desires, the spirit soul can
change this conditional life of dualities by choosing to serve Krsna. The living entity is the cause of his
own suffering, but he can also be the cause of his eternal happiness. When he wants to engage in Krsna
consciousness, a suitable body is offered to him by the internal potency, the spiritual energy of the Lord,
and when he wants to satisfy his senses, a material body is offered. Thus it is his free choice to accept a
spiritual body or a material body, but once the body is accepted he has to enjoy or suffer the
consequences. The Mayavadi philosopher's presentation is that the living entity enjoys his pastimes by
accepting the body of a hog. This theory is not acceptable, however, because the word "pastime" implies
voluntary acceptance for enjoyment. Therefore this interpretation is most misleading. When there is
enforced acceptance for suffering, it is not a pastime. The Lord's pastimes and the conditioned living
entity's acceptance of karmic reaction are not on the same level.
