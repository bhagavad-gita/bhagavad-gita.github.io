<h2>Text</h2>
tam nihsarantam salilad anudruto
hiranya-keso dviradam yatha jhasah

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--Him; nihsarantam--coming out; salilat--from the water; anudrutah--chased; hiranya-kesah--having
golden hair; dviradam--an elephant; yatha--as; jhasah--a crocodile; karala-damstrah--having fearful teeth;
asani-nisvanah--roaring like thunder; abravit--he said; gata-hriyam--for those who are shameless; kim--
what; tu--indeed; asatam--for the wretches; vigarhitam--reproachable.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demon, who had golden hair on his head and fearful tusks, gave chase to the Lord while He was
rising from the water, even as an alligator would chase an elephant. Roaring like thunder, he said: Are You
not ashamed of running away before a challenging adversary? There is nothing reproachable for
shameless creatures!
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord was coming out of the water, taking the earth in His arms to deliver it, the demon
derided Him with insulting words, but the Lord did not care because He was very conscious of His duty.
For a dutiful man there is nothing to fear. Similarly, those who are powerful have no fear of derision or
unkind words from an enemy. The Lord had nothing to fear from anyone, yet He was merciful to His
enemy by neglecting him. Although apparently He fled from the challenge, it was just to protect the earth
from calamity that He tolerated Hiranyaksa's deriding words.
