<h2>Text</h2>
atraiva narakah svarga
iti matah pracaksate
ya yatana vai narakyas
ta ihapy upalaksitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atra--in this world; eva--even; narakah--hell; svargah--heaven; iti--thus; matah--O mother; pracaksate--
they say; yah--which; yatanah--punishments; vai--certainly; narakyah--hellish; tah--they; iha--here; api--
also; upalaksitah--visible.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Kapila continued: My dear mother, it is sometimes said that we experience hell or heaven on this
planet, for hellish punishments are sometimes visible on this planet also.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes unbelievers do not accept these statements of scripture regarding hell. They disregard such
authorized descriptions. Lord Kapila therefore confirms them by saying that these hellish conditions are
also visible on this planet. It is not that they are only on the planet where Yamaraja lives. On the planet of
Yamaraja, the sinful man is given the chance to practice living in the hellish conditions which he will have
to endure in the next life, and then he is given a chance to take birth on another planet to continue his
hellish life. For example, if a man is to be punished to remain in hell and eat stool and urine, then first of
all he practices such habits on the planet of Yamaraja, and then he is given a particular type of body, that
of a hog, so that he can eat stool and think that he is enjoying life. It is stated previously that in any
hellish condition, the conditioned soul thinks he is happy. Otherwise, it would not be possible for him to
suffer hellish life.
