<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhuta--the material elements; suksma--the objects of enjoyment; indriya--the material senses; manah--
mind; buddhi--intelligence; adisu--and so on; iha--here; nidraya--by sleep; linesu--merged; asati--in the
unmanifest; yah--who; tatra--there; vinidrah--awake; nirahankriyah--freed from false ego.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Although a devotee appears to be merged in the five material elements, the objects of material
enjoyment, the material senses and material mind and intelligence, he is understood to be awake and to
be freed from the false ego.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The explanation by Rupa Gosvami in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of how a person can be liberated even
in this body is more elaborately explained in this verse. The living entity who has become satya-drk, who
realizes his position in relationship with the Supreme personality of Godhead, may remain apparently
merged in the five elements of matter, the five material sense objects, the ten senses and the mind and
intelligence, but still he is considered to be awake and to be freed from the reaction of false ego. Here the
word lina is very significant. The Mayavadi philosophers recommend merging in the impersonal
effulgence of Brahman; that is their ultimate goal, or destination. That merging is also mentioned here.
But in spite of merging, one can keep his individuality. The example given by Jiva Gosvami is that a green
bird that enters a green tree appears to merge in the color of greenness, but actually the bird does not lose
its individuality. Similarly, a living entity merged either in the material nature or in the spiritual nature
does not give up his individuality. Real individuality is to understand oneself to be the eternal servitor of
the Supreme Lord. This information is received from the mouth of Lord Caitanya. He said clearly, upon
the inquiry of Sanatana Gosvami, that a living entity is the servitor of Krsna eternally. Krsna also confirms
in Bhagavad-gita that the living entity is eternally His part and parcel. The part and parcel is meant to
serve the whole. This is individuality. It is so even in this material existence, when the living entity
apparently merges in matter. His gross body is made up of five elements, his subtle body is made of mind,
intelligence, false ego and contaminated consciousness, and he has five active senses and five knowledgeacquiring
senses. In this way he merges in matter. But even while merged in the twenty-four elements of
matter, he can keep his individuality as the eternal servitor of the Lord. Either in the spiritual nature or in
the material nature, such a servitor is to be considered a liberated soul. That is the explanation of the
authorities, and it is confirmed in this verse.
