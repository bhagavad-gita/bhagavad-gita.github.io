<h2>Text</h2>
vacam duhitaram tanvim
svayambhur haratim manah
akamam cakame ksattah
sa-kama iti nah srutam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vacam--Vak; duhitaram--unto the daughter; tanvim--born of his body; svayambhuh--Brahma; haratim--
attracting; manah--his mind; akamam--without being sexually inclined; cakame--desired; ksattah--O
Vidura; sa-kamah--being sexually inclined; iti--thus; nah--we; srutam--have heard.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Vidura, we have heard that Brahma had a daughter named Vak who was born from his body and who
attracted his mind toward sex, although she was not sexually inclined towards him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Balavan indriya-gramo vidvamsam api karsati (Bhag. 9.19.17). It is said that the senses are so mad and
strong that they can bewilder even the most sensible and learned man. Therefore it is advised that one
should not indulge in living alone even with one's mother, sister or daughter. Vidvamsam api karsati
means that even the most learned also become victims of the sensuous urge. Maitreya hesitated to state
this anomaly on the part of Brahma, who was sexually inclined to his own daughter, but still he
mentioned it because sometimes it so happens, and the living example is Brahma himself, although he is
the primeval living being and the most learned within the whole universe. If Brahma could be a victim of
the sexual urge, then what of others, who are prone to so many mundane frailties? This extraordinary
immortality on the part of Brahma was heard to have occurred in some particular kalpa, but it could not
have happened in the kalpa in which Brahma heard directly from the Lord the four essential verses of
Srimad-Bhagavatam because the Lord blessed Brahma, after giving him lessons on the Bhagavatam, that he
would never be bewildered in any kalpa whatsoever. This indicates that before the hearing of Srimad-
Bhagavatam he might have fallen a victim to such sensuality, but after hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam
directly from the Lord, there was no possibility of such failures.
One should, however, take serious note of this incident. The human being is a social animal, and his
unrestricted mixing with the fair sex leads to downfall. Such social freedom of man and woman, especially
among the younger section, is certainly a great stumbling block on the path of spiritual progress. Material
bondage is due only to sexual bondage, and therefore unrestricted association of man and woman is
surely a great impediment. Maitreya cited this example on the part of Brahma just to bring to our notice
this great danger.
