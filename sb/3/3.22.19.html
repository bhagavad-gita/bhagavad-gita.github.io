<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni expressed his desire for a very beautiful wife to Emperor Svayambhuva and accepted the
Emperor's daughter for marriage. Kardama Muni was in the hermitage practicing complete celibacy as a
brahmacari, and although he had the desire to marry, he did not want to be a householder for the whole
span of his life because he was conversant with the Vedic principles of human life. According to Vedic
principles, the first part of life should be utilized in brahmacarya for the development of character and
spiritual qualities. In the next part of life, one may accept a wife and beget children, but one should not
beget children like cats and dogs.
Kardama Muni desired to beget a child who would be a ray of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
should beget a child who can perform the duties of Visnu, otherwise there is no need to produce children.
There are two kinds of children born of good fathers: one is educated in Krsna consciousness so that he
can be delivered from the clutches of maya in that very life, and the other is a ray of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and teaches the world the ultimate goal of life. As will be described in later
chapters, Kardama Muni begot such a child--Kapila, the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead who
enunciated the philosophy of Sankhya. Great householders pray to God to send His representative so that
there may be an auspicious movement in human society. This is one reason to beget a child. Another
reason is that a highly enlightened parent can train a child in Krsna consciousness so that the child will
not have to come back again to this miserable world. Parents should see to it that the child born of them
does not enter the womb of a mother again. Unless one can train a child for liberation in that life, there is
no need to marry or produce children. If human society produces children like cats and dogs for the
disturbance of social order, then the world becomes hellish, as it has in this age of Kali. In this age,
neither parents nor their children are trained; both are animalistic and simply eat, sleep, mate, defend,
and gratify their senses. This disorder in social life cannot bring peace to human society. Kardama Muni
explains beforehand that he would not associate with the girl Devahuti for the whole duration of his life.
He would simply associate with her until she had a child. In other words, sex life should be utilized only
to produce a nice child, not for any other purpose. Human life is especially meant for complete devotion
to the service of the Lord. That is the philosophy of Lord Caitanya.
After fulfilling his responsibility to produce a nice child, one should take sannyasa and engage in the
perfectional paramahamsa stage. paramahamsa refers to the most highly elevated perfectional stage of life.
There are four stages within sannyasa life, and paramahamsa is the highest order. The Srimad-Bhagavatam
is called the paramahamsa-samhita, the treatise for the highest class of human beings. The paramahamsa
is free from envy. In other stages, even in the householder stage of life, there is competition and envy, but
since the activities of the human being in the paramahamsa stage are completely engaged in Krsna
consciousness, or devotional service, there is no scope for envy. In the same order as Kardama Muni,
about one hundred years ago, Thakura Bhaktivinoda also wanted to beget a child who could preach the
philosophy and teachings of Lord Caitanya to the fullest extent. By his prayers to the Lord he had as his
child Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, who at the present moment is preaching the
philosophy of Lord Caitanya throughout the entire world through his bona fide disciples.
