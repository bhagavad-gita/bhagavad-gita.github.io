<h2>Text</h2>
esa te 'ham vidhasyami
priyam bhiru yad icchasi
tasyah kamam na kah kuryat
siddhis traivargiki yatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
esah--this; te--your request; aham--I; vidhasyami--shall execute; priyam--very dear; bhiru--O afflicted
one; yat--what; icchasi--you are desiring; tasyah--her; kamam--desires; na--not; kah--who; kuryat--would
perform; siddhih--perfection of liberation; traivargiki--three; yatah--from whom.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O afflicted one, I shall forthwith gratify whatever desire is dear to you, for who else but you is the
source of the three perfections of liberation?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The three perfections of liberation are religiosity, economic development and sense gratification: For a
conditioned soul, the wife is considered to be the source of liberation because she offers her service to the
husband for his ultimate liberation. Conditional material existence is based on sense gratification, and if
someone has the good fortune to get a good wife, he is helped by the wife in all respects. If one is
disturbed in his conditional life, he becomes more and more entangled in material contamination. A
faithful wife is supposed to cooperate with her husband in fulfilling all material desires so that he can then
become comfortable and execute spiritual activities for the perfection of life. If, however, the husband is
progressive in spiritual advancement, the wife undoubtedly shares in his activities, and thus both the wife
and the husband profit in spiritual perfection. It is essential, therefore, that girls as well as boys be trained
to discharge spiritual duties so that at the time of cooperation both will be benefited. The training of the
boy is brahmacarya, and the training of the girl is chastity. A faithful wife and spiritually trained
brahmacari are a good combination for advancement of the human mission.
