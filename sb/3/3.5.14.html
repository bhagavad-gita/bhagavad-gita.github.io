<h2>Translation</h2>
O sage, persons who because of their sinful activities are averse to the topics of Transcendence and thus
ignorant of the purpose of the Mahabharata [Bhagavad-gita] are pitied by the pitiable. I also pity them
because I see how their duration of life is spoiled by eternal time while they involve themselves in
presentations of philosophical speculation, theoretical ultimate goals of life, and different modes of ritual.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the modes of material nature, there are three kinds of relationships between human beings
and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of ignorance and passion are averse
to the existence of God, or else they formally accept the existence of God in the capacity of an order
supplier. Above them are those who are in the mode of goodness. This second class of men believe the
Supreme Brahman to be impersonal. They accept the cult of bhakti, in which hearing of krsna-katha is the
first item, as a means and not the end. Above them are those who are pure devotees. They are situated in
the transcendental stage above the mode of material goodness. Such persons are decidedly convinced that
the name, form, fame, qualities, etc., of the Personality of Godhead are nondifferent from one another on
the absolute plane. For them, hearing of the topics of Krsna is equal to meeting with Him face to face.
According to this class of men, who are situated in pure devotional service to the Lord, the highest goal of
human life is purusartha, devotional service to the Lord, the real mission of life. The impersonalists,
because they engage in mental speculation and have no faith in the Personality of Godhead, have no
business hearing the topics of Krsna. Such persons are pitiable for the first-class pure devotees of the
Lord. The pitiable impersonalists pity those who are influenced by the modes of ignorance and passion,
but the pure devotees of the Lord take pity on them both because both waste their most valuable time in
the human form of life in false pursuits, sense enjoyment and mental speculative presentations of different
theories and goals of life.
