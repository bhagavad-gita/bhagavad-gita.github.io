<h2>Text</h2>
nabho dadati svasatam
padam yan-niyamad adah
lokam sva-deham tanute
mahan saptabhir avrtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nabhah--the sky; dadati--gives; svasatam--to the living entities; padam--abode; yat--of whom (the
Supreme Personality of Godhead); niyamat--under the control; adah--that; lokam--the universe; svadeham--
own body; tanute--expands; mahan--the mahat-tattva; saptabhih--with the seven (layers);
avrtam--covered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Subject to the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sky allows outer space to
accommodate all the various planets, which hold innumerable living entities. The total universal body
expands with its seven coverings under His supreme control.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood from this verse that all the planets in outer space are floating, and they all hold living
entities. The word svasatam means "those who breathe," or the living entities. In order to accommodate
them, there are innumerable planets. Every planet is a residence for innumerable living entities, and the
necessary space is provided in the sky by the supreme order of the Lord. It is also stated here that the total
universal body is increasing. It is covered by seven layers, and as there are five elements within the
universe, so the total elements, in layers, cover the outside of the universal body. The first layer is of
earth, and it is ten times greater in size than the space within the universe; the second layer is water, and
that is ten times greater than the earthly layer; the third covering is fire, which is ten times greater than
the water covering. In this way each layer is ten times greater than the previous one.
