<h2>Text</h2>
grhesu kuta-dharmesu
duhkha-tantresv atandritah
kurvan duhkha-pratikaram
sukhavan manyate grhi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
grhesu--in family life; kuta-dharmesu--involving the practice of falsehood; duhkha-tantresu--spreading
miseries; atandritah--attentive; kurvan--doing; duhkha-pratikaram--counteraction of miseries; sukha-vat--
as happiness; manyate--thinks; grhi--the householder.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The attached householder remains in his family life, which is full of diplomacy and politics. Always
spreading miseries and controlled by acts of sense gratification, he acts just to counteract the reactions of
all his miseries, and if he can successfully counteract such miseries, he thinks that he is happy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead Himself certifies the material world as an impermanent
place that is full of miseries. There is no question of happiness in this material world, either individually
or in terms of family, society or country. If something is going on in the name of happiness, that is also
illusion. Here in this material world, happiness means successful counteraction to the effects of distress.
The material world is so made that unless one becomes a clever diplomat, his life will be a failure. Not to
speak of human society, even the society of lower animals, the birds and bees, cleverly manages its bodily
demands of eating, sleeping and mating. Human society competes nationally or individually, and in the
attempt to be successful the entire human society becomes full of diplomacy. We should always remember
that in spite of all diplomacy and all intelligence in the struggle for our existence, everything will end in a
second by the supreme will. Therefore, all our attempts to become happy in this material world are simply
a delusion offered by maya.
