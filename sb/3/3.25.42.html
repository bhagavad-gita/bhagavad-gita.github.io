<h2>Translation</h2>
It is because of My supremacy that the wind blows, out of fear of Me; the sun shines out of fear of Me,
and the lord of the clouds, Indra, sends forth showers out of fear of Me. Fire burns out of fear of Me, and
death goes about taking its toll out of fear of Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, says in Bhagavad-gita that the natural laws being enacted
are correct in all activities because of His superintendence. No one should think that nature is working
automatically, without superintendence. The Vedic literature says that the clouds are controlled by the
demigod Indra, heat is distributed by the sun-god, the soothing moonlight is distributed by Candra, and
the air is blowing under the arrangement of the demigod Vayu. But above all these demigods, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the chief living entity. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. The demigods are
also ordinary living entities, but due to their faithfulness--their devotional service attitude--they have been
promoted to such posts. These different demigods, or directors, such as Candra, Varuna and Vayu, are
called adhikari-devata. The demigods are departmental heads. The government of the Supreme Lord
consists not only of one planet or two or three; there are millions of planets and millions of universes. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead has a huge government, and He requires assistants. The demigods are
considered His bodily limbs. These are the descriptions of Vedic literature. Under these circumstances,
the sun-god, the moon-god, the fire-god and the air-god are working under the direction of the Supreme
Lord. It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram. The natural laws
are being conducted under His superintendence. Because He is in the background, everything is being
performed punctually and regularly.
One who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely protected from all
other influences. He no longer serves or is obliged to anyone else. Of course he is not disobedient to
anyone, but his full power of thought is absorbed in the service of the Lord. The statements by the
Supreme personality of Godhead Kapila that under His direction the air is blowing, the fire is burning and
the sun is giving heat are not sentimental. The impersonalist may say that the Bhagavatam devotees create
and imagine someone as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and assign qualifications to Him; but
actually it is neither imagination nor an imposition of artificial power in the name of Godhead. In the
Vedas it is said, bhisasmad vatah pavate. bhisodeti suryah: "By fear of the Supreme Lord the wind-god and
the sun-god are acting." Bhisasmad agnis candras ca. mrtyur dhavati pancamah: "Agni, Indra and Mrtyu
are also acting under His direction." These are the statements of the Vedas.
