<h2>Text</h2>

arjavenarya-sangena

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
adhyatmika--spiritual matters; anusravanat--from hearing; nama-sankirtanat--from chanting the holy
name; ca--and; me--My; arjavena--with straightforward behavior; arya-sangena--with association of saintly

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A devotee should always try to hear about spiritual matters and should always utilize his time in
chanting the holy name of the Lord. His behavior should always be straightforward and simple, and
although he is not envious but friendly to everyone, he should avoid the company of persons who are not
spiritually advanced.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In order to advance in spiritual understanding, one has to hear from authentic sources about spiritual
knowledge. One can understand the reality of spiritual life by following strict regulative principles and by
controlling the senses. To have control it is necessary that one be nonviolent and truthful, refrain from
stealing, abstain from sex life and possess only that which is absolutely necessary for keeping the body
and soul together. One should not eat more than necessary, he should not collect more paraphernalia
than necessary, he should not talk unnecessarily with common men, and he should not follow the rules
and regulations without purpose. He should follow the rules and regulations so that he may actually make
advancement.
There are eighteen qualifications mentioned in Bhagavad-gita, among which is simplicity. One should
be without pride; one should not demand unnecessary respect from others, and one should be nonviolent.
Amanitvam adambhitvam ahimsa. One should be very tolerant and simple, one should accept the spiritual
master, and one should control the senses. These are mentioned here and in Bhagavad-gita as well. One
should hear from authentic sources how to advance in spiritual life; such instructions should be taken
from the acarya and should be assimilated.
It is especially mentioned here, nama-sankirtanac ca: one should chant the holy names of the Lord--
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare--either
individually or with others. Lord Caitanya has given special stress to chanting of these holy names of the
Lord as the basic principle of spiritual advancement. Another word used here is arjavena, meaning
"without diplomacy." A devotee should not make plans out of self-interest. Of course, preachers
sometimes have to make some plan to execute the mission of the Lord under proper guidance, but
regarding personal self-interest, a devotee should always be without diplomacy, and he should avoid the
company of persons who are not advancing in spiritual life. Another word is arya. Aryans are persons who
are advancing in knowledge of Krsna consciousness as well as in material prosperity. The difference
between the Aryan and non-Aryan, the sura and asura, is in their standards of spiritual advancement.
Association with persons who are not spiritually advanced is forbidden. Lord Caitanya advised, asatsanga-
tyaga: one should avoid persons who are attached to the temporary. Asat is one who is too
materially attached, who is not a devotee of the Lord and who is too attached to women or enjoyable
material things. Such a person, according to Vaisnava philosophy, is a persona non grata.
A devotee should not be proud of his acquisitions. The symptoms of a devotee are meekness and
humility. Although spiritually very advanced, he will always remain meek and humble, as Kaviraja
Gosvami and all the other Vaisnavas have taught us by personal example. Caitanya Mahaprabhu taught
that one should be humbler than the grass on the street and more tolerant than the tree. One should not
be proud or falsely puffed up. In this way one will surely advance in spiritual life.
