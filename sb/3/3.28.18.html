<h2>Text</h2>
kirtanya-tirtha-yasasam
punya-sloka-yasaskaram
dhyayed devam samagrangam
yavan na cyavate manah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kirtanya--worth singing; tirtha-yasasam--the glories of the Lord; punya-sloka--of the devotees; yasahkaram--
enhancing the glory; dhyayet--one should meditate; devam--upon the Lord; samagra-angam--all
the limbs; yavat--as much as; na--not; cyavate--deviates; manah--the mind.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The glory of the Lord is always worth singing, for His glories enhance the glories of His devotees. One
should therefore meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead and upon His devotees. One should
meditate on the eternal form of the Lord until the mind becomes fixed.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One has to fix his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. When one is accustomed to
thinking of one of the innumerable forms of the Lord--Krsna, Visnu, Rama, Narayana, etc.--he has
reached the perfection of yoga. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita: a person who has developed
pure love for the Lord, and whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of transcendental loving exchange,
always sees within his heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees especially see the Lord in
the beautiful blackish form of Syamasundara. That is the perfection of yoga. This yoga system should be
continued until the mind does not vacillate for a moment. Om tad visnoh paramam padam sada pasyanti
surayah: the form of Visnu is the highest individuality and is always visible to sages and saintly persons.
The same purpose is served when a devotee worships the form of the Lord in the temple. There is no
difference between devotional service in the temple and meditation on the form of the Lord, since the
form of the Lord is the same whether He appears within the mind or in some concrete element. There are
eight kinds of forms recommended for the devotees to see. The forms may be made out of sand, clay,
wood or stone, they may be contemplated within the mind or made of jewels, metal or painted colors, but
all the forms are of the same value. It is not that one who meditates on the form within the mind sees
differently from one who worships the form in the temple. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
absolute, and there is therefore no difference between the two. The impersonalists, who desire to
disregard the eternal form of the Lord, imagine some round figure. They especially prefer the omkara,
which also has form. In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that omkara is the letter form of the Lord. Similarly,
there are statue forms and painting forms of the Lord.
Another significant word in this verse is punya-sloka-yasaskaram. The devotee is called punya-sloka. As
one becomes purified by chanting the holy name of the Lord, so one can become purified simply by
chanting the name of a holy devotee. The pure devotee of the Lord and the Lord Himself are nondifferent.
It is sometimes feasible to chant the name of a holy devotee. This is a very sanctified process. Lord
Caitanya was once chanting the holy names of the gopis when His students criticized Him: "Why are You
chanting the names of the gopis? Why not 'Krsna'?" Lord Caitanya was irritated by the criticism, and so
there was some misunderstanding between Him and His students. He wanted to chastise them for desiring
to instruct Him on the transcendental process of chanting.
The beauty of the Lord is that the devotees who are connected with His activities are also glorified.
Arjuna, Prahlada, Janaka Maharaja, Bali Maharaja and many other devotees were not even in the
renounced order of life, but were householders. Some of them, such as Prahlada Maharaja and Bali
Maharaja, were born of demoniac families. Prahlada Maharaja's father was a demon, and Bali Maharaja
was the grandson of Prahlada Maharaja, but still they have become famous because of their association
with the Lord. Anyone who is eternally associated with the Lord is glorified with the Lord. The
conclusion is that a perfect yogi should always be accustomed to seeing the form of the Lord, and unless
the mind is fixed in that way, he should continue practicing yoga.
