tato nanda-vrajam itah
pitra kamsad vibibhyata
ekadasa samas tatra
gudharcih sa-balo 'vasat
SYNONYMS
tatah--thereafter; nanda-vrajam--cow pastures of Nanda Maharaja; itah--being brought up; pitra--by His
father; kamsat--from Kamsa; vibibhyata--being afraid of; ekadasa--eleven; samah--years; tatra--therein;
gudha-arcih--covered fire; sa-balah--with Baladeva; avasat--resided.
TRANSLATION
Thereafter, His father, being afraid of Kamsa, brought Him to the cow pastures of Maharaja Nanda, and
there He lived for eleven years like a covered flame with His elder brother, Baladeva.
PURPORT
There was no necessity of the Lord's being dispatched to the house of Nanda Maharaja out of fear of
Kamsa's determination to kill Him as soon as He appeared. It is the business of the asuras to try to kill the
Supreme Personality of Godhead or to prove by all means that there is no God or that Krsna is an
ordinary human being and not God. Lord Krsna is not affected by such determination of men of Kamsa's
class, but in order to play the role of a child He agreed to be carried by His father to the cow pastures of
Nanda Maharaja because Vasudeva was afraid of Kamsa. Nanda Maharaja was due to receive Him as his
child, and Yasodamayi was also to enjoy the childhood pastimes of the Lord, and therefore to fulfill
everyone's desire, He was carried from Mathura to Vrndavana just after His appearance in the prison
house of Kamsa. He lived there for eleven years and completed all His fascinating pastimes of childhood,
boyhood and adolescence with His elder brother, Lord Baladeva, His first expansion. Vasudeva's thought
of protecting Krsna from the wrath of Kamsa is part of a transcendental relationship. The Lord enjoys
more when someone takes Him as his subordinate son who needs the protection of a father than He does
when someone accepts Him as the Supreme Lord. He is the father of everyone, and He protects everyone,
but when His devotee takes it for granted that the Lord is to be protected by the devotee's care, it is a
transcendental joy for the Lord. Thus when Vasudeva, out of fear of Kamsa, carried Him to Vrndavana,
the Lord enjoyed it; otherwise, He had no fear from Kamsa or anyone else.
