<h2>Text</h2>
etan me janma loke 'smin
mumuksunam durasayat
prasankhyanaya tattvanam
sammatayatma-darsane
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etat--this; me--My; janma--birth; loke--in the world; asmin--in this; mumuksunam--by those great sages
seeking liberation; durasayat--from unnecessary material desires; prasankhyanaya--for explaining;
tattvanam--of the truths; sammataya--which is highly esteemed; atma-darsane--in self-realization.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My appearance in this world is especially to explain the philosophy of Sankhya, which is highly
esteemed for self-realization by those desiring freedom from the entanglement of unnecessary material
desires.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the word durasayat is very significant. Dur refers to trouble or duhkha, miseries. Asayat means
"from the shelter." We conditioned souls have taken shelter of the material body, which is full of troubles
and miseries. Foolish people cannot understand the situation, and this is called ignorance, illusion, or the
spell of maya. Human society should very seriously understand that the body itself is the source of all
miserable life. Modern civilization is supposed to be making advancement in scientific knowledge, but
what is this scientific knowledge? It is based on bodily comforts only, without knowledge that however
comfortably one maintains his body, the body is destructible. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, antavanta ime
dehah: these bodies are destined to be destroyed. Nityasyoktah saririnah refers to the living soul, or the
living spark, within the body. That soul is eternal, but the body is not eternal. For our activity we must
have a body; without a body, without sense organs, there is no activity. But people are not inquiring
whether it is possible to have an eternal body. Actually they aspire for an eternal body because even
though they engage in sense enjoyment, that sense enjoyment is not eternal. They are therefore in want of
something which they can enjoy eternally, but they do not understand how to attain that perfection.
Sankhya philosophy, therefore, as stated herein by Kapiladeva, is tattvanam. The Sankhya philosophy
system is designed to afford understanding of the real truth. What is that real truth? The real truth is
knowledge of how to get out of the material body, which is the source of all trouble. Lord Kapila's
incarnation, or descent, is especially meant for this purpose. That is clearly stated here.
