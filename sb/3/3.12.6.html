<h2>Text</h2>
so 'vadhyatah sutair evam
pratyakhyatanusasanaih
krodham durvisaham jatam
niyantum upacakrame
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Brahma); avadhyatah--thus being disrespected; sutaih--by the sons; evam--thus; pratyakhyata--
refusing to obey; anusasanaih--the order of their father; krodham--anger; durvisaham--too much to be
tolerated; jatam--thus generated; niyantum--to control; upacakrame--tried his best.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
On the refusal of the sons to obey the order of their father, there was much anger generated in the mind
of Brahma, which he tried to control and not express.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma is the director in charge of the mode of passion of material nature. Therefore it was natural for
him to become angry on the refusal of his sons to obey his order. Although the Kumaras were right in
such acts of refusal, Brahma, being absorbed in the mode of passion, could not check his passionate anger.
He did not express it, however, because he knew that his sons were far enlightened in spiritual
advancement and thus he should not express his anger before them.
