<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the mind is thus completely freed from all material contamination and detached from material
objectives, it is just like the flame of a lamp. At that time the mind is actually dovetailed with that of the
Supreme Lord and is experienced as one with Him because it is freed from the interactive flow of the
material qualities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the material world the activities of the mind are acceptance and rejection. As long as the mind is in
material consciousness, it must be forcibly trained to accept meditation on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, but when one is actually elevated to loving the Supreme Lord, the mind is automatically
absorbed in thought of the Lord. In such a position a yogi has no other thought than to serve the Lord.
This dovetailing of the mind with the desires of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called nirvana, or
making the mind one with the Supreme Lord.
The best example of nirvana is cited in Bhagavad-gita. In the beginning the mind of Arjuna deviated
from Krsna's. Krsna wanted Arjuna to fight, but Arjuna did not want to, so there was disagreement. But
after hearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna dovetailed his mind with
Krsna's desire. This is called oneness. This oneness, however, did not cause Arjuna and Krsna to lose their
individualities. The Mayavadi philosophers cannot understand this. They think that oneness necessitates
loss of individuality. Actually, however, we find in Bhagavad-gita that individuality is not lost. When the
mind is completely purified in love of Godhead, the mind becomes the mind of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. The mind at that time does not act separately, nor does it act without inspiration to fulfill the
desire of the Lord. The individual liberated soul has no other activity. pratinivrtta-guna-pravahah. In the
conditioned state the mind is always engaged in activity impelled by the three modes of the material
world, but in the transcendental stage, the material modes cannot disturb the mind of the devotee. The
devotee has no other concern than to satisfy the desires of the Lord. That is the highest stage of
perfection, called nirvana or nirvana-mukti. At this stage the mind becomes completely free from material
desire.
Yatharcih. Arcih means "flame." When a lamp is broken or the oil is finished, we see that the flame of
the lamp goes out. But according to scientific understanding, the flame is not extinguished; it is
conserved. This is conservation of energy. Similarly, when the mind stops functioning on the material
platform, it is conserved in the activities of the Supreme Lord. The Mayavadi philosophers' conception of
cessation of the functions of the mind is explained here: cessation of the mental functions means cessation
of activities conducted under the influence of the three modes of material nature.
