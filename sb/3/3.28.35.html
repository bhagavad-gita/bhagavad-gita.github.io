<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear mother, O daughter of Manu, a devotee who applies the science of devotional service and
mystic yoga in this way can achieve the abode of the Supreme Person simply by that devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Herein the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapiladeva perfectly explains that the mystic yoga system,
consisting of eight different kinds of yoga activities, has to be performed with the aim of coming to the
perfectional stage of bhakti-yoga. It is not acceptable for one to be satisfied simply by practicing the sitting
postures and thinking himself complete. By meditation one must attain the stage of devotional service. As
previously described, a yogi is advised to meditate on the form of Lord Visnu from point to point, from
the ankles to the legs to the knees to the thighs to the chest to the neck, and in this way gradually up to
the face and then to the ornaments. There is no question of impersonal meditation.
When, by meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all detail, one comes to the point of
love of God, that is the point of bhakti-yoga, and at that point he must actually render service to the Lord
out of transcendental love. Anyone who practices yoga and comes to the point of devotional service can
attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental abode. Here it is clearly stated, purusah
purusam vrajet: the purusa, the living entity, goes to the Supreme Person. The Supreme Personality of
Godhead and the living entity are qualitatively one; both are defined as purusa. The quality of purusa
exists both in the Supreme Godhead and in the living entity. purusa means "enjoyer," and the spirit of
enjoyment is present both in the living entity and in the Supreme Lord. The difference is that the quantity
of enjoyment is not equal. The living entity cannot experience the same quantity of enjoyment as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. An analogy may be made with a rich man and a poor man: the
propensity for enjoyment is present in both, but the poor man cannot enjoy in the same quantity as the
rich man. When the poor man dovetails his desires with those of the rich man, however, and when there
is cooperation between the poor man and the rich man, or between the big and the small man, then the
enjoyment is shared equally. That is like bhakti-yoga. purusah purusam vrajet: when the living entity
enters into the kingdom of God and cooperates with the Supreme Lord by giving Him enjoyment, he
enjoys the same facility or the same amount of pleasure as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
On the other hand, when the living entity wants to enjoy by imitating the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, his desire is called maya, and it puts him in the material atmosphere. A living entity who wants
to enjoy on his personal account and not cooperate with the Supreme Lord is engaged in materialistic life.
As soon as he dovetails his enjoyment with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is engaged in
spiritual life. An example may be cited here: The different limbs of the body cannot enjoy life
independently; they must cooperate with the whole body and supply food to the stomach. In so doing, all
the different parts of the body enjoy equally in cooperation with the whole body. That is the philosophy
of acintya-bhedabheda, simultaneous oneness and difference. The living entity cannot enjoy life in
opposition to the Supreme Lord; he has to dovetail his activities with the Lord by practicing bhakti-yoga.
It is said herein that one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead by either the yoga process
or the bhakti-yoga process. This indicates that factually there is no difference between yoga and bhaktiyoga
because the target of both is Visnu. In the modern age, however, a yoga process has been
manufactured which aims at something void and impersonal. Actually, yoga means meditation on the
form of Lord Visnu. If the yoga practice is actually performed according to the standard direction, there is
no difference between yoga and bhakti-yoga.
