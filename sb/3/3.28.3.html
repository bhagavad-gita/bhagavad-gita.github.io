<h2>Synonyms</h2>

bhavet--may become; acaksva--please describe; jiva-lokasya--for the people in general; vividhah--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Devahuti continued: My dear Lord, please also describe in detail, both for me and for people in general,
the continual process of birth and death, for by hearing of such calamities we may become detached from
the activities of this material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word samsrtih is very important. Sreyah-srti means the prosperous path of
advancement towards the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and samsrti means the continued journey on
the path of birth and death towards the darkest region of material existence. People who have no
knowledge of this material world, God and their actual intimate relationship with Him are actually going
to the darkest region of material existence in the name of progress in the material advancement of
civilization. To enter the darkest region of material existence means to enter into a species of life other
than the human species. Ignorant men do not know that after this life they are completely under the grip
of material nature and will be offered a life which may not be very congenial. How a living entity gets
different kinds of bodies will be explained in the next chapter. This continual change of bodies in birth
and death is called samsara. Devahuti requests her glorious son, Kapila Muni, to explain about this
continued journey to impress upon the conditioned souls that they are undergoing a path of degradation
by not understanding the path of bhakti-yoga, devotional service.
