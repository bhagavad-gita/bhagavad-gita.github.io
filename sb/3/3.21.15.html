<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, desiring to marry a girl of like disposition who may prove to be a veritable cow of plenty in
my married life, to satisfy my lustful desire I too have sought the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the
source of everything, for You are like a desire tree.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In spite of his condemning persons who approach the Lord for material advantages, Kardama Muni
expressed his material inability and desire before the Lord by saying, "Although I know that nothing
material should be asked from You, I nevertheless desire to marry a girl of like disposition." The phrase
"like disposition" is very significant. Formerly, boys and girls of similar dispositions were married; the
similar natures of the boy and girl were united in order to make them happy. Not more than twenty-five
years ago, and perhaps it is still current, parents in India used to consult the horoscope of the boy and girl
to see whether there would be factual union in their psychological conditions. These considerations are
very important. Nowadays marriage takes place without such consultation, and therefore, soon after the
marriage, there is divorce and separation. Formerly husband and wife used to live together peacefully
throughout their whole lives, but nowadays it is a very difficult task.
Kardama Muni wanted to have a wife of like disposition because a wife is necessary to assist in spiritual
and material advancement. It is said that a wife yields the fulfillment of all desires in religion, economic
development and sense gratification. If one has a nice wife, he is to be considered a most fortunate man.
In astrology, a man is considered fortunate who has great wealth, very good sons or a very good wife. Of
these three, one who has a very good wife is considered the most fortunate. Before marrying, one should
select a wife of like disposition and not be enamored by so-called beauty or other attractive features for
sense gratification. In the Bhagavatam, Twelfth Canto, it is said that in the Kali-yuga marriage will be
based on the consideration of sex life; as soon as there is deficiency in sex life, the question of divorce will
arise.
Kardama Muni could have asked his benediction from Uma, for it is recommended in the scriptures that
if anyone wants a good wife, he should worship Uma. But he preferred to worship the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because it is recommended in the Bhagavatam that everyone, whether he is full of
desires, has no desire or desires liberation, should worship the Supreme Lord. Of these three classes of
men, one tries to be happy by fulfillment of material desires, another wants to be happy by becoming one
with the Supreme, and another, the perfect man, is a devotee. He does not want anything in return from
the personality of Godhead; he only wants to render transcendental loving service. In any case, everyone
should worship the Supreme personality of Godhead, for He will fulfill everyone's desire. The advantage
of worshiping the Supreme Person is that even if one has desires for material enjoyment, if he worships
Krsna he will gradually become a pure devotee and have no more material hankering.
