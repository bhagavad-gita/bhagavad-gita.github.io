<h2>Translation</h2>
Upon seeing the charming forms of the Lord, smiling and attractive, and hearing His very pleasing
words, the pure devotee almost loses all other consciousness. His senses are freed from all other
engagements, and he becomes absorbed in devotional service. Thus in spite of his unwillingness, he
attains liberation without separate endeavor.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are three divisions of devotees--first-class, second-class and third-class. Even the third-class
devotees are liberated souls. It is explained in this verse that although they do not have knowledge, simply
by seeing the beautiful decoration of the Deity in the temple, the devotee is absorbed in thought of Him
and loses all other consciousness. Simply by fixing oneself in Krsna consciousness, engaging the senses in
the service of the Lord, one is imperceptibly liberated. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Simply by
discharging uncontaminated devotional service as prescribed in the scriptures, one becomes equal to
Brahman. In Bhagavad-gita it is said, brahma-bhuyaya kalpate. This means that the living entity in his
original state is Brahman because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman. But simply because of his
forgetfulness of his real nature as an eternal servitor of the Lord, he is overwhelmed and captured by
maya. His forgetfulness of his real constitutional position is maya. Otherwise he is eternally Brahman.
When one is trained to become conscious of his position, he understands that he is the servitor of the
Lord. "Brahman" refers to a state of self-realization. Even the third-class devotee--who is not advanced in
knowledge of the Absolute Truth but simply offers obeisances with great devotion, thinks of the Lord,
sees the Lord in the temple and brings forth flowers and fruits to offer to the Deity--becomes
imperceptibly liberated. Sraddhayanvitah: with great devotion the devotees offer worshipful respects and
paraphernalia to the Deity. The Deities of Radha and Krsna, Laksmi and Narayana, and Rama and Sita are
very attractive to devotees, so much so that when they see the statue decorated in the temple of the Lord
they become fully absorbed in thought of the Lord. That is the state of liberation. In other words, it is
confirmed herewith that even a third-class devotee is in the transcendental position, above those who are
trying for liberation by speculation or by other methods. Even great impersonalists like Sukadeva
Gosvami and the four Kumaras were attracted by the beauty of the Deities in the temple, by the
decorations and by the aroma of tulasi offered to the Lord, and they became devotees. Even though they
were in the liberated state, instead of remaining impersonalists they were attracted by the beauty of the
Lord and became devotees.
Here the word vilasa is very important. Vilasa refers to the activities or pastimes of the Lord. It is a
prescribed duty in temple worship that not only should one visit the temple to see the Deity nicely
decorated, but at the same time he should hear the recitation of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita or
some similar literature, which is regularly recited in the temple. It is the system in Vrndavana that in
every temple there is recitation of the sastras. Even third-class devotees who have no literary knowledge
or no time to read Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita get the opportunity to hear about the pastimes of
the Lord. In this way their minds may remain always absorbed in the thought of the Lord--His form, His
activities and His transcendental nature. This state of Krsna consciousness is a liberated stage. Lord
Caitanya, therefore, recommended five important processes in the discharge of devotional service: (1) to
chant the holy names of the Lord, Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare
Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, (2) to associate with devotees and serve them as far as possible, (3) to hear
Srimad-Bhagavatam, (4) to see the decorated temple and the Deity and, if possible, (5) to live in a place
like Vrndavana or Mathura. These five items alone can help a devotee achieve the highest perfectional
stage. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita and here in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. That third-class devotees
can also imperceptibly achieve liberation is accepted in all Vedic literatures.
