<h2>Text</h2>
sayanah parisocadbhih
parivitah sva-bandhubhih
vacyamano 'pi na brute
kala-pasa-vasam gatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sayanah--lying down; parisocadbhih--lamenting; parivitah--surrounded; sva-bandhubhih--by his
relatives and friends; vacyamanah--being urged to speak; api--although; na--not; brute--he speaks; kala--of
time; pasa--the noose; vasam--under the control of; gatah--gone.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In this way he comes under the clutches of death and lies down, surrounded by lamenting friends and
relatives, and although he wants to speak with them, he no longer can because he is under the control of
time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
For formality's sake, when a man is lying on his deathbed, his relatives come to him, and sometimes
they cry very loudly, addressing the dying man: "Oh, my father!" "Oh, my friend!" or "Oh, my husband!"
In that pitiable condition the dying man wants to speak with them and instruct them of his desires, but
because he is fully under the control of the time factor, death, he cannot express himself, and that causes
him inconceivable pain. He is already in a painful condition because of disease, and his glands and throat
are choked up with mucus. He is already in a very difficult position, and when he is addressed by his
relatives in that way, his grief increases.
