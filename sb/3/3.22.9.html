<h2>Translation</h2>
My daughter is the sister of Priyavrata and Uttanapada. She is seeking a suitable husband in terms of
age, character and good qualities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The grown-up daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, Devahuti, had good character and was well qualified;
therefore she was searching for a suitable husband just befitting her age, qualities and character. The
purpose of Manu's introducing his daughter as the sister of Priyavrata and Uttanapada, two great kings,
was to convince the sage that the girl came from a great family. She was his daughter and at the same time
the sister of ksatriyas; she did not come from a lower-class family. Manu therefore offered her to Kardama
as just suitable for his purpose. It is clear that although the daughter was mature in age and qualities, she
did not go out and find her husband independently. She expressed her desire for a suitable husband
corresponding to her character, age and quality, and the father himself, out of affection for his daughter,
took charge of finding such a husband.
