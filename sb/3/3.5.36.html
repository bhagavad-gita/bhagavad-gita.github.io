<h2>Text</h2>
jyotisambho 'nusamsrstam
vikurvad brahma-viksitam
mahim gandha-gunam adhat
kala-mayamsa-yogatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jyotisa--electricity; ambhah--water; anusamsrstam--thus created; vikurvat--due to transformation;
brahma--the Supreme; viksitam--so glanced over; mahim--the earth; gandha--smell; gunam--qualification;
adhat--was created; kala--eternal time; maya--external energy; amsa--partially; yogatah--by intermixture.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter the water produced from electricity was glanced over by the Supreme Personality of Godhead
and mixed with eternal time and external energy. Thus it was transformed into the earth, which is
qualified primarily by smell.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From the descriptions of the physical elements in the above verses it is clear that in all stages the glance
of the Supreme is needed with the other additions and alterations. In every transformation, the last
finishing touch is the glance of the Lord, who acts as a painter does when he mixes different colors to
transform them into a particular color. When one element mixes with another, the number of its qualities
increases. For example, the sky is the cause of air. The sky has only one quality, namely sound, but by the
interaction of the sky with the glance of the Lord, mixed with eternal time and external nature, the air is
produced, which has two qualities--sound and touch. Similarly after the air is created, interaction of sky
and air, touched by time and the external energy of the Lord, produces electricity. And after the
interaction of electricity with air and sky, mixed with time, external energy and the Lord's glance over
them, the water is produced. In the final stage of sky there is one quality, namely sound; in the air two
qualities, sound and touch; in the electricity three qualities, namely sound, touch and form; in the water
four qualities, sound, touch, form and taste; and in the last stage of physical development the result is
earth, which has all five qualities--sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Although they are different
mixtures of different materials, such mixtures do not take place automatically, just as a mixture of colors
does not take place automatically without the touch of the living painter. The automatic system is
factually activated by the glancing touch of the Lord. Living consciousness is the final word in all physical
changes. This fact is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (9.10) as follows:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
The conclusion is that the physical elements may work very wonderfully to the laymen's eyes, but their
workings actually take place under the supervision of the Lord. Those who can mark only the changes of
the physical elements and cannot perceive the hidden hands of the Lord behind them are certainly less
intelligent persons, although they may be advertised as great material scientists.
