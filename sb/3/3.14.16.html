<h2>Text</h2>
iti tam vira maricah
krpanam bahu-bhasinim
pratyahanunayan vaca
pravrddhananga-kasmalam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
iti--thus; tam--unto her; vira--O hero; maricah--the son of Marici (Kasyapa); krpanam--unto the poor;
bahu-bhasinim--too talkative; pratyaha--replied; anunayan--pacifying; vaca--by words; pravrddha--highly
agitated; ananga--lust; kasmalam--contaminated.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O hero [Vidura], Diti, being thus afflicted by the contamination of lust, and therefore poor and
talkative, was pacified by the son of Marici in suitable words.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a man or woman is afflicted by the lust of sex desire, it is to be understood as sinful
contamination. Kasyapa was engaged in his spiritual activities, but he did not have sufficient strength to
refuse his wife, who was thus afflicted. He could have refused her with strong words expressing
impossibility, but he was not as spiritually strong as Vidura. Vidura is addressed here as a hero because no
one is stronger in self-control than a devotee of the Lord. It appears that Kasyapa was already inclined to
have sexual enjoyment with his wife, and because he was not a strong man he tried to dissuade her only
with pacifying words.
