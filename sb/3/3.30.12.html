<h2>Translation</h2>
The human soul says: I take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
appears in His various eternal forms and walks on the surface of the world. I take shelter of Him only,
because He can give me relief from all fear and from Him I have received this condition of life, which is
just befitting my impious activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word calac-caranaravindam refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who actually walks or
travels upon the surface of the world. For example, Lord Ramacandra actually walked on the surface of
the world, and Lord Krsna also walked just like an ordinary man. The prayer is therefore offered to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who descends to the surface of this earth, or any part of this universe,
for the protection of the pious and the destruction of the impious. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that
when there is an increase of irreligion and discrepancies arise in the real religious activities, the Supreme
Lord comes to protect the pious and kill the impious. This verse indicates Lord Krsna.
Another significant point in this verse is that the Lord comes, icchaya, by His own will. As Krsna
confirms in Bhagavad-gita, sambhavamy atma-mayaya: "I appear at My will, by My internal potential
power." He is not forced to come by the laws of material nature. It is stated here, icchaya: He does not
assume any form, as the impersonalists think, because He comes at His own will, and the form in which
He descends is His eternal form. As the Supreme Lord puts the living entity into the condition of horrible
existence, He can also deliver him, and therefore one should seek shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna. Krsna
demands, "Give up everything and surrender unto Me." And it is also said in Bhagavad-gita that anyone
who approaches Him does not come back again to accept a form in material existence, but goes back to
Godhead, back home, never to return.
