<h2>Text</h2>
tad-dehah paratah poso
'py akrsas cadhy-asambhavat
babhau malair avacchannah
sadhuma iva pavakah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat-dehah--her body; paratah--by others (the damsels created by Kardama); posah--maintained; api--
although; akrsah--not thin; ca--and; adhi--anxiety; asambhavat--from not occurring; babhau--shone;
malaih--by dust; avacchannah--covered; sa-dhumah--surrounded with smoke; iva--like; pavakah--a fire.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Her body was being taken care of by the spiritual damsels created by her husband, Kardama, and since
she had no mental anxiety at that time, her body did not become thin. She appeared just like a fire
surrounded by smoke.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because she was always in trance in transcendental bliss, the thought of the Personality of Godhead was
always carefully fixed in her mind. She did not become thin, for she was taken care of by the celestial
maidservants created by her husband. It is said, according to the Ayur-vedic medical science, that if one is
free from anxieties he generally becomes fat. Devahuti, being situated in Krsna consciousness, had no
mental anxieties, and therefore her body did not become thin. It is customary in the renounced order of
life that one should not take any service from a servant or maid, but Devahuti was being served by the
celestial maidservants. This may appear to be against the spiritual concept of life, but just as fire is still
beautiful even when surrounded by smoke, she looked completely pure although it seemed that she was
living in a luxurious way.
