<h2>Translation</h2>
The sages came from the highest planets down to the lower region through the water of the Ganges, and
therefore the hair on their heads was wet. They touched the lotus feet of the Lord, which are worshiped
with various paraphernalia by the daughters of the serpent-king when they desire good husbands.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Ganges water flows directly from the lotus feet of Visnu, and its course runs from the highest planet
of the universe down to the lowest. The sages came down from Satyaloka by taking advantage of the
flowing water, a process of transportation made possible by the power of mystic yoga. If a river flows
thousands and thousands of miles, a perfect yogi can at once transport himself from one place to another
simply by dipping in its water. The Ganges is the only celestial river which flows throughout the universe,
and great sages travel all over the universe via this sacred river. The statement that their hair was wet
indicates that it was directly moistened by the water originating from the lotus feet of Visnu (the Ganges).
Whoever touches the water of the Ganges to his head surely touches the lotus feet of the Lord directly and
can become free from all effects of sinful acts. If after taking a bath in the Ganges or being washed of all
sins, a man guards himself against committing further sinful acts, then certainly he is delivered. But if he
again takes up sinful activities, his bath in the Ganges is as good as that of the elephant, who nicely takes
his bath in a river but later spoils the whole thing by covering himself with dust on the land.
