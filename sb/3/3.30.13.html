<h2>Translation</h2>
I, the pure soul, appearing now bound by my activities, am lying in the womb of my mother by the
arrangement of maya. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Him who is also here with me but who is
unaffected and changeless. He is unlimited, but He is perceived in the repentant heart. To Him I offer my
respectful obeisances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in the previous verse, the jiva soul says, "I take shelter of the Supreme Lord." Therefore,
constitutionally, the jiva soul is the subordinate servitor of the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead.
Both the Supreme Soul and the jiva soul are sitting in the same body, as confirmed in the Upanisads. They
are sitting as friends, but one is suffering, and the other is aloof from suffering.
In this verse it is said, visuddham avikaram akhanda-bodham: the Supersoul is always sitting apart from
all contamination. The living entity is contaminated and suffering because he has a material body, but that
does not mean that because the Lord is also with him, He also has a I material body. He is avikaram,
changeless. He is always the same Supreme, but unfortunately the Mayavadi philosophers, because of
their impure hearts, cannot understand that the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, is different from the
individual soul. It is said here, atapyamana-hrdaye 'vasitam: He is in the heart of every living entity, but
He can be realized only by a soul who is repentant. The individual soul becomes repentant that he forgot
his constitutional position, wanted to become one with the Supreme Soul and tried his best to lord it over
material nature. He has been baffled, and therefore he is repentant. At that time, Supersoul, or the
relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul, is realized. As it is confirmed in Bhagavadgita,
after many, many births the knowledge comes to the conditioned soul that Vasudeva is great, He is
master, and He is Lord. The individual soul is the servant, and therefore he surrenders unto Him. At that
time he becomes a mahatma, a great soul. Therefore, a fortunate living being who comes to this
understanding, even within the womb of his mother, has his liberation assured.
