speaker; lingatvam--that which indicates the presence; eva--also; ca--and; tat-matratvam--the subtle
element; ca--and; nabhasah--of ether; laksanam--definition; kavayah--learned persons; viduh--know.
TRANSLATION
Persons who are learned and who have true knowledge define sound as that which conveys the idea of
an object, indicates the presence of a speaker screened from our view and constitutes the subtle form of
ether.
PURPORT
It is very clear herein that as soon as we speak of hearing, there must be a speaker; without a speaker
there is no question of hearing. Therefore the Vedic knowledge, which is known as sruti, or that which is
received by hearing, is also called apaurusa. Apaurusa means "not spoken by any person materially
created." It is stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, tene brahma hrda. The sound of Brahman, or
Veda, was first impregnated into the heart of Brahma, the original learned man (adi-kavaye). How did he
become learned? Whenever there is learning, there must be a speaker and the process of hearing. But
Brahma was the first created being. Who spoke to him? Since no one was there, who was the spiritual
master to give knowledge? He was the only living creature; therefore the Vedic knowledge was imparted
within his heart by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone as Paramatma.
Vedic knowledge is understood to be spoken by the Supreme Lord, and therefore it is free from the
defects of material understanding. Material understanding is defective. If we hear something from a
conditioned soul, it is full of defects. All material and mundane information is tainted by illusion, error,
cheating and imperfection of the senses. Because Vedic knowledge was imparted by the Supreme Lord,
who is transcendental to material creation, it is perfect. If we receive that Vedic knowledge from Brahma
in disciplic succession, then we receive perfect knowledge.
Every word we hear has a meaning behind it. As soon as we hear the word "water," there is a
substance--water--behind the word. Similarly, as soon as we hear the word "God," there is a meaning to it.
If we receive that meaning and explanation of "God" from God Himself, then it is perfect. But if we
speculate about the meaning of "God," it is imperfect. Bhagavad-gita, which is the science of God, is
spoken by the Personality of Godhead Himself. This is perfect knowledge. Mental speculators or so-called
philosophers who are researching what is actually God will never understand the nature of God. The
science of God has to be understood in disciplic succession from Brahma, who was first instructed about
knowledge of God by God Himself. We can understand the knowledge of God by hearing Bhagavad-gita
from a person authorized in the disciplic succession.
When we speak of seeing, there must be form. By our sense perception, the beginning experience is the
sky. Sky is the beginning of form. And from the sky, other forms emanate. The objects of knowledge and
sense perception begin, therefore, from the sky.
