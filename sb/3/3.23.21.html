yards; ajiraih--with outer yards; yatha-upajosam--according to comfort; racitaih--which were designed;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The castle had pleasure grounds, resting chambers, bedrooms and inner and outer yards designed with
an eye to comfort. All this caused astonishment to the sage himself.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni, being a saintly person, was living in a humble hermitage, but when he saw the palace
constructed by his yogic powers, which was full of resting rooms, rooms for sex enjoyment, and inner and
outer yards, he himself was astonished. That is the way of a God-gifted person. A devotee like Kardama
Muni exhibited such opulence by his yogic power at the request of his wife, but when the opulence was
produced, he himself could not understand how such manifestations could be possible. When a yogi's
power is exhibited, the yogi himself is sometimes astonished.
