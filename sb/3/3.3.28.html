<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter they offered the brahmanas highly delicious foodstuffs first offered to the Personality of
Godhead and offered their respectful obeisances by touching their heads to the ground. They lived
perfectly by protecting the cows and the brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The behavior exhibited by the descendants of Yadu in the pilgrimage site of Prabhasa was highly
cultured and exactly to the point of human perfection. The perfection of human life is attained by
following three principles of civilization: protecting the cows, maintaining the brahminical culture and,
above all, becoming a pure devotee of the Lord. Without becoming a devotee of the Lord, one cannot
perfect one's human life. The perfection of human life is to be elevated to the spiritual world, where there
is no birth, no death, no disease and no old age. That is the highest perfectional aim of human life.
Without this aim, any amount of material advancement in so-called comforts can only bring the defeat of
the human form of life.
Brahmanas and Vaisnavas do not accept any foodstuff which is not first offered to the Personality of
Godhead. Foodstuff offered to the Lord is accepted by the devotees as the mercy of the Lord. After all, the
Lord supplies all kinds of foodstuff, both to the human being and to other animals. A human being must
be conscious of the fact that all foodstuffs, namely grains, vegetables, milk, water, etc.--the prime
necessities of life--are supplied for mankind by the Lord, and such foodstuffs cannot be manufactured by
any scientist or materialist in a laboratory or factory established by human effort. The intelligent class of
men are called brahmanas, and those who have realized the Absolute Truth in His supreme personal
feature are called Vaisnavas. But both of them accept foodstuffs which are the remnants of sacrifice.
Sacrifice is ultimately meant to satisfy the yajna-purusa, Visnu. In Bhagavad-gita (3.13) it is said that one
who accepts foodstuffs as the remnants of sacrifice is freed from all sinful reactions, and one who cooks
foodstuffs for maintenance of his body takes in all kinds of sins, which lead only to suffering. The
foodstuffs prepared by the Yadus at the Prabhasa pilgrimage site to offer to the bona fide brahmanas there
were all offered to the Personality of Godhead, Visnu. The Yadus offered their sincere obeisances by
touching their heads to the ground. The Yadus or any enlightened family in Vedic culture are trained for
attainment of human perfection by total cooperation of service between the different divisions of social
orders.
The word uru-rasam is also significant here. Hundreds of delicacies can be prepared simply by the
combination of grains, vegetables and milk. All such preparations are in the mode of goodness and
therefore may be offered to the Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.26), the Lord
accepts only foodstuffs which are within the range of fruits, flowers, leaves and liquids, provided they are
offered in complete devotional service. Devotional service is the only criterion for a bona fide offering to
the Lord. The Lord assures that He positively eats such foodstuffs offered by the devotees. So, judging
from all sides, the Yadus were perfectly trained civilized persons, and their being cursed by the brahmana
sages was only by the desire of the Lord; the whole incident was a warning to all concerned that no one
should behave lightly with brahmanas and Vaisnavas.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Third Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "The Lord's pastimes Out of Vrndavana."
