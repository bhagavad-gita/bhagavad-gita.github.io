<h2>Text</h2>
tam sukharadhyam rjubhir
ananya-saranair nrbhih
krtajnah ko na seveta
duraradhyam asadhubhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--unto Him; sukha--easily; aradhyam--worshiped; rjubhih--by the unpretentious; ananya--no other;
saranaih--who take shelter; nrbhih--by men; krta-jnah--grateful soul; kah--what; na--not; seveta--would
render service; duraradhyam--impossible to be worshiped; asadhubhih--by the nondevotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What grateful soul is there who would not render his loving service to such a great master as the
Personality of Godhead? The Lord can be easily pleased by spotless devotees who resort exclusively to
Him for protection, though the unrighteous man finds it difficult to propitiate Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living entity, especially persons in the human race, must feel grateful for the benedictions offered
by the grace of the Supreme Lord. Anyone, therefore, with a simple heart of gratefulness must be Krsna
conscious and offer devotional service to the Lord. Those who are actually thieves and rogues do not
recognize or acknowledge the benedictions offered to them by the Supreme Lord, and they cannot render
Him devotional service. Ungrateful persons are those who do not understand how much benefit they are
deriving by the arrangement of the Lord. They enjoy the sunshine and moonshine, and they get water free
of charge, yet they do not feel grateful, but simply go on enjoying these gifts of the Lord. Therefore, they
must be called thieves and rogues.
