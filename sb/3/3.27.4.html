<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
arthe hy avidyamane 'pi
samsrtir na nivartate
dhyayato visayan asya
svapne 'narthagamo yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
arthe--real cause; hi--certainly; avidyamane--not existing; api--although; samsrtih--the material
existential condition; na--not; nivartate--does cease; dhyayatah--contemplating; visayan--objects of the
senses; asya--of the living entity; svapne--in a dream; anartha--of disadvantages; agamah--arrival; yatha--
like.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Actually a living entity is transcendental to material existence, but because of his mentality of lording it
over material nature, his material existential condition does not cease, and just as in a dream, he is
affected by all sorts of disadvantages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The example of a dream is very appropriate. Due to different mental conditions, in dreams we are put
into advantageous and disadvantageous positions. Similarly, the spirit soul has nothing to do with this
material nature, but because of his mentality of lording it over, he is put into the position of conditional
existence.
Conditional existence is described here as dhyayato visayan asya. Visaya means "an object of
enjoyment." As long as one continues to think that he can enjoy material advantages, he is in conditioned
life, but as soon as he comes to his senses, he develops the knowledge that he is not the enjoyer, for the
only enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), He is the
beneficiary for all the results of sacrifices and penances (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam), and He is the
proprietor of all the three worlds (sarva-loka-mahesvaram). He is the actual friend of all living entities.
But instead of leaving proprietorship, enjoyment and the actual position as the friend of all living entities
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we claim that we are the proprietors, the enjoyers and the friends.
We perform philanthropic work, thinking that we are the friends of human society. Someone may
proclaim himself to be a very good national worker, the best friend of the people and of the country, but
actually he cannot be the greatest friend of everyone. The only friend is Krsna. One should try to raise the
consciousness of the conditioned soul to the platform of understanding that Krsna is his actual friend. If
one makes friendship with Krsna, one will never be cheated, and he will get all help needed. Arousing this
consciousness of the conditioned soul is the greatest service, not posing oneself as a great friend of
another living entity. The power of friendship is limited. Although one claims to be a friend, he cannot be
a friend unlimitedly. There are an unlimited number of living entities, and our resources are limited;
therefore we cannot be of any real benefit to the people in general. The best service to the people in
general is to awaken them to Krsna consciousness so that they may know that the supreme enjoyer, the
supreme proprietor and the supreme friend is Krsna. Then this illusory dream of lording it over material
nature will vanish.
