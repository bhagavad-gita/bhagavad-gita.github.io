<h2>Text</h2>
sviyam vakyam rtam kartum
avatirno 'si me grhe
cikirsur bhagavan jnanam
bhaktanam mana-vardhanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sviyam--Your own; vakyam--words; rtam--true; kartum--to make; avatirnah--descended; asi--You are;
me grhe--in my house; cikirsuh--desirous of disseminating; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead;
jnanam--knowledge; bhaktanam--of the devotees; mana--the honor; vardhanah--who increases.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kardama Muni said: You, my dear Lord, who are always increasing the honor of Your devotees, have
descended in my home just to fulfill Your word and disseminate the process of real knowledge.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord appeared before Kardama Muni after his mature yoga practice, He promised that He
would become Kardama's son. He descended as the son of Kardama Muni in order to fulfill that promise.
Another purpose of His appearance is cikirsur bhagavan jnanam, to distribute knowledge. Therefore, He is
called bhaktanam mana-vardhanah, "He who increases the honor of His devotees." By distributing
Sankhya He would increase the honor of the devotees; therefore, Sankhya philosophy is not dry mental
speculation. Sankhya philosophy means devotional service. How could the honor of the devotees be
increased unless Sankhya were meant for devotional service? Devotees are not interested in speculative
knowledge; therefore, the Sankhya enunciated by Kapila Muni is meant to establish one firmly in
devotional service. Real knowledge and real liberation is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and engage in devotional service.
