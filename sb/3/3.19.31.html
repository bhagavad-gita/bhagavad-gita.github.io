<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya continued: After thus killing the most formidable demon Hiranyaksa, the Supreme Lord
Hari, the origin of the boar species, returned to His own abode, where there is always an uninterrupted
festival. The Lord was praised by all the demigods, headed by Brahma.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is spoken of herewith as the origin of the boar species. As stated in the Vedanta-sutra (1.1.2),
the Absolute Truth is the origin of everything. Therefore it is to be understood that all 8,400,000 species
of bodily forms originate from the Lord, who is always adi, or the beginning. In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna
addresses the Lord as adyam, or the original. Similarly, in the Brahma-samhita the Lord is addressed as
adi-purusam, the original person. Indeed, in Bhagavad-gita (10.8) the Lord Himself declares, mattah
sarvam pravartate: "From Me everything proceeds."
In this situation the Lord assumed the shape of a boar to kill the demon Hiranyaksa and pick up the
earth from the Garbha Ocean. Thus He became adi-sukara, the original boar. In the material world a boar
or pig is considered most abominable, but the adi-sukara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was not
treated as an ordinary boar. Even Lord Brahma and the other demigods praised the Lord's form as a boar.
This verse confirms the statement in Bhagavad-gita that the Lord appears as He is from His
transcendental abode for the sake of killing the miscreants and saving the devotees. By killing the demon
Hiranyaksa He fulfilled His promise to kill the demons and always protect the demigods headed by
Brahma. The statement that the Lord returned to His own abode indicates that He has His own particular
transcendental residence. Since He is full of all energies, He is all-pervasive in spite of His residing in
Goloka Vrndavana, just as the sun, although situated in a particular place within the universe, is present
by its sunshine throughout the universe.
Although the Lord has His particular abode in which to reside, He is all-pervasive. The impersonalists
accept one aspect of the Lord's features, the all-pervasive aspect, but they cannot understand His localized
situation in His transcendental abode, where He always engages in fully transcendental pastimes.
Especially mentioned in this verse is the word akhanditotsavam. Utsava means "pleasure." Whenever
some function takes place to express happiness, it is called utsava. Utsava, the expression of complete
happiness, is always present in the Vaikunthalokas, the abode of the Lord, who is worshipable even by
demigods like Brahma, to say nothing of other, less important entities such as human beings.
The Lord descends from His abode to this world, and therefore He is called avatara, which means "one
who descends." Sometimes avatara is understood to refer to an incarnation who assumes a material form
of flesh and bone, but actually avatara refers to one who descends from higher regions. The Lord's abode
is situated far above this material sky, and He descends from that higher position; thus He is called
avatara.
