TRANSLATION
Let me take shelter of the lotus feet of Him whose incarnations, qualities and activities are mysterious
imitations of worldly affairs. One who invokes His transcendental names, even unconsciously, at the time
he quits this life, is certainly washed immediately of the sins of many, many births and attains Him
without fail.
PURPORT
The activities of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are a kind of imitation of the
activities going on in the material world. He is just like an actor on a stage. An actor imitates the activities
of a king on stage, although actually he is not the king. Similarly, when the Lord incarnates, He imitates
parts with which He has nothing to do. In Bhagavad-gita (4.14), it is said that the Lord has nothing to do
with the activities in which He is supposedly engaged: na mam karmani limpanti na me karma-phale
sprha. The Lord is omnipotent; simply by His will He can perform anything and everything. When the
Lord appeared as Lord Krsna, He played the part of the son of Yasoda and Nanda, and He lifted the
Govardhana Hill, although lifting a hill is not His concern. He can lift millions of Govardhana Hills by His
simple desire; He does not need to lift it with His hand. But He imitates the ordinary living entity by this
lifting, and at the same time He exhibits His supernatural power. Thus His name is chanted as the lifter of
Govardhana Hill, or Sri Govardhana-dhari. Therefore, His acts in His incarnations and His partiality to the
devotees are all imitations only, just like the stage makeup of an expert dramatical player. His acts in that
capacity, however, are all omnipotent, and the remembrance of such activities of the incarnations of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is as powerful as the Lord Himself. Ajamila remembered the holy name
of the Lord, Narayana, by merely calling the name of his son Narayana, and that gave him a complete
opportunity to achieve the highest perfection of life.
