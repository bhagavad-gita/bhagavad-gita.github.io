<h2>Translation</h2>
A living entity who, as a result of attachment to a woman in his previous life, has been endowed with
the form of a woman, foolishly looks upon maya in the form of a man, her husband, as the bestower of
wealth, progeny, house and other material assets.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From this verse it appears that a woman is also supposed to have been a man in his (her) previous life,
and due to his attachment to his wife, he now has the body of a woman. Bhagavad-gita confirms this; a
man gets his next life's birth according to what he thinks of at the time of death. If someone is too
attached to his wife, naturally he thinks of his wife at the time of death, and in his next life he takes the
body of a woman. Similarly, if a woman thinks of her husband at the time of death, naturally she gets the
body of a man in the next life. In the Hindu scriptures, therefore, woman's chastity and devotion to man is
greatly emphasized. A woman's attachment to her husband may elevate her to the body of a man in her
next life, but a man's attachment to a woman will degrade him, and in his next life he will get the body of
a woman. We should always remember, as it is stated in Bhagavad-gita, that both the gross and subtle
material bodies are dresses; they are the shirt and coat of the living entity. To be either a woman or a man
only involves one's bodily dress. The soul in nature is actually the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord.
Every living entity, being classified as energy, is supposed to be originally a woman, or one who is
enjoyed. In the body of a man there is a greater opportunity to get out of the material clutches; there is
less opportunity in the body of a woman. In this verse it is indicated that the body of a man should not be
misused through forming an attachment to women and thus becoming too entangled in material
enjoyment, which will result in getting the body of a woman in the next life. A woman is generally fond of
household prosperity, ornaments, furniture and dresses. She is satisfied when the husband supplies all
these things sufficiently. The relationship between man and woman is very complicated, but the substance
is that one who aspires to ascend to the transcendental stage of spiritual realization should be very careful
in accepting the association of a woman. In the stage of Krsna consciousness, however, such restriction of
association may be slackened because if a man's and woman's attachment is not to each other but to
Krsna, then both of them are equally eligible to get out of the material entanglement and reach the abode
of Krsna. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, anyone who seriously takes to Krsna consciousness--
whether in the lowest species of life or a woman or of the less intelligent classes, such as the mercantile or
laborer class--will go back home, back to Godhead, and reach the abode of Krsna. A man should not be
attached to a woman, nor should a woman be attached to a man. Both man and woman should be
attached to the service of the Lord. Then there is the possibility of liberation from material entanglement
for both of them.
