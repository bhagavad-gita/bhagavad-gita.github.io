<h2>Text</h2>
tatrahrtas ta nara-deva-kanyah
kujena drstva harim arta-bandhum
utthaya sadyo jagrhuh praharsavridanuraga-
prahitavalokaih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatra--inside the house of Narakasura; ahrtah--kidnapped; tah--all those; nara-deva-kanyah--daughters
of many kings; kujena--by the demon; drstva--by seeing; harim--the Lord; arta-bandhum--the friend of the
distressed; utthaya--at once got up; sadyah--then and there; jagrhuh--accepted; praharsa--joyfully; vrida--
shyness; anuraga--attachment; prahita-avalokaih--by eager glances.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There in the house of the demon, all the princesses kidnapped by Narakasura at once became alert upon
seeing the Lord, the friend of the distressed. They looked upon Him with eagerness, joy and shyness and
offered to be His wives.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Narakasura kidnapped many daughters of great kings and kept them imprisoned in his palace. But when
he was killed by the Lord and the Lord entered the house of the demon, all the princesses were enlivened
with joy and offered to become His wives because the Lord is the only friend of the distressed. Unless the
Lord accepted them, there would be no chance of their being married because the demon kidnapped them
from their fathers' custody and therefore no one would agree to marry them. According to Vedic society,
girls are transferred from the custody of the father to the custody of the husband. Since these princesses
had already been taken away from the custody of their fathers, it would have been difficult for them to
have any husband other than the Lord Himself.
