TRANSLATION
I am not astonished at this, having traveled over the world without being seen by others. The activities
of the Personality of Godhead, which are like those of a man in this mortal world, are bewildering to
others, but I know of His greatness by His grace, and thus I am happy in all respects.
PURPORT
Although he was the brother of Dhrtarastra, Vidura was completely different. By the grace of Lord
Krsna, he was not foolish like his brother, and thus his brother's association could not influence him.
Dhrtarastra and his materialistic sons wanted to falsely lord it over the world by dint of their own
strength. The Lord encouraged them in this, and thus they became more and more bewildered. But Vidura
wanted to achieve sincere devotional service of the Lord and therefore became a soul absolutely
surrendered to the Absolute Personality of Godhead. He could realize this in the progress of his pilgrim's
journey, and thus he was freed from all doubts. He was not at all sorry to be bereft of his hearth and home
because he now had experience that dependence on the mercy of the Lord is a greater freedom than socalled
freedom at home. A person should not be in the renounced order of life unless he is firmly
convinced of being protected by the Lord. This stage of life is explained in Bhagavad-gita as abhayam
sattva-samsuddhih: every living entity is factually completely dependent on the mercy of the Lord, but
unless one is in the pure state of existence, he cannot be established in this position. This stage of
dependence is called sattva-samsuddhih, or purification of one's existence. The result of such purification
is exhibited in fearlessness. A devotee of the Lord, who is called narayana-para, is never afraid of anything
because he is always aware of the fact that the Lord protects him in all circumstances. With this
conviction, Vidura traveled alone, and he was not seen or recognized by any friend or foe. Thus he
enjoyed freedom of life without obligation to the many duties of the world.
When Lord Sri Krsna was personally present in the mortal world in His eternal, blissful form of
Syamasundara, those who were not pure devotees of the Lord could not recognize Him or know His
glories. Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg. 9.11): He is always bewildering to the
nondevotees, but He is always seen by the devotees by dint of their pure devotional service to Him.
