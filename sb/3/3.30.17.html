<h2>Translation</h2>
Fallen into a pool of blood, stool and urine within the abdomen of his mother, his own body scorched
by the mother's gastric fire, the embodied soul, anxious to get out, counts his months and prays, "O my
Lord, when shall I, a wretched soul, be released from this confinement?"
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The precarious condition of the living entity within the womb of his mother is described here. On one
side of where the child is floating is the heat of gastric fire, and on the other side are urine, stool, blood
and discharges. After seven months the child, who has regained his consciousness, feels the horrible
condition of his existence and prays to the Lord. Counting the months until his release, he becomes
greatly anxious to get out of the confinement. The so-called civilized man does not take account of this
horrible condition of life, and sometimes, for the purpose of sense gratification, he tries to kill the child by
methods of contraception or abortion. Unserious about the horrible condition in the womb, such persons
continue in materialism, grossly misusing the chance of the human form of life.
The word krpana-dhih is significant in this verse. Dhi means "intelligence," and krpana means
"miserly." Conditional life is for persons who are of miserly intelligence or who do not properly utilize
their intelligence. In the human form of life the intelligence is developed, and one has to utilize that
developed intelligence to get out of the cycle of birth and death. One who does not do so is a miser, just
like a person who has immense wealth but does not utilize it, keeping it simply to see. A person who does
not actually utilize his human intelligence to get out of the clutches of maya, the cycle of birth and death,
is accepted as miserly. The exact opposite of miserly is udara, "very magnanimous." A brahmana is called
udara because he utilizes his human intelligence for spiritual realization. He uses that intelligence to
preach Krsna consciousness for the benefit of the public, and therefore he is magnanimous.
