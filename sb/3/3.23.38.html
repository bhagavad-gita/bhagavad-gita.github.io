<h2>Text</h2>

vidyadharibhir upacirna-vapur vimane
babhraja utkaca-kumud-ganavan apicyas
tarabhir avrta ivodu-patir nabhah-sthah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmin--in that; alupta--not lost; mahima--glory; priyaya--with his beloved consort; anuraktah--attached;
vidyadharibhih--by the Gandharva girls; upacirna--waited upon; vapuh--his person; vimane--on the
airplane; babhraja--he shone; utkaca--open; kumut-ganavan--the moon, which is followed by rows of
lilies; apicyah--very charming; tarabhih--by stars; avrtah--surrounded; iva--as; udu-patih--the moon (the
chief of the stars); nabhah-sthah--in the sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Though seemingly attached to his beloved consort while served by the Gandharva girls, the sage did not
lose his glory, which was mastery over his self. In the aerial mansion Kardama Muni with his consort
shone as charmingly as the moon in the midst of the stars in the sky, which causes rows of lilies to open
in ponds at night.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The mansion was in the sky, and therefore the comparison to the full moon and stars is very beautifully
composed in this verse. Kardama Muni looked like the full moon, and the girls who surrounded his wife,
Devahuti, seemed just like the stars. On a full-moon night the stars and the moon together form a
beautiful constellation; similarly, in that aerial mansion in the sky, Kardama Muni with his beautiful wife
and the damsels surrounding them appeared like the moon and stars on a full-moon night.
