TRANSLATION
Such nondevotees engage their senses in very troublesome and extensive work, and they suffer insomnia
at night because their intelligence constantly breaks their sleep with various mental speculations. They are
frustrated in all their various plans by supernatural power. Even great sages, if they are against Your
transcendental topics, must rotate in this material world.
PURPORT
As described in the previous verse, people who have no taste for the devotional service of the Lord are
occupied in material engagements. Most of them engage during the daytime in hard physical labor; their
senses are engaged very extensively in troublesome duties in the gigantic plants of heavy industrial
enterprise. The owners of such factories are engaged in finding a market for their industrial products, and
the laborers are engaged in extensive production involving huge mechanical arrangements. "Factory" is
another name for hell. At night, hellishly engaged persons take advantage of wine and women to satisfy
their tired senses, but they are not even able to have sound sleep because their various mental speculative
plans constantly interrupt their sleep. Because they suffer from insomnia sometimes they feel sleepy in the
morning for lack of sufficient rest. By the arrangement of supernatural power, even the great scientists and
thinkers of the world suffer frustration of their various plans and thus rot in the material world birth after
birth. A great scientist may make discoveries in atomic energy for the quick destruction of the world and
may be awarded the best prize in recognition of his service (or disservice), but he also has to undergo the
reactions of his work by rotating in the cycle of repeated births and deaths under the superhuman law of
material nature. All these people who are against the principle of devotional service are destined to rotate
in this material world without fail.
This verse particularly mentions that even sages who are averse to the principles of devotional service to
the Lord are also condemned to undergo the terms of material existence. Not only in this age, but
formerly also, there were many sages who tried to invent their own systems of religion without reference
to devotional service to the Supreme Lord, but there cannot be any religious principle without devotional
service to the Lord. The Supreme Lord is the leader of the entire range of living entities, and no one can
be equal to or greater than Him. Even the Lord's impersonal feature and all-pervading localized feature
cannot be on an equal level with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, there cannot be any
religion or system of genuine philosophy for the advancement of the living entities without the principle
of devotional service.
The impersonalists, who take much trouble in penance and austerity for self-liberation, may approach
the impersonal brahmajyoti, but ultimately, because of not being situated in devotional service, they glide
down again to the material world to undergo another term of material existence. This is confirmed as
follows:
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
"Persons who are falsely under the impression of being liberated, without devotional service to the Lord,
may reach the goal of the brahmajyoti, but because of their impure consciousness and for want of shelter
in the Vaikunthalokas, such so-called liberated persons again fall down into material existence." (Bhag.
10.2.32)
Therefore, no one can manufacture any system of religion without the principle of devotional service to
the Lord. As we find in the Sixth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the initiator of religious principles is the
Lord Himself. In Bhagavad-gita also we find that the Lord condemns all forms of religion other than that
which entails the process of surrendering unto the Supreme. Any system which leads one to the
devotional service of the Lord, and nothing else, is actually religion or philosophy. In the Sixth Canto we
find the following statements of Yamaraja, the controller of all unfaithful living entities:
dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam
na vai vidur rsayo napi devah
na siddha-mukhya asura manusyah
kuto nu vidyadhara-caranadayah
svayambhur naradah sambhuh
kumarah kapilo manuh
prahlado janako bhismo
balir vaiyasakir vayam
dvadasaite vijanimo
dharmam bhagavatam bhatah
guhyam visuddham durbodham
yam jnatvamrtam asnute
"The principles of religion are initiated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else,
including the sages and demigods, can manufacture any such principles. Since even great sages and
demigods are unauthorized to inaugurate such principles of religion, what to speak of others--the socalled
mystics, demons, human beings, Vidyadharas and Caranas living in the lower planets? Twelve
personalities--Brahma, Narada, Lord Siva, Kumara, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada Maharaja, Janaka Maharaja,
Bhisma, Bali, Sukadeva Gosvami and Yamaraja--are agents of the Lord authorized to speak and propagate
the principles of religion." (Bhag. 6.3.19-21)
The principles of religion are not open to any ordinary living entity. They are just to bring the human
being onto the platform of morality. Nonviolence, etc., are necessary for misguided persons because
unless one is moral and nonviolent one cannot understand the principles of religion. To understand what
is actually religion is very difficult even if one is situated in the principles of morality and nonviolence. It
is very confidential because as soon as one is conversant with the real principles of religion, he is at once
liberated to the eternal life of bliss and knowledge. Therefore, one who is not situated in the principles of
devotional service to the Lord should not pose himself as a religious leader of the innocent public. The
Isopanisad emphatically forbids this nonsense in the following mantra:
andham tamah pravisanti
ye 'sambhutim upasate
tato bhuya iva te tamo
ya u sambhutyam ratah
(Isopanisad 12)
A person in ignorance of the principles of religion who therefore does nothing in the matter of religion
is far better than a person who misguides others in the name of religion without reference to the factual
religious principles of devotional service. Such so-called leaders of religion are sure to be condemned by
Brahma and other great authorities.
