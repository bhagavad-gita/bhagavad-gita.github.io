drsta bhavadbhir nanu rajasuye
caidyasya krsnam dvisato 'pi siddhih
yam yoginah samsprhayanti samyag
yogena kas tad-viraham saheta
SYNONYMS
drsta--it has been seen; bhavadbhih--by your good self; nanu--of course; rajasuye--in the assembly of the
rajasuya sacrifice performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira; caidyasya--of the King of Cedi (Sisupala); krsnam--
unto Krsna; dvisatah--envying; api--in spite of; siddhih--success; yam--which; yoginah--the yogis;
samsprhayanti--verily desire; samyak--fully; yogena--by performance of yoga; kah--who; tat--His;
viraham--separation; saheta--can tolerate.
TRANSLATION
You have personally seen how the King of Cedi [Sisupala] achieved success in yoga practice, although
he hated Lord Krsna. Even the actual yogis aspire after such success with great interest by performance of
their various practices. Who can tolerate separation from Him?
PURPORT
Lord Krsna's causeless mercy was exhibited in the great assembly of Maharaja Yudhisthira. He was
merciful even to His enemy the King of Cedi, who always tried to be an envious rival of the Lord. Because
it is not possible to be a bona fide rival of the Lord, the King of Cedi was extremely malicious toward Lord
Krsna. In this he was like many other asuras, such as Kamsa and Jarasandha. In the open assembly of the
rajasuya sacrifice performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira, Sisupala insulted Lord Krsna, and he was finally
killed by the Lord. But it was seen by everyone in the assembly that a light flashed out of the body of the
King of Cedi and merged into the body of Lord Krsna. This means that Cediraja achieved the salvation of
attaining oneness with the Supreme, which is a perfection most desired by the jnanis and yogis and for
which they execute their different types of transcendental activities.
It is a fact that persons who are trying to understand the Supreme Truth by their personal endeavors of
mental speculation or mystic powers of yoga achieve the same goal as others who are personally killed by
the Lord. Both achieve the salvation of merging in the brahmajyoti rays of the transcendental body of the
Lord. The Lord was merciful even to His enemy, and the success of the King of Cedi was observed by
everyone who was present in the assembly. Vidura was also present there, and therefore Uddhava referred
the incident to his memory.
