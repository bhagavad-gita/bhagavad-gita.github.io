<h2>Purport</h2>
It has already been stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, Second Chapter, that the highest,
most glorious religion is the attainment of causeless, unmotivated devotional service. In pure devotional
service, the only motive should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is not actually a
motive; that is the pure condition of the living entity. In the conditioned stage, when one engages in
devotional service, he should follow the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master in full surrender. The
spiritual master is the manifested representation of the Supreme Lord because he receives and presents the
instructions of the Lord, as they are, by disciplic succession. It is described in Bhagavad-gita that the
teachings therein should be received by disciplic succession, otherwise there is adulteration. To act under
the direction of a bona fide spiritual master with a motive to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead
is pure devotional service. But if one has a motive for personal sense gratification, his devotional service is
manifested differently. Such a man may be violent, proud, envious and angry, and his interests are
separate from the Lord's.
One who approaches the Supreme Lord to render devotional service, but who is proud of his
personality, envious of others or vengeful, is in the mode of anger. He thinks that he is the best devotee.
Devotional service executed in this way is not pure; it is mixed and is of the lowest grade, tamasah. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura advises that a Vaisnava who is not of good character should be avoided. A
Vaisnava is one who has taken the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life, but if one
is not pure and still has motives, then he is not a Vaisnava of the first order of good character. One may
offer his respects to such a Vaisnava because he has accepted the Supreme Lord as the ultimate goal of life,
but one should not keep company with a Vaisnava who is in the mode of ignorance.
