<h2>Translation</h2>
O my friend, please, therefore, chant the glories of the Lord, who is meant to be glorified in the places of
pilgrimage. He is unborn, and yet He appears by His causeless mercy upon the surrendered rulers of all
parts of the universe. Only for their interest did He appear in the family of His unalloyed devotees the
Yadus.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are innumerable rulers all over the universe in different varieties of planets: the sun-god in the
sun planet, the moon-god in the moon planet, Indra in the heavenly planet, Vayu, Varuna, and those in
the Brahmaloka planet, where Lord Brahma is living. All are obedient servants of the Lord. Whenever
there is any trouble in the administration of the innumerable planets in different universes, the rulers pray
for an appearance, and the Lord appears. The Bhagavatam (1.3.28) has already confirmed this in the
following verse:
ete camsa-kalah pumsah
krsnas tu bhagavan svayam
indrari-vyakulam lokam
mrdayanti yuge yuge
In every millennium, whenever there is any trouble for the obedient rulers, the Lord appears. He also
appears for the sake of His pure unalloyed devotees. The surrendered rulers and the pure devotees are
always strictly under the control of the Lord, and they are never disobedient to the desires of the Lord.
The Lord is therefore always attentive to them.
The purpose of pilgrimages is to remember the Lord constantly, and therefore the Lord is known as
tirtha-kirti. The purpose of going to a place of pilgrimage is to get the chance to glorify the Lord. Even
today, although times have changed, there are still pilgrimage sites in India. For example, in Mathura and
Vrndavana, where we had a chance to stay, people are awake from early in the morning at 4 A.M. up until
nighttime and are constantly engaged, some way or other, in chanting the holy glories of the Lord. The
beauty of such a pilgrimage site is that automatically one remembers the holy glories of the Lord. His
name, fame, quality, form, pastimes and entourage are all identical to the Lord, and therefore chanting the
glories of the Lord invokes the personal presence of the Lord. Any time or anywhere pure devotees meet
and chant the glories of the Lord, the Lord is present without any doubt. It is said by the Lord Himself
that He always stays where His pure devotees chant His glories.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, First Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Questions by Vidura."
Chapter Two
Remembrance of Lord Krsna
