<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kala--Kalayavana; magadha--the King of Magadha (Jarasandha); salva--King Salva; adin--and others;
anikaih--by the soldiers; rundhatah--being encircled; puram--the city of Mathura; ajighanat--killed;
svayam--personally; divyam--transcendental; sva-pumsam--of His own men; tejah--prowess; adisat--
exhibited.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kalayavana, the King of Magadha and Salva attacked the city of Mathura, but when the city was
encircled by their soldiers, the Lord refrained from killing them personally, just to show the power of His
own men.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
After the death of Kamsa, when Mathura was encircled by the soldiers of Kalayavana, Jarasandha and
Salva, the Lord seemingly fled from the city, and thus He is known as Ranchor, or one who fled from
fighting. Actually, the fact was that the Lord wanted to kill them through the agency of His own men,
devotees like Mucukunda and Bhima. Kalayavana and the King of Magadha were killed by Mucukunda
and Bhima respectively, who acted as agents of the Lord. By such acts the Lord wanted to exhibit the
prowess of His devotees, as if He were personally unable to fight but His devotees could kill them. The
relationship of the Lord with His devotees is a very happy one. Actually, the Lord descended at the
request of Brahma in order to kill all the undesirables of the world, but to divide the share of glory He
sometimes engaged His devotees to take the credit. The Battle of Kuruksetra was designed by the Lord
Himself, but just to give credit to His devotee Arjuna (nimitta-matram bhava savyasacin), He played the
part of the charioteer, while Arjuna was given the chance to play the fighter and thus become the hero of
the Battle of Kuruksetra. What He wants to do Himself by His transcendental plans, He executes through
His confidential devotees. That is the way of the Lord's mercy towards His pure unalloyed devotees.
