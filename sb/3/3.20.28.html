TRANSLATION
Brahma continued: He was struck by a forefoot of the Lord, whom yogis, seeking freedom from their
unreal material bodies, meditate upon in seclusion in mystic trance. While gazing on His countenance,
this crest jewel of Diti's sons has cast off his mortal coil.
PURPORT
The process of yoga is very clearly described in this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam. It is said here that the
ultimate end of the yogis and mystics who perform meditation is to get rid of this material body.
Therefore they meditate in secluded places to attain yogic trance. Yoga has to be performed in a secluded
place, not in public or in a demonstration on stage, as nowadays practiced by many so-called yogis. Real
yoga aims at ridding one of the material body. Yoga practice is not intended to keep the body fit and
young. Such advertisements of so-called yoga are not approved by any standard method. Particularly
mentioned in this verse is the word yam, or "unto whom," indicating that meditation should be targeted
on the Personality of Godhead. Even if one concentrates his mind on the boar form of the Lord, that is
also yoga. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, one who concentrates his mind constantly in meditation upon
the Personality of Godhead in one of His many varieties of forms is the first-class yogi, and he can very
easily attain trance simply by meditating upon the form of the Lord. If one is able to continue such
meditation on the Lord's form at the time of one's death, one is liberated from this mortal body and is
transferred to the kingdom of God. This opportunity was given to the demon by the Lord, and therefore
Brahma and other demigods were astonished. In other words, the perfection of yoga practice can be
attained by a demon also if he is simply kicked by the Lord.
