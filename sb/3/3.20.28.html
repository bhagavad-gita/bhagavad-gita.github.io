<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, who can distinctly see the minds of others, perceived Brahma's distress and said to him: "Cast
off this impure body of yours." Thus commanded by the Lord, Brahma cast off his body.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is described here by the word viviktadhyatma-darsanah. If anyone can completely perceive
another's distress without doubt, it is the Lord Himself. If someone is in distress and wants to get relief
from his friend, sometimes it so happens that his friend does not appreciate the volume of distress he is
suffering. But for the Supreme Lord it is not difficult. The Supreme Lord, as Paramatma, is sitting within
the heart of every living entity, and He directly perceives the exact causes of distress. In Bhagavad-gita the
Lord says, sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah: "I am sitting in everyone's heart, and because of Me one's
remembrance and forgetfulness occur." Thus whenever one fully surrenders unto the Supreme Lord, one
finds that He is sitting within one's heart. He can give us direction how to get out of dangers or how to
approach Him in devotional service. The Lord, however, asked Brahma to give up his present body
because it had created the demoniac principle. According to Sridhara Svami, Brahma's constant dropping
of his body does not refer to his actually giving up his body. Rather, he suggests that Brahma gave up a
particular mentality. Mind is the subtle body of the living entity. We may sometimes be absorbed in some
thought which is sinful, but if we give up the sinful thought, it may be said that we give up the body.
Brahma's mind was not in correct order when he created the demons. It must have been full of passion
because the entire creation was passionate; therefore such passionate sons were born. It follows that any
father and mother should also be careful while begetting children. The mental condition of a child
depends upon the mental status of his parents at the time he is conceived. According to the Vedic system,
therefore, the garbhadhana-samskara, or the ceremony for giving birth to a child, is observed. Before
begetting a child, one has to sanctify his perplexed mind. When the parents engage their minds in the
lotus feet of the Lord and in such a state the child is born, naturally good devotee children come; when
the society is full of such good population, there is no trouble from demoniac mentalities.
