<h2>Translation</h2>
When the Kumaras, although by far the fittest persons, were thus forbidden entrance by the two chief
doorkeepers of Sri Hari while other divinities looked on, their eyes suddenly turned red because of anger
due to their great eagerness to see their most beloved master, Sri Hari, the Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to the Vedic system, a sannyasi, a person in the renounced order of life, is dressed in saffroncolored
garments. This saffron dress is practically a passport for the mendicant and sannyasi to go
anywhere. The sannyasi's duty is to enlighten people in Krsna consciousness. Those in the renounced
order of life have no other business but preaching the glories and supremacy of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Therefore the Vedic sociological conception is that a sannyasi should not be restricted; he is
allowed to go anywhere and everywhere he wants, and he is not refused any gift he might demand from a
householder. The four Kumaras came to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana. The word
suhrttama, "best of all friends," is important. As Lord Krsna states in the Bhagavad-gita, He is the best
friend of all living entities. Suhrdam sarva-bhutanam. No one can be a greater well-wishing friend to any
living entity than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is so kindly disposed towards everyone that in
spite of our completely forgetting our relationship with the Supreme Lord, He comes Himself--sometimes
personally, as Lord Krsna appeared on this earth, and sometimes as His devotee, as did Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu--and sometimes He sends His bona fide devotees to reclaim all the fallen souls. Therefore,
He is the greatest well-wishing friend of everyone, and the Kumaras wanted to see Him. The doorkeepers
should have known that the four sages had no other business, and therefore to restrict them from entering
the palace was not apt.
In this verse it is figuratively stated that the younger brother of desire suddenly appeared in person
when the sages were forbidden to see their most beloved Personality of Godhead. The younger brother of
desire is anger. If one's desire is not fulfilled, the younger brother, anger, follows. Here we can mark that
even great saintly persons like the Kumaras were also angry, but they were not angry for their personal
interests. They were angry because they were forbidden to enter the palace to see the Personality of
Godhead. Therefore the theory that in the perfectional stage one should not have anger is not supported
in this verse. Anger will continue even in the liberated stage. These four mendicant brothers, the
Kumaras, were considered liberated persons, but still they were angry because they were restricted in their
service to the Lord. The difference between the anger of an ordinary person and that of a liberated person
is that an ordinary person becomes angry because his sense desires are not being fulfilled, whereas a
liberated person like the Kumaras becomes angry when restricted in the discharge of duties for serving the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In the previous verse it has been clearly mentioned that the Kumaras were liberated persons. Viditatmatattva
means "one who understands the truth of self-realization." One who does not understand the truth
of self-realization is called ignorant, but one who understands the self, the Superself, their interrelation,
and activities in self-realization is called viditatma-tattva. Although the Kumaras were already liberated
persons, they nevertheless became angry. This point is very important. Becoming liberated does not
necessitate losing one's sensual activities. Sense activities continue even in the liberated stage. The
difference is, however, that sense activities in liberation are accepted only in connection with Krsna
consciousness, whereas sense activities in the conditioned stage are enacted for personal sense
gratification.
