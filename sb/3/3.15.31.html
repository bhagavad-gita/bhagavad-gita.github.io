sa viditvatha bharyayas
tam nirbandham vikarmani
natva distaya rahasi
tayathopavivesa hi
SYNONYMS
sah--he; viditva--understanding; atha--thereupon; bharyayah--of the wife; tam--that; nirbandham--
obstinacy; vikarmani--in the forbidden act; natva--offering obeisances; distaya--unto worshipable fate;
rahasi--in a secluded place; taya--with her; atha--thus; upavivesa--lay; hi--certainly.
TRANSLATION
Understanding his wife's purpose, he was obliged to perform the forbidden act, and thus after offering
his obeisances unto worshipable fate, he lay with her in a secluded place.
PURPORT
It appears from the talks of Kasyapa with his wife that he was a worshiper of Lord Siva, and although he
knew that Lord Siva would not be pleased with him for such a forbidden act, he was obliged to act by his
wife's desire, and thus he offered his obeisances unto fate. He knew that the child born of such untimely
sexual intercourse would certainly not be a good child, but could not protect himself because he was too
obligated to his wife. In a similar case, however, when Thakura Haridasa was tempted by a public
prostitute at the dead of night, he avoided the allurement because of his perfection in Krsna
consciousness. That is the difference between a Krsna conscious person and others. Kasyapa Muni was
greatly learned and enlightened, and he knew all the rules and regulations of systematic life, yet he failed
to protect himself from the attack of sex desire. Thakura Haridasa was not born of a brahmana family, nor
was he himself brahmana, yet he could protect himself from such an attack due to his being Krsna
conscious. Thakura Haridasa used to chant the holy name of the Lord three hundred thousand times
daily.
