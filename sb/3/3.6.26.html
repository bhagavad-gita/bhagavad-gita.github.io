purusenatma-bhutena
viryam adhatta viryavan
SYNONYMS
kala--the eternal time; vrttya--by the influence of; tu--but; mayayam--in the external energy; gunamayyam--
in the qualitative modes of nature; adhoksajah--the Transcendence; purusena--by the purusa
incarnation; atma-bhutena--who is the plenary expansion of the Lord; viryam--the seeds of the living
entities; adhatta--impregnated; viryavan--the Supreme Living Being.
TRANSLATION
The Supreme Living Being in His feature as the transcendental purusa incarnation, who is the Lord's
plenary expansion, impregnates the material nature of three modes, and thus by the influence of eternal
time the living entities appear.
PURPORT
The offspring of any living being is born after the father impregnates the mother with semen, and the
living entity floating in the semen of the father takes the shape of the mother's form. Similarly, mother
material nature cannot produce any living entity from her material elements unless and until she is
impregnated with living entities by the Lord Himself. That is the mystery of the generation of the living
entities. This impregnating process is performed by the first purusa incarnation, Karanarnavasayi Visnu.
Simply by His glance over material nature, the whole matter is accomplished.
We should not understand the process of impregnation by the Personality of Godhead in terms of our
conception of sex. The omnipotent Lord can impregnate just by His eyes, and therefore He is called allpotent.
Each and every part of His transcendental body can perform each and every function of the other
parts. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.32): angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti. In Bhagavadgita
(14.3) also, the same principle is confirmed: mama yonir mahad-brahma tasmin garbham dadhamy
aham. When the cosmic creation is manifested, the living entities are directly supplied from the Lord;
they are never products of material nature. Thus, no scientific advancement of material science can ever
produce a living being. That is the whole mystery of the material creation. The living entities are foreign
to matter, and thus they cannot be happy unless they are situated in the same spiritual life as the Lord.
The mistaken living being, out of forgetfulness of this original condition of life, unnecessarily wastes time
trying to become happy in the material world. The whole Vedic process is to remind one of this essential
feature of life. The Lord offers the conditioned soul a material body for his so-called enjoyment, but if one
does not come to his senses and enter into spiritual consciousness, the Lord again puts him in the
unmanifested condition as it existed in the beginning of the creation. The Lord is described here as
viryavan, or the greatest potent being, because He impregnates material nature with innumerable living
entities who are conditioned from time immemorial.
