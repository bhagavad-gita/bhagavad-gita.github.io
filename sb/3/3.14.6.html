<h2>Translation</h2>
By hearing these topics from the sage [Narada], the son of King Uttanapada [Dhruva] was enlightened
regarding the Personality of Godhead, and he ascended to the abode of the Lord, placing his feet over the
head of death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
While quitting his body, Maharaja Dhruva, the son of King Uttanapada, was attended by personalities
like Sunanda and others, who received him in the kingdom of God. He left this world at an early age, as a
young boy, although he had attained the throne of his father and had several children of his own. Because
he was due to quit this world, death was waiting for him. He did not care for death, however, and even
with his present body he boarded a spiritual airplane and went directly to the planet of Visnu because of
his association with the great sage Narada, who had spoken to him the narration of the pastimes of the
Lord.
