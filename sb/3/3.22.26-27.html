<h2>Translation</h2>
After asking and obtaining the great sage's permission to leave, the monarch mounted his chariot with
his wife and started for his capital, followed by his retinue. Along the way he saw the prosperity of the
tranquil seers' beautiful hermitages on both the charming banks of the Sarasvati, the river so agreeable to
saintly persons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As cities are constructed in the modern age with great engineering and architectural craftsmanship, so
in days gone by there were neighborhoods called rsi-kulas, where great saintly persons resided. In India
there are still many magnificent places for spiritual understanding; there are many rsis and saintly persons
living in nice cottages on the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna for purposes of spiritual cultivation. While
passing through the rsi-kulas the King and his party were very much satisfied with the beauty of the
cottages and hermitages. It is stated here, pasyann asrama-sampadah. The great sages had no skyscrapers,
but the hermitages were so beautiful that the King was very much pleased at the sight.
