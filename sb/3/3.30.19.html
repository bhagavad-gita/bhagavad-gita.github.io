<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity in another type of body sees only by instinct; he knows only the agreeable and
disagreeable sense perceptions of that particular body. But I have a body in which I can control my senses
and can understand my destination; therefore, I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, by whom I have been blessed with this body and by whose grace I can see Him within and
without.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The evolutionary process of different types of bodies is something like that of a fructifying flower. Just
as there are different stages in the growth of a flower--the bud stage, the blooming stage and the full
species of bodies in gradual evolution, and there is systematic progress from the lower species of life to
the higher. The human form of life is supposed to be the highest, for it offers consciousness for getting
out of the clutches of birth and death. The fortunate child in the womb of his mother realizes his superior
position and is thereby distinguished from other bodies. Animals in bodies lower than that of the human
being are conscious only as far as their bodily distress and happiness are concerned; they cannot think of
more than their bodily necessities of life--eating, sleeping, mating and defending. But in the human form
of life, by the grace of God, the consciousness is so developed that a man can evaluate his exceptional
position and thus realize the self and the Supreme Lord.
The word dama-sariri means that we have a body in which we can control the senses and the mind. The
complication of materialistic life is due to an uncontrolled mind and uncontrolled senses. One should feel
grateful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having obtained such a nice human form of body, and
one should properly utilize it. The distinction between an animal and a man is that the animal cannot
control himself and has no sense of decency, whereas the human being has the sense of decency and can
control himself. If this controlling power is not exhibited by the human being, then he is no better than
an animal. By controlling the senses, or by the process of yoga regulation, one can understand the
position of his self, the Supersoul, the world and their interrelation; everything is possible by controlling
the senses. Otherwise, we are no better than animals.
Real self-realization by means of controlling the senses is explained herein. One should try to see the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and one's own self also. To think oneself the same as the Supreme is not
self-realization. Here it is clearly explained that the Supreme Lord is anadi, or purana, and He has no
other cause. The living entity is born of the Supreme Godhead as part and parcel. It is confirmed in the
Brahma-samhita, anadir adir govindah: Govinda, the Supreme person, has no cause. He is unborn. But the
living entity is born of Him. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, mamaivamsah: both the living entity and the
Supreme Lord are unborn, but it has to be understood that the supreme cause of the part and parcel is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma-samhita therefore says that everything has come from the
Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-karana-karanam). The Vedanta-sutra confirms this also. Janmady
asya yatah: the Absolute Truth is the original source of everyone's birth. Krsna also says in Bhagavad-gita,
aham sarvasya prabhavah: "I am the source of birth of everything, including Brahma and Lord Siva and
the living entities." This is self-realization. One should know that he is under the control of the Supreme
Lord and not think that he is fully independent. Otherwise, why should he be put into conditional life?
