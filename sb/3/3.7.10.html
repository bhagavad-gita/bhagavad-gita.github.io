<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The living entity is in distress regarding his self-identity. He has no factual background, like a man who
dreams that he sees his head cut off.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A teacher in school once threatened his pupil that he would cut off the pupil's head and hang it on the
wall so that the child could see how his head had been cut off. The child became frightened and stopped
his mischief. Similarly, the miseries of the pure soul and the disruption of his self-identification are
managed by the external energy of the Lord, which controls those mischievous living entities who want to
go against the will of the Lord. Actually there is no bondage or misery for the living entity, nor does he
ever lose his pure knowledge. In his pure consciousness, when he thinks a little seriously about his
position, he can understand that he is eternally subordinate to the mercy of the Supreme and that his
attempt to become one with the Supreme Lord is a false illusion. Life after life the living entity falsely tries
to lord it over material nature and become the lord of the material world, but there is no tangible result.
At last, when frustrated, he gives up his material activities and tries to become one with the Lord and
speculate with much jugglery of words, but without success.
These activities are performed under the dictation of the illusory energy. The experience is compared to
the experience of one's having his head cut off in a dream. The man whose head has been cut off also sees
that his head has been cut off. If a person's head is severed he loses his power to see. Therefore if a man
sees that his head has been cut off, it means that he thinks like that in hallucination. Similarly a living
entity is eternally subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and he has this knowledge with him, but, artificially,
he thinks that he is God himself and that although he is God he has lost his knowledge due to maya. This
conception has no meaning, just as there is no meaning to seeing one's head being cut off. This is the
process by which knowledge is covered. And because this artificial rebellious condition of the living entity
gives him all troubles, it is to be understood that he should take to his normal life as a devotee of the Lord
and be relieved from the misconception of being God. The so-called liberation of thinking oneself God is
that last reaction of avidya by which the living entity is entrapped. The conclusion is that a living entity
deprived of eternal transcendental service to the Lord becomes illusioned in many ways. Even in his
conditional life he is the eternal servant of the Lord. His servitude under the spell of illusory maya is also
a manifestation of his eternal condition of service. Because he has rebelled against the service of the Lord,
he is therefore put in the service of the maya. He is still serving, but in a perverted manner. When he
wants to get out of service under material bondage, he next desires to become one with the Lord. This is
another illusion. The best course, therefore, is to surrender unto the Lord and thus get rid of the illusory
maya for good, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):
daivi hy esa guna-mayi
mama maya duratyaya
mam eva ye prapadyante
mayam etam taranti te
