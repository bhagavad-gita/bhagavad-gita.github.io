SYNONYMS
smaran--remembering; visva-srjam--of the demigods entrusted with the task of cosmic construction;
isah--the Supreme Lord; vijnapitam--as He was prayed for; adhoksajah--the Transcendence; virajam--the

vivrttaye--for understanding.
TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord is the Supersoul of all the demigods entrusted with the task of constructing the
cosmic manifestation. Being thus prayed to [by the demigods], He thought to Himself and thus
manifested the gigantic form for their understanding.
PURPORT
The impersonalists are captivated by the gigantic universal form of the Supreme. They think that the
control behind this gigantic manifestation is imagination. Intelligent persons, however, can estimate the
value of the cause by observing the wonders of the effects. For example, the individual human body does
not develop from the womb of the mother independently but because the living entity, the soul, is within
the body. Without the living entity, a material body cannot automatically take shape or develop. When
any material object displays development, it must be understood that there is a spiritual soul within the
manifestation. The gigantic universe has developed gradually, just as the body of a child develops. The
conception that the Transcendence enters within the universe is, therefore, logical. As the materialists
cannot find the soul and the Supersoul within the heart, similarly, for want of sufficient knowledge, they
cannot see that the Supreme Soul is the cause of the universe. The Lord is therefore described in the Vedic
language as avan-manasa-gocarah, beyond the conception of words and minds.
Due to a poor fund of knowledge, the mental speculators try to bring the Supreme within the purview of
words and minds, but the Lord refuses to be so intelligible; the speculator has no adequate words or mind
to gauge the infinity of the Lord. The Lord is called adhoksaja, or the person who is beyond perception by
the blunt, limited potency of our senses. One cannot perceive the transcendental name or form of the
Lord by mental speculation. The mundane Ph.D.'s are completely unable to speculate on the Supreme
with their limited senses. Such attempts by the puffed up Ph.D's are compared to the philosophy of the
frog in the well. A frog in a well was informed of the gigantic Pacific Ocean, and he began to puff himself
up in order to understand or measure the length and breadth of the Pacific Ocean. Ultimately the frog
burst and died. The title Ph.D. can also be interpreted as Plough Department, a title meant for the tillers
in the paddy field. The attempt of the tillers in the paddy field to understand the cosmic manifestation and
the cause behind such wonderful work can be compared to the endeavor of the frog in the well to
calculate the measurement of the Pacific Ocean.
The Lord can reveal Himself only to a person who is submissive and who engages in His transcendental
loving service. The demigods controlling the elements and ingredients of universal affairs prayed to the
Lord for guidance, and thus He manifested His gigantic form, as He did at the request of Arjuna.
