<h2>Text</h2>
dvaipayanad anavaro
mahitve tasya dehajah
sarvatmana sritah krsnam
tat-params capy anuvratah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dvaipayanat--from Vyasadeva; anavarah--in no way inferior; mahitve--in greatness; tasya--his (Vyasa's);
deha-jah--born of his body; sarva-atmana--with all his heart; sritah--took shelter; krsnam--Lord Krsna; tatparan--
those devoted to Him; ca--and; api--also; anuvratah--followed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Vidura was born from the body of Veda-vyasa and was not less than he. Thus he accepted the lotus feet
of Krsna wholeheartedly and was attached to His devotees.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The history of Vidura is that he was born of a sudra mother, but his seminal father was Vyasadeva; thus
he was not less than Vyasadeva in any respect. Since he was born of a great father, who was supposed to
be an incarnation of Narayana and who composed all the Vedic literatures, Vidura was also a great
personality. He accepted Krsna as his worshipable Lord and followed His instructions wholeheartedly.
