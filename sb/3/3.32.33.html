yathendriyaih prthag-dvarair
artho bahu-gunasrayah
eko naneyate tadvad
bhagavan sastra-vartmabhih
SYNONYMS
yatha--as; indriyaih--by the senses; prthak-dvaraih--in different ways; arthah--an object; bahu-guna--
many qualities; asrayah--endowed with; ekah--one; nana--differently; iyate--is perceived; tadvat--similarly;
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sastra-vartmabhih--according to different scriptural
injunctions.
TRANSLATION
A single object is appreciated differently by different senses due to its having different qualities.
Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is one, but according to different scriptural injunctions He
appears to be different.
PURPORT
It appears that by following the path of jnana-yoga, or empiric philosophical speculation, one reaches
the impersonal Brahman, whereas by executing devotional service in Krsna consciousness one enriches
his faith in and devotion to the Personality of Godhead. But it is stated here that both bhakti-yoga and
jnana-yoga are meant for reaching the same destination--the Personality of Godhead. By the process of
jnana-yoga the same Personality of Godhead appears to be impersonal. As the same object appears to be
different when perceived by different senses, the same Supreme Lord appears to be impersonal by mental
speculation. A hill appears cloudy from a distance, and one who does not know may speculate that the
hill is a cloud. Actually, it is not a cloud; it is a big hill. One has to learn from authority that the sight of a
cloud is not actually a cloud but a hill. If one makes a little more progress, then instead of a cloud he sees
the hill and something green. When one actually approaches the hill, he will see many varieties. Another
example is in perceiving milk. When we see milk, we see that it is white; when we taste it, it appears that
milk is very palatable. When we touch milk, it appears very cold; when we smell milk, it appears to have a
very good flavor; and when we hear, we understand that it is called milk. Perceiving milk with different
senses, we say that it is something white, something very delicious, something very aromatic, and so on.
Actually, it is milk. Similarly, those who are trying to find the Supreme Godhead by mental speculation
may approach the bodily effulgence, or the impersonal Brahman, and those who are trying to find the
Supreme Godhead by yoga practice may find Him as the localized Supersoul, but those who are directly
trying to approach the Supreme Truth by practice of bhakti-yoga can see Him face to face as the Supreme
Person.
Ultimately, the Supreme Person is the destination of all different processes. The fortunate person who,
by following the principles of scriptures, becomes completely purified of all material contamination,
surrenders unto the Supreme Lord as everything. Just as one can appreciate the real taste of milk with the
tongue and not with the eyes, nostrils or ears, one can similarly appreciate the Absolute Truth perfectly
and with all relishable pleasure only through one path, devotional service. This is also confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita. Bhaktya mam abhijanati: if one wants to understand the Absolute Truth in perfection, he
must take to devotional service. Of course, no one can understand the Absolute Truth in all perfection.
That is not possible for the infinitesimal living entities. But the highest point of understanding by the
living entity is reached by discharge of devotional service, not otherwise.
By following various scriptural paths, one may come to the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The transcendental pleasure derived from merging with or understanding the
impersonal Brahman is very extensive because Brahman is ananta. Tad brahma niskalam anantam:
brahmananda is unlimited. But that unlimited pleasure can also be surpassed. That is the nature of the
Transcendence. The unlimited can be surpassed also, and that higher platform is Krsna. When one deals
directly with Krsna, the mellow and the humor relished by reciprocation of devotional service is
incomparable, even with the pleasure derived from transcendental Brahman. Prabodhananda Sarasvati
therefore says that kaivalya, the Brahman pleasure, is undoubtedly very great and is appreciated by many
philosophers, but to a devotee, who has understood how to derive pleasure from exchanging devotional
service with the Lord, this unlimited Brahman appears to be hellish. One should try, therefore, to
transcend even the Brahman pleasure in order to approach the position of dealing with Krsna face to face.
As the mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, Krsna is called the master of the senses,
Hrsikesa. The process is to fix the mind on Hrsikesa, or Krsna, as Maharaja Ambarisa did (sa vai manah
krsna-padaravindayoh). Bhakti is the basic principle of all processes. Without bhakti, neither jnana-yoga
nor astanga-yoga can be successful, and unless one approaches Krsna, the principles of self-realization
have no ultimate destination.

TRANSLATION
By performing fruitive activities and sacrifices, by distributing charity, by performing austerities, by
studying various literatures, by conducting philosophical research, by controlling the mind, by subduing
the senses, by accepting the renounced order of life and by performing the prescribed duties of one's
social order; by performing the different divisions of yoga practice, by performing devotional service and
by exhibiting the process of devotional service containing the symptoms of both attachment and
detachment; by understanding the science of self-realization and by developing a strong sense of
detachment, one who is expert in understanding the different processes of self-realization realizes the
Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is represented in the material world as well as in transcendence.
PURPORT
As it is stated in the previous verse, one has to follow the principles of the scriptures. There are different
prescribed duties for persons in the different social and spiritual orders. Here it is stated that performance
of fruitive activities and sacrifices and distribution of charity are activities meant for persons who are in
the householder order of society. There are four orders of the social system: brahmacarya, grhastha,
vanaprastha and sannyasa. For the grhasthas, or householders, performance of sacrifices, distribution of
charity, and action according to prescribed duties are especially recommended. Similarly, austerity, study
of Vedic literature, and philosophical research are meant for the vanaprasthas, or retired persons. Study of
the Vedic literature from the bona fide spiritual master is meant for the brahmacari, or student.
Atmendriya-jaya, control of the mind and taming of the senses, is meant for persons in the renounced
order of life. All these different activities are prescribed for different persons so that they may be elevated
to the platform of self-realization and from there to Krsna consciousness, devotional service.
The words bhakti-yogena caiva hi mean that whatever is to be performed, as described in verse 34,
whether yoga or sacrifice or fruitive activity or study of Vedic literature or philosophical research or
acceptance of the renounced order of life, is to be executed in bhakti-yoga. The words caiva hi, according
to Sanskrit grammar, indicate that one must perform all these activities mixed with devotional service,
otherwise such activities will not produce any fruit. Any prescribed activity must be performed for the
sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.27), yat karosi yad
asnasi: "Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you sacrifice, whatever austerities you undergo and
whatever charities you give, the result should be given to the Supreme Lord." The word eva is added,
indicating that one must execute activities in such a way. Unless one adds devotional service to all
activities, he cannot achieve the desired result, but when bhakti-yoga is prominent in every activity, then
the ultimate goal is sure.
One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as it is stated in Bhagavad-gita: "After
many, many births, one approaches the Supreme Person, Krsna, and surrenders unto Him, knowing that
He is everything." Also in Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam: "For anyone who is
undergoing rigid austerity or for anyone performing different kinds of sacrifices, the beneficiary is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead." He is the proprietor of all planets, and He is the friend of every living
soul.
The words dharmenobhaya-cihnena mean that the bhakti-yoga process contains two symptoms, namely
attachment for the Supreme Lord and detachment from all material affinities. There are two symptoms of
advancement in the process of devotional service, just as there are two processes taking place while
eating. A hungry man feels strength and satisfaction from eating, and at the same time he gradually
becomes detached from eating any more. Similarly, with the execution of devotional service, real
knowledge develops, and one becomes detached from all material activities. In no other activity but
devotional service is there such detachment from matter and attachment for the Supreme. There are nine
different processes to increase this attachment to the Supreme Lord: hearing, chanting, remembering,
worshiping, serving the Lord, making friendship, praying, offering everything and serving the lotus feet of
the Lord. The processes for increasing detachment from material affinities are explained in verse 36.
One can achieve elevation to the higher planetary systems like the heavenly kingdom by executing one's
prescribed duties and by performing sacrifices. When one is transcendental to such desires because of
accepting the renounced order of life, he can understand the Brahman feature of the Supreme, and when
one is able to see his real constitutional position, he sees all other processes and becomes situated in the
stage of pure devotional service. At that time he can understand the Supreme personality of Godhead,
Bhagavan.
Understanding of the Supreme person is called atma-tattva-avabodhena, which means "understanding of
one's real constitutional position." If one actually understands one's constitutional position as an eternal
servitor of the Supreme Lord, he becomes detached from the service of the material world. Everyone
engages in some sort of service. If one does not know one's constitutional position, one engages in the
service of his personal gross body or his family, society or country. But as soon as one is able to see his
constitutional position (the word sva-drk means "one who is able to see"), he becomes detached from
such material service and engages himself in devotional service.
As long as one is in the modes of material nature and is performing the duties prescribed in the
scriptures, he can be elevated to higher planetary systems, where the predominating deities are material
representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, like the sun-god, the moon-god, the air-god,
Brahma and Lord Siva. All the different demigods are material representations of the Supreme Lord. By
material activities one can approach only such demigods, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.25). Yanti devavrata
devan: those who are attached to the demigods and who perform the prescribed duties can approach
the abodes of the demigods. In this way, one can go to the planet of the Pitas, or forefathers. Similarly,
one who fully understands the real position of his life adopts devotional service and realizes the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
