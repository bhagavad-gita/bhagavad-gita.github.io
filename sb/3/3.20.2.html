<h2>Text</h2>
ksatta maha-bhagavatah
krsnasyaikantikah suhrt
yas tatyajagrajam krsne
sapatyam aghavan iti
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ksatta--Vidura; maha-bhagavatah--a great devotee of the Lord; krsnasya--of Lord Krsna; ekantikah--
unalloyed devotee; suhrt--intimate friend; yah--he who; tatyaja--abandoned; agra-jam--his elder brother
(King Dhrtarastra); krsne--toward Krsna; sa-apatyam--along with his one hundred sons; agha-van--
offender; iti--thus.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka Rsi inquired about Vidura, who was a great devotee and friend of Lord Krsna and who gave up
the company of his elder brother because the latter, along with his sons, played tricks against the desires
of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The incident referred to here is that Vidura left the protection of his elder brother Dhrtarastra, went
traveling everywhere to sacred places and met Maitreya at Hardwar. Saunaka Rsi here inquires about the
topics of the conversation between Maitreya Rsi and Vidura. Vidura's qualification was that he was not
only a friend of the Lord but also a great devotee. When Krsna tried to stop the war and mitigate the
misunderstanding between the cousin-brothers, they refused to accept His counsel; therefore Ksatta, or
Vidura, was unsatisfied with them, and he left the palace. As a devotee, Vidura showed by example that
anywhere that Krsna is not honored is a place unfit for human habitation. A devotee may be tolerant
regarding his own interests, but he should not be tolerant when there is misbehavior toward the Lord or
the Lord's devotee. Here the word aghavan is very significant, for it indicates that the Kauravas,
Dhrtarastra's sons, lost the war because of being sinful in disobeying the instructions of Krsna.
