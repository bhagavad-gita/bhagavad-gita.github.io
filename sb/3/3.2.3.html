<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
sa katham sevaya tasya
kalena jarasam gatah
prsto vartam pratibruyad
bhartuh padav anusmaran
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--Uddhava; katham--how; sevaya--by such service; tasya--his; kalena--in course of time; jarasam--
invalidity; gatah--undergone; prstah--asked for; vartam--message; pratibruyat--just to reply; bhartuh--of
the Lord; padau--His lotus feet; anusmaran--remembering.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Uddhava thus served the Lord continually from childhood, and in his old age that attitude of service
never slackened. As soon as he was asked about the message of the Lord, he at once remembered all about
Him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Transcendental service to the Lord is not mundane. The service attitude of the devotee gradually
increases and never becomes slackened. Generally, in old age a person is allowed retirement from
mundane service. But in the transcendental service of the Lord there is no retirement at all; on the
contrary, the service attitude increases more and more with the progress of age. In the transcendental
service there is no satiation, and therefore there is no retirement. Materially, when a man becomes tired
by rendering service in his physical body, he is allowed retirement, but in the transcendental service there
is no feeling of fatigue because it is spiritual service and is not on the bodily plane. Service on the bodily
plane dwindles as the body grows older, but the spirit is never old, and therefore on the spiritual plane the
service is never tiresome.
Uddhava undoubtedly became old, but that does not mean that his spirit became old. His service
attitude matured on the transcendental plane, and therefore as soon as he was questioned by Vidura about
Lord Krsna, he at once remembered his Lord by reference to the context and forgot himself on the
physical plane. That is the sign of pure devotional service to the Lord, as will be explained later on
(laksanam bhakti-yogasya, etc.) in Lord Kapila's instructions to His mother, Devahuti.
