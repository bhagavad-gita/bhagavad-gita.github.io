O Supreme Self, please give us, who are created in the beginning from the mahat-tattva, the total cosmic

so that we can render You service in the different departments of subsequent creation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord creates this material world and impregnates the material energy with the living entities who
will act in the material world. All these actions have a divine plan behind them. The plan is to give the
conditioned souls who so desire a chance to enjoy sense gratification. But there is another plan behind the
creation: to help the living entities realize that they are created for the transcendental sense gratification of
the Lord and not for their individual sense gratification. This is the constitutional position of the living
entities. The Lord is one without a second, and He expands Himself into many for His transcendental
pleasure. All the expansions--the visnu-tattvas, the jiva-tattvas and the sakti-tattvas (the Personalities of
Godhead, the living entities and the different potential energies)-- are different offshoots from the same
one Supreme Lord. The jiva-tattvas are separated expansions of the visnu-tattvas, and although there are
potential differences between them, they are all meant for the transcendental sense gratification of the
Supreme Lord. Some of the jivas, however, wanted to lord it over material nature in imitation of the
lordship of the Personality of Godhead. Regarding when and why such propensities overcame the pure
living entities, it can only be explained that the jiva-tattvas have infinitesimal independence and that due
to misuse of this independence some of the living entities have become implicated in the conditions of
cosmic creation and are therefore called nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls.
The expansions of Vedic wisdom also give the nitya-baddhas, the conditioned living entities, a chance to
improve, and those who take advantage of such transcendental knowledge gradually regain their lost
consciousness of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord. The demigods are amongst the
conditioned souls who have developed this pure consciousness of service to the Lord but who at the same
time continue to desire to lord it over the material energy. Such mixed consciousness puts a conditioned
soul in the position of managing the affairs of this creation. The demigods are entrusted leaders of the
conditioned souls. As some of the old prisoners in government jails are entrusted with some responsible
work of prison management, so the demigods are improved conditioned souls acting as representatives of
the Lord in the material creation. Such demigods are devotees of the Lord in the material world, and when
completely free from all material desire to lord it over the material energy they become pure devotees and
have no desire but to serve the Lord. Therefore any living entity who desires a position in the material
world may desire so in the service of the Lord and may seek power and intelligence from the Lord, as
exemplified by the demigods in this particular verse. One cannot do anything unless he is enlightened and
empowered by the Lord. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca. All
recollections, knowledge, etc., as well as all forgetfulness, are engineered by the Lord, who is sitting
within the heart of everyone. The intelligent man seeks the help of the Lord, and the Lord helps the
sincere devotees engaged in His multifarious services.
The demigods are entrusted by the Lord to create different species of living entities according to their
past deeds. They are herein asking the favor of the Lord for the intelligence and power to carry out their
task. Similarly, any conditioned soul may also engage in the service of the Lord under the guidance of an
expert spiritual master and thus gradually become freed from the entanglement of material existence. The
spiritual master is the manifested representative of the Lord, and anyone who puts himself under the
guidance of a spiritual master and acts accordingly is said to be acting in terms of buddhi-yoga, as
explained in Bhagavad-gita (2.41):
vyavasayatmika buddhir
ekeha kuru-nandana
bahu-sakha hy anantas ca
buddhayo 'vyavasayinam
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Fifth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Vidura's Talks with Maitreya."
