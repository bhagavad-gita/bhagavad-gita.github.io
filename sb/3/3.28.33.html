<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore I do not find a greater person than he who has no interest outside of Mine and who therefore
engages and dedicates all his activities and all his life--everything--unto Me without cessation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word sama-darsanat means that he no longer has any separate interest; the devotee's
interest and the Supreme Personality of Godhead's interest are one. For example, Lord Caitanya, in the
role of a devotee, also preached the same philosophy. He preached that Krsna is the worshipful Lord, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that the interest of His pure devotees is the same as His own.
Sometimes Mayavadi philosophers, due to a poor fund of knowledge, define the word sama-darsanat to
mean that a devotee should see himself as one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is
foolishness. When one thinks himself one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question
of serving Him. When there is service, there must be a master. Three things must be present for there to
be service: the master, the servant and the service. Here it is clearly stated that he who has dedicated his
life, all his activities, his mind and his soul--everything--for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, is
considered to be the greatest person.
The word akartuh means "without any sense of proprietorship." Everyone wants to act as the proprietor
of his actions so that he can enjoy the result. A devotee, however, has no such desire; he acts because the
Personality of Godhead wants him to act in a particular way. He has no personal motive. When Lord
Caitanya preached Krsna consciousness, it was not with the purpose that people would call Him Krsna,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rather, He preached that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of
Godhead and should be worshiped as such. A devotee who is a most confidential servant of the Lord
never does anything for his personal account, but does everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Lord. It is clearly stated, therefore, mayi sannyasta-karmanah: the devotee works, but he works for the
Supreme. It is also stated, mayy arpitatmanah: "He gives his mind unto Me." These are the qualifications
of a devotee, who, according to this verse, is accepted as the highest of all human beings.
