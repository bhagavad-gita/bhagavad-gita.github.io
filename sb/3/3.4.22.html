There in Badarikasrama the Personality of Godhead, in His incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana,
has been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all amiable living entities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Badarikasrama in the Himalayas, the abode of the Nara-Narayana sages, is a great place of pilgrimage for
the Hindus. Even up to the present, hundreds and thousands of pious Hindus go to pay respects to the
incarnation of Godhead Nara-Narayana. It appears that even five thousand years ago this holy place was
being visited by such a holy being as Uddhava, and even at that time the place was known to be very, very
old. This particular pilgrimage site is very difficult to visit for ordinary men because of its difficult
situation in the Himalayas in a place which is covered by ice almost all year. A few months during the
summer season people can visit this place at great personal inconvenience. There are four dhamas, or
kingdoms of God, which represent the planets of the spiritual sky, which consists of the brahmajyoti and
the Vaikunthas. These are Badarikasrama, Ramesvara, Jagannatha Puri and Dvaraka. Faithful Hindus still
visit all these holy places for perfection of spiritual realization, following in the footsteps of devotees like
Uddhava.
