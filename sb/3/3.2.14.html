<h2>Translation</h2>
The damsels of Vraja, after pastimes of laughter, humor and exchanges of glances, were anguished when
Krsna left them. They used to follow Him with their eyes, and thus they sat down with stunned
intelligence and could not finish their household duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In His boyhood at Vrndavana, Lord Krsna was notorious as a teasing friend in transcendental love to all
the girls His age. His love for them was so intense that there is no comparison to that ecstasy, and the
damsels of Vraja were so much attached to Him that their affection excelled that of the great demigods
like Brahma and Siva. Lord Krsna finally admitted His defeat before the transcendental affection of the
gopis and declared that He was unable to repay them for their unalloyed affection. Although the gopis
were seemingly anguished by the Lord's teasing behavior, when Krsna would leave them they could not
tolerate the separation and used to follow Him with their eyes and minds. They were so stunned by the
situation that they could not finish their household duties. No one could excel Him even in the dealing of
love exchanged between boys and girls. It is said in the revealed scriptures that Lord Krsna personally
never goes beyond the boundary of Vrndavana. He remains there eternally because of the transcendental
love of the inhabitants. Thus even though He is not visible at present, He is not away from Vrndavana for
a moment.
