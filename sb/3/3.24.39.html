<h2>Purport</h2>
People are very anxious to understand the Absolute Truth in various ways, especially by experiencing
the brahmajyoti, or Brahman effulgence, by meditation and by mental speculation. But Kapiladeva uses
the word mam to emphasize that the Personality of Godhead is the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth.
In Bhagavad-gita the Personality of Godhead always says mam, "unto Me," but the rascals misinterpret the
clear meaning. Mam is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one can see the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as He appears in different incarnations and understand that He has not assumed a material body
but is present in His own eternal, spiritual form, then one can understand the nature of the Personality of
Godhead. Since the less intelligent cannot understand this point, it is stressed everywhere again and again.
Simply by seeing the form of the Lord as He presents Himself by His own internal potency as Krsna or
Rama or Kapila, one can directly see the brahmajyoti, because the brahmajyoti is no more than the
effulgence of His bodily luster. Since the sunshine is the luster of the sun planet, by seeing the sun one
automatically sees the sunshine; similarly, by seeing the Supreme personality of Godhead one
simultaneously sees and experiences the Paramatma feature as well as the impersonal Brahman feature of
the Supreme.
The Bhagavatam has already enunciated that the Absolute Truth is present in three features--in the
beginning as the impersonal Brahman, in the next stage as the Paramatma in everyone's heart, and, at last,
as the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
who sees the Supreme Person can automatically realize the other features, namely the Paramatma and
Brahman features of the Lord. The words used here are visoko 'bhayam rcchasi. Simply by seeing the
personality of Godhead one realizes everything, and the result is that one becomes situated on the
platform where there is no lamentation and no fear. This can be attained simply by devotional service to
the Personality of Godhead.
