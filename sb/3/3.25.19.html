<h2>Text</h2>
na yujyamanaya bhaktya
bhagavaty akhilatmani
sadrso 'sti sivah pantha
yoginam brahma-siddhaye
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; yujyamanaya--being performed; bhaktya--devotional service; bhagavati--towards the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; akhila-atmani--the Supersoul; sadrsah--like; asti--there is; sivah--auspicious;
panthah--path; yoginam--of the yogis; brahma-siddhaye--for perfection in self-realization.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Perfection in self-realization cannot be attained by any kind of yogi unless he engages in devotional
service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for that is the only auspicious path.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
That knowledge and renunciation are never perfect unless joined by devotional service is explicitly
explained here. Na yujyamanaya means "without being dovetailed." When there is devotional service,
then the question is where to offer that service. Devotional service is to be offered to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul of everything, for that is the only reliable path of selfrealization,
or Brahman realization. The word brahma-siddhaye means to understand oneself to be
different from matter, to understand oneself to be Brahman. The Vedic words are aham brahmasmi.
Brahma-siddhi means that one should know that he is not matter; he is pure soul. There are different
kinds of yogis, but every yogi is supposed to engage in self-realization, or Brahman realization. It is clearly
stated here that unless one is fully engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead one cannot have easy approach to the path of brahma-siddhi.
In the beginning of the Second Chapter of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that when one engages
himself in the devotional service of Vasudeva, spiritual knowledge and renunciation of the material world
automatically become manifest. Thus a devotee does not have to try separately for renunciation or
knowledge. Devotional service itself is so powerful that by one's service attitude, everything is revealed. It
is stated here, sivah panthah: this is the only auspicious path for self-realization. The path of devotional
service is the most confidential means for attaining Brahman realization. That perfection in Brahman
realization is attained through the auspicious path of devotional service indicates that the so-called
Brahman realization, or realization of the brahmajyoti effulgence, is not brahma-siddhi. Beyond that
brahmajyoti there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Upanisads a devotee prays to the Lord to
kindly put aside the effulgence, brahmajyoti, so that the devotee may see within the brahmajyoti the
actual, eternal form of the Lord. Unless one attains realization of the transcendental form of the Lord,
there is no question of bhakti. Bhakti necessitates the existence of the recipient of devotional service and
the devotee who renders devotional service. Brahma-siddhi through devotional service is realization of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. The understanding of the effulgent rays of the body of the Supreme
Godhead is not the perfect stage of brahma-siddhi, or Brahman realization. Nor is the realization of the
Paramatma feature of the Supreme Person perfect, for Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
akhilatma--He is the Supersoul. One who realizes the Supreme Personality realizes the other features,
namely the Paramatma feature and the Brahman feature, and that total realization is brahma-siddhi.
