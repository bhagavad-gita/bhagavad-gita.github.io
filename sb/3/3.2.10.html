<h2>Translation</h2>
Under no circumstances can the words of persons bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord deviate
the intelligence of those who are completely surrendered souls.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to all the evidences of the Vedas. He is
accepted by all acaryas, including Sripada Sankaracarya. But when He was present in the world, different
classes of men accepted Him differently, and therefore their calculations of the Lord were also different.
Generally, persons who had faith in the revealed scriptures accepted the Lord as He is, and all of them
merged into great bereavement when the Lord disappeared from the world. In the First Canto we have
already discussed the lamentation of Arjuna and Yudhisthira, to whom the disappearance of Lord Krsna
was almost intolerable up to the end of their lives.
The Yadavas were only partially cognizant of the Lord, but they are also glorious because they had the
opportunity to associate with the Lord, who acted as the head of their family, and they also rendered the
Lord intimate service. The Yadavas and other devotees of the Lord are different from those who wrongly
calculated Him to be an ordinary human personality. Such persons are certainly bewildered by the illusory
energy. They are hellish and are envious of the Supreme Lord. The illusory energy acts very powerfully on
them because in spite of their elevated mundane education, such persons are faithless and are infected by
the mentality of atheism. They are always very eager to establish that Lord Krsna was an ordinary man
who was killed by a hunter due to His many impious acts in plotting to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra and
Jarasandha, the demoniac kings of the earth. Such persons have no faith in the statement of the Bhagavadgita
that the Lord is unaffected by the reactions of work: na mam karmani limpanti. According to the
atheistic point of view, Lord Krsna's family, the Yadu dynasty, was vanquished due to being cursed by the
brahmanas for the sins committed by Krsna in killing the sons of Dhrtarastra, etc. All these blasphemies
do not touch the heart of the devotees of the Lord because they know perfectly well what is what. Their
intelligence regarding the Lord is never disturbed. But those who are disturbed by the statements of the
asuras are also condemned. That is what Uddhava meant in this verse.
