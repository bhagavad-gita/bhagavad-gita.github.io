<h2>Translation</h2>
My Lord, even the learned sages become disturbed in their intelligence when they see that Your
Greatness engages in fruitive work although You are free from all desires, that You take birth although
You are unborn, that You flee out of fear of the enemy and take shelter in a fort although You are the
controller of invincible time, and that You enjoy householder life surrounded by many women although
You enjoy in Your Self.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Pure devotees of the Lord are not very much concerned with philosophical speculation in regard to
transcendental knowledge of the Lord. Nor is it possible to acquire complete knowledge of the Lord.
Whatever little knowledge they have about the Lord is sufficient for them because devotees are simply
satisfied in hearing and chanting about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. This gives them all
transcendental bliss. But some of the pastimes of the Lord appear contradictory, even to such pure
devotees, and thus Uddhava asked the Lord about some of the contradictory incidents in His pastimes.
The Lord is described as having nothing to do personally, and it is actually so because even in the creation
and sustenance of the material world, the Lord has nothing to do. It seems contradictory, then, to hear
that the Lord personally lifts the Govardhana Hill for the protection of His unalloyed devotees. The Lord
is the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead appearing like a man, but
Uddhava had doubts whether He could have so many transcendental activities.
There is no difference between the Personality of Godhead and the impersonal Brahman. How then can
the Lord have so many things to do, whereas the impersonal Brahman is stated to have nothing to do
either materially or spiritually? If the Lord is ever unborn, how then is He born as the son of Vasudeva
and Devaki? He is fearful even to kala, the supreme fear, and yet the Lord is afraid of fighting Jarasandha
and takes shelter in a fort. Mow can one who is full in Himself take pleasure in the association of many
women? How can He take wives and, just like a householder, take pleasure in the association of family
members, children, relatives and parents? All these apparently contradictory happenings bewilder even
the greatest learned scholars, who, thus bewildered, cannot understand whether inactivity is a fact or
whether His activities are only imitations.
The solution is that the Lord has nothing to do with anything mundane. All His activities are
transcendental. This cannot be understood by the mundane speculators. For the mundane speculators
there is certainly a kind of bewilderment, but for the transcendental devotees there is nothing astonishing
in this. The Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth is certainly the negation of all mundane activities,
but the Parabrahman conception is full with transcendental activities. One who knows the distinctions
between the conception of Brahman and the conception of Supreme Brahman is certainly the real
transcendentalist. There is no bewilderment for such transcendentalists. The Lord Himself also declares in
Bhagavad-gita (10.2), "Even the great sages and demigods can know hardly anything about My activities
and transcendental potencies." The right explanation of the Lord's activities is given by Grandfather
Bhismadeva (Bhag. 1.9.16) as follows:
na hy asya karhicid rajan
puman veda vidhitsitam
yad-vijijnasaya yukta
muhyanti kavayo 'pi hi
