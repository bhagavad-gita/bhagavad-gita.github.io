<h2>Translation</h2>
The demigods addressed the Lord: All obeisances unto You! You are the enjoyer of all sacrifices, and
You have assumed the form of a boar, in pure goodness, for the purpose of maintaining the world.
Fortunately for us, this demon, who was a torment to the worlds, has been slain by You, and we too, O
Lord, are now at ease, in devotion to Your lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world consists of three modes--goodness, passion and ignorance--but the spiritual world is
pure goodness. It is said here that the form of the Lord is pure goodness, which means that it is not
material. In the material world there is no pure goodness. In the Bhagavatam the stage of pure goodness is
called sattvam visuddham. Visuddham means "pure." In pure goodness there is no contamination by the
two inferior qualities, namely passion and ignorance. The form of the boar, therefore, in which the Lord
appeared, is nothing of the material world. There are many other forms of the Lord, but none of them
belong to the material qualities. Such forms are nondifferent from the Visnu form, and Visnu is the
enjoyer of all sacrifices.
The sacrifices which are recommended in the Vedas are meant to please the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In ignorance only, people try to satisfy many other agents, but the real purpose of life is to
satisfy the Supreme Lord, Visnu. All sacrifices are meant to please the Supreme Lord. The living entities
who know this perfectly well are called demigods, godly or almost God. Since the living entity is part and
parcel of the Supreme Lord, it is his duty to serve the Lord and please Him. The demigods are all attached
to the Personality of Godhead, and for their pleasure the demon, who was a source of trouble to the
world, was killed. Purified life is meant to please the Lord, and all sacrifices performed in purified life are
called Krsna consciousness. This Krsna consciousness is developed by devotional service, as clearly
mentioned here.
