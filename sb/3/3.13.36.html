<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, Your tongue is a plate of sacrifice, Your nostril is another plate of sacrifice, in Your belly is the
eating plate of sacrifice, and another plate of sacrifice is the holes of Your ears. In Your mouth is the
Brahma plate of sacrifice, Your throat is the plate of sacrifice known as soma, and whatever You chew is
known as agni-hotra.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The veda-vadis say that there is nothing more than the Vedas and the performances of sacrifice
mentioned in the Vedas. They have recently made a rule in their group to formally observe daily sacrifice;
they simply ignite a small fire and offer something whimsically, but they do not strictly follow the
sacrificial rules and regulations mentioned in the Vedas. It is understood that by regulation there are
different plates of sacrifice required, such as srak, sruva, barhis, catur-hotra, ida, camasa, prasitra, graha
and agni-hotra. One cannot achieve the results of sacrifice unless one observes the strict regulations. In
this age there is practically no facility for performing sacrifices in strict discipline. Therefore, in this age of
Kali there is a stricture regarding such sacrifices: it is explicitly directed that one should perform
sankirtana-yajna and nothing more. The incarnation of the Supreme Lord is Yajnesvara, and unless one
has respect for the incarnation of the Lord, he cannot perfectly perform sacrifice. In other words, taking
shelter of the Lord and rendering service unto Him is the factual performance of all sacrifices, as
explained herein. Different plates of sacrifice correspond to the different parts of the body of the Lord's
incarnation. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Eleventh Canto, it is explicitly directed that one should perform
sankirtana-yajna to please the Lord's incarnation as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. This should be rigidly
followed in order to achieve the result of yajna performance.
