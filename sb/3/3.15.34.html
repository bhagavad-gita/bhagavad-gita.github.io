<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; vam--unto these two; amusya--of Him; paramasya--the Supreme; vikuntha-bhartuh--the
Lord of Vaikuntha; kartum--to bestow; prakrstam--benefit; iha--in the matter of this offense; dhimahi--let
us consider; manda-dhibhyam--those whose intelligence is not very nice; lokan--to the material world;
itah--from this place (Vaikuntha); vrajatam--go; antara-bhava--duality; drstya--on account of seeing;
papiyasah--sinful; trayah--three; ime--these; ripavah--enemies; asya--of a living entity; yatra--where.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore let us consider how these two contaminated persons should be punished. The punishment
should be apt, for thus benefit can eventually be bestowed upon them. Since they find duality in the
existence of Vaikuntha life, they are contaminated and should be removed from this place to the material
world, where the living entities have three kinds of enemies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The reason why pure souls come into the existential circumstances of the material world, which is
considered to be the criminal department of the Supreme Lord, is stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh
Chapter, verse 27. It is stated that as long as a living entity is pure, he is in complete harmony with the
desires of the Supreme Lord, but as soon as he becomes impure he is in disharmony with the desires of
the Lord. By contamination he is forced to transfer to this material world, where the living entities have
three enemies, namely desire, anger and lust. These three enemies force the living entities to continue
material existence, and when one is free from them he is eligible to enter the kingdom of God. One should
not, therefore, be angry in the absence of an opportunity for sense gratification, and one should not be
lusty to acquire more than necessary. In this verse it is clearly stated that the two doormen should be sent
into the material world, where criminals are allowed to reside. Since the basic principles of criminality are
sense gratification, anger and unnecessary lust, persons conducted by these three enemies of the living
entity are never promoted to Vaikunthaloka. People should learn Bhagavad-gita and accept the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as the Lord of everything; they should practice satisfying the senses of the
Supreme Lord instead of trying to satisfy their own senses. Training in Krsna consciousness will help one
be promoted to Vaikuntha.
