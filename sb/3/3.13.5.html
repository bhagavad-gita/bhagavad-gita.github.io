<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: The Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna was pleased to place His lotus feet on
the lap of Vidura because Vidura was very meek and gentle. The sage Maitreya was very pleased with
Vidura's words, and, being influenced by his spirit, he attempted to speak.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word sahasra-sirsnah is very significant. One who has diverse energies and activities and a
wonderful brain is known as the sahasra-sirsnah. This qualification is applicable only to the personality of
Godhead, Sri Krsna, and no one else. The Personality of Godhead was pleased to dine sometimes with
Vidura at his home, and while resting He placed His lotus feet on the lap of Vidura. Maitreya was inspired
by the thought of Vidura's wonderful fortune. The hairs of his body stood on end, and he was pleased to
narrate the topics of the Personality of Godhead with great delight.
