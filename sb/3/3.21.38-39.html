<h2>Translation</h2>
The holy Lake Bindu-sarovara, flooded by the waters of the River Sarasvati, was resorted to by hosts of
eminent sages. Its holy water was not only auspicious but as sweet as nectar. It was called Bindu-sarovara
because drops of tears had fallen there from the eyes of the Lord, who was overwhelmed by extreme
compassion for the sage who had sought His protection.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama underwent austerities to gain the causeless mercy of the Lord, and when the Lord arrived there
He was so compassionate that in pleasure He shed tears, which became Bindu-sarovara. Bindu-sarovara,
therefore, is worshiped by great sages and learned scholars because, according to the philosophy of the
Absolute Truth, the Lord and the tears from His eyes are not different. Just as drops of perspiration which
fell from the toe of the Lord became the sacred Ganges, so teardrops from the transcendental eyes of the
Lord became Bindu-sarovara. Both are transcendental entities and are worshiped by great sages and
scholars. The water of Bindu-sarovara is described here as sivamrta jala. Siva means "curing." Anyone who
drinks the water of Bindu-sarovara is cured of all material diseases; similarly, anyone who takes his bath
in the Ganges also is relieved of all material diseases. These claims are accepted by great scholars and
authorities and are still being acted upon even in this fallen age of Kali.
