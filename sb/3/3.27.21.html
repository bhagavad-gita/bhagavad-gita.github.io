TRANSLATION
The mode of goodness, which is the clear, sober status of understanding the Personality of Godhead and
which is generally called vasudeva, or consciousness, becomes manifest in the mahat-tattva.
PURPORT
The vasudeva manifestation, or the status of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is
called pure goodness, or suddha-sattva. In the suddha-sattva status there is no infringement of the other
qualities, namely passion and ignorance. In the Vedic literature there is mention of the Lord's expansion
as the four Personalities of Godhead--Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. Here in the
reappearance of the mahat-tattva the four expansions of Godhead occur. He who is seated within as
Supersoul expands first as Vasudeva.
The vasudeva stage is free from infringement by material desires and is the status in which one can
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the objective which is described in the Bhagavad-gita
as adbhuta. This is another feature of the mahat-tattva. The vasudeva expansion is also called Krsna
consciousness, for it is free from all tinges of material passion and ignorance. This clear state of
understanding helps one to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The vasudeva status is also
explained in Bhagavad-gita as ksetra-jna, which refers to the knower of the field of activities as well as the
Superknower. The living being who has occupied a particular type of body knows that body, but the
Superknower, Vasudeva, knows not only a particular type of body but also the field of activities in all the
different varieties of bodies. In order to be situated in clear consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, one
must worship Vasudeva. Vasudeva is Krsna alone. When Krsna, or Visnu, is alone, without the
accompaniment of His internal energy, He is Vasudeva. When He is accompanied by His internal potency,
He is called Dvarakadhisa. To have clear consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, one has to worship
Vasudeva. It is also explained in Bhagavad-gita that after many, many births one surrenders to Vasudeva.
Such a great soul is very rare.
In order to get release from the false ego, one has to worship Sankarsana. Sankarsana is also worshiped
through Lord Siva; the snakes which cover the body of Lord Siva are representations of Sankarsana, and
Lord Siva is always absorbed in meditation upon Sankarsana. One who is actually a worshiper of Lord
Siva as a devotee of Sankarsana can be released from false, material ego. If one wants to get free from
mental disturbances, one has to worship Aniruddha. For this purpose, worship of the moon planet is also
recommended in the Vedic literature. Similarly, to be fixed in one's intelligence one has to worship
Pradyumna, who is reached through the worship of Brahma. These matters are explained in Vedic
literature.
