<h2>Text</h2>
jarayaty asu ya kosam
nigirnam analo yatha
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
jarayati--dissolves; asu--quickly; ya--which; kosam--the subtle body; nigirnam--things eaten; analah--
fire; yatha--as.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Bhakti, devotional service, dissolves the subtle body of the living entity without separate effort, just as
fire in the stomach digests all that we eat.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Bhakti is in a far higher position than mukti because a person's endeavor to get liberation from the
material encagement is automatically served in devotional service. The example is given here that the fire
in the stomach can digest whatever we eat. If the digestive power is sufficient, then whatever we can eat
will be digested by the fire in the stomach. Similarly, a devotee does not have to try separately to attain
liberation. That very service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of his liberation
because to engage oneself in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from material entanglement. Sri
Bilvamangala Thakura explained this position very nicely. He said, "If I have unflinching devotion unto
the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, then mukti, or liberation, serves me as my maidservant. Mukti, the
maidservant, is always ready to do whatever I ask."
For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor. Bhakti,
therefore, is far better then mukti or the impersonalist position. The impersonalists undergo severe
penances and austerities to attain mukti, but the bhakta, simply by engaging himself in the bhakti process,
especially in chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare, immediately develops control over the tongue by engaging it in chanting, and accepting
the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Personality of Godhead. As soon as the tongue is controlled,
naturally all other senses are controlled automatically. Sense control is the perfection of the yoga
principle, and one's liberation begins immediately as soon as he engages himself in the service of the Lord.
It is confirmed by Kapiladeva that bhakti, or devotional service, is gariyasi, more glorious than siddhi,
liberation.
