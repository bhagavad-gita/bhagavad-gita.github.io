param pradhanam purusam mahantam
kalam kavim tri-vrtam loka-palam
atmanubhutyanugata-prapancam
svacchanda-saktim kapilam prapadye
SYNONYMS
param--transcendental; pradhanam--supreme; purusam--person; mahantam--who is the origin of the
material world; kalam--who is time; kavim--fully cognizant; tri-vrtam--three modes of material nature;
loka-palam--who is the maintainer of all the universes; atma--in Himself; anubhutya--by internal potency;
anugata--dissolved; prapancam--whose material manifestations; sva-chanda--independently; saktim--who
is powerful; kapilam--to Lord Kapila; prapadye--I surrender.
TRANSLATION
I surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, descended in the form of Kapila, who is
independently powerful and transcendental, who is the Supreme Person and the Lord of the sum total of
matter and the element of time, who is the fully cognizant maintainer of all the universes under the three
modes of material nature, and who absorbs the material manifestations after their dissolution.
PURPORT
The six opulences--wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation--are indicated here by
Kardama Muni, who addresses Kapila Muni, his son, as param. The word param is used in the beginning
of Srimad-Bhagavatam, in the phrase param satyam, to refer to the summum bonum, or the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. param is explained further by the next word, pradhanam, which means the chief,
the origin, the source of everything--sarva-karana-karanam--the cause of all causes. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is not formless; He is purusam, or the enjoyer, the original person. He is the time
element and is all-cognizant. He knows everything--past, present and future--as confirmed in Bhagavadgita.
The Lord says, "I know everything--present, past and future--in every corner of the universe." The
material world, which is moving under the spell of the three modes of nature, is also a manifestation of
His energy. parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate: everything that we see is an interaction of His energies
(Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8). parasya brahmanah saktis tathedam akhilam jagat. This is the version of the
Visnu purana. We can understand that whatever we see is an interaction of the three modes of material
nature, but actually it is all an interaction of the Lord's energy. Loka-palam: He is actually the maintainer
of all living entities. Nityo nityanam: He is the chief of all living entities; He is one, but He maintains
many, many living entities. God maintains all other living entities, but no one can maintain God. That is
His svacchanda-sakti; He is not dependent on others. Someone may call himself independent, but he is
still dependent on someone higher. The Personality of Godhead, however, is absolute; there is no one
higher than or equal to Him.
Kapila Muni appeared as the son of Kardama Muni, but because Kapila is an incarnation of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Kardama Muni offered respectful obeisances unto Him with full surrender.
Another word in this verse is very important: atmanubhutyanugata-prapancam. The Lord descends either
as Kapila or Rama, Nrsimha or Varaha, and whatever forms He assumes in the material world are all
manifestations of His own personal internal energy. They are never forms of the material energy. The
ordinary living entities who are manifested in this material world have bodies created by the material
energy, but when Krsna or any one of His expansions or parts of the expansions descends on this material
world, although He appears to have a material body, His body is not material. He always has a
transcendental body. But fools and rascals, who are called mudhas, consider Him one of them, and
therefore they deride Him. They refuse to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because
they cannot understand Him. In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says, avajananti mam mudhah: "Those who are
rascals and fools deride Me." When God descends in a form, this does not mean that He assumes His form
with the help of the material energy. He manifests His spiritual form as He exists in His spiritual kingdom.
