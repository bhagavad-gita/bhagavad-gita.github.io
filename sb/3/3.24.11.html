<h2>Text</h2>
sabhajayan visuddhena
cetasa tac-cikirsitam
prahrsyamanair asubhih
kardamam cedam abhyadhat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sabhajayan--worshiping; visuddhena--pure; cetasa--with a heart; tat--of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; cikirsitam--the intended activities; prahrsyamanaih--gladdened; asubhih--with senses;
kardamam--to Kardama Muni; ca--and Devahuti; idam--this; abhyadhat--spoke.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After worshiping the Supreme Lord with gladdened senses and a pure heart for His intended activities as
an incarnation, Brahma spoke as follows to Kardama and Devahuti.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As explained in Bhagavad-gita, Fourth Chapter, anyone who understands the transcendental activities,
the appearance and the disappearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be considered
liberated. Brahma, therefore, is a liberated soul. Although he is in charge of this material world, he is not
exactly like the common living entity. Since he is liberated from the majority of the follies of the common
living entities, he was in knowledge of the appearance of the Supreme personality of Godhead, and he
therefore worshiped the Lord's activities, and with a glad heart he also praised Kardama Muni because the
Supreme personality of Godhead, as Kapila, had appeared as his son. One who can become the father of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly a great devotee. There is a verse spoken by a brahmana in
which he says that he does not know what the Vedas and what the puranas are, but while others might be
interested in the Vedas or puranas, he is interested in Nanda Maharaja, who appeared as the father of
Krsna. The brahmana wanted to worship Nanda Maharaja because the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
as a child, crawled in the yard of his house. These are some of the good sentiments of devotees. If a
recognized devotee brings forth the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, how he should be
praised! Brahma, therefore, not only worshiped the incarnation of Godhead Kapila but also praised His
so-called father, Kardama Muni.
