<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Suta Gosvami continued: My dear brahmana, Ksatta [Vidura] the great devotee of the Lord achieved
transcendental bliss by hearing the narration of the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from
the authoritative source of the sage Kausarava [Maitreya], and he was very pleased.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
If anyone wants to derive transcendental pleasure by hearing the pastimes of the Lord, he must hear
from the authoritative source, as explained here. Maitreya heard the narration from his bona fide spiritual
master, and Vidura also heard from Maitreya. One becomes an authority simply by presenting whatever
he has heard from his spiritual master, and one who does not accept a bona fide spiritual master cannot be
an authority. This is clearly explained here. If one wants to have transcendental pleasure, he must find a
person with authority. It is also stated in the Bhagavatam that simply by hearing from an authoritative
source, with the ear and the heart, one can relish the pastimes of the Lord, otherwise it is not possible.
Sanatana Gosvami, therefore, has especially warned that one should not hear anything about the
personality of the Lord from the lips of a nondevotee. Nondevotees are considered to be like serpents; as
milk is poisoned by a serpent's touch, so, although the narration of the pastimes of the Lord is as pure as
milk, when administered by serpentlike nondevotees it becomes poisonous. Not only does it have no
effect in transcendental pleasure, but it is dangerous also. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has warned that no
description of the pastimes of the Lord should be heard from the Mayavada, or impersonalist, school. He
has clearly said, mayavadi-bhasya sunile haya sarva nasa: if anyone hears the Mayavadis' interpretation of
the pastimes of the Lord, or their interpretation of Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam or any other Vedic
literature, then he is doomed. Once one is associated with impersonalists, he can never understand the
personal feature of the Lord and His transcendental pastimes.
Suta Gosvami was speaking to the sages headed by Saunaka, and therefore he addressed them in this
verse as dvija, twice-born. The sages assembled in Naimisaranya hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam from Suta
Gosvami were all brahmanas, but to acquire the qualifications of a brahmana is not everything. Merely to
be twice-born is not perfection. Perfection is attained when one hears the pastimes and activities of the
Lord from a bona fide source.
