<h2>Text</h2>
samahitam te hrdayam
yatreman parivatsaran
sa tvam brahman nrpa-vadhuh
kamam asu bhajisyati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
samahitam--has been fixed; te--your; hrdayam--heart; yatra--on whom; iman--for all these;
parivatsaran--years; sa--she; tvam--you; brahman--O brahmana; nrpa-vadhuh--the princess; kamam--as
you desire; asu--very soon; bhajisyati--will serve.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
That princess, O holy sage, will be just the type you have been thinking of in your heart for all these
long years. She will soon be yours and will serve you to your heart's content.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord awards all benedictions according to the heart's desire of a devotee, so the Lord informed
Kardama Muni, "The girl who is coming to be married with you is a princess, the daughter of Emperor
Svayambhuva, and so just suitable for your purpose." Only by God's grace can one get a nice wife just as
he desires. Similarly, it is only by God's grace that a girl gets a husband suitable to her heart. Thus it is
said that if we pray to the Supreme Lord in every transaction of our material existence, everything will be
done very nicely and just suitable to our heart's desire. In other words, in all circumstances we must take
shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depend completely on His decision. Man proposes,
God disposes. The fulfillment of desires, therefore, should be entrusted to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; that is the nicest solution. Kardama Muni desired only a wife, but because he was a devotee of
the Lord, the Lord selected a wife for him who was the Emperor's daughter, a princess. Thus Kardama
Muni got a wife beyond his expectation. If we depend on the choice of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, we will receive benedictions in greater opulence than we desire.
It is also significantly noted here that Kardama Muni was a brahmana, whereas Emperor Svayambhuva
was a ksatriya. Therefore, intercaste marriage was current even in those days. The system was that a
brahmana could marry the daughter of a ksatriya, but a ksatriya could not marry the daughter of a
brahmana. We have evidences from the history of the Vedic age that Sukracarya offered his daughter to
Maharaja Yayati, but the King had to refuse to marry the daughter of a brahmana; only with the special
permission of the brahmana could they marry. Intercaste marriage, therefore, was not prohibited in the
olden days, many millions of years ago, but there was a regular system of social behavior.
