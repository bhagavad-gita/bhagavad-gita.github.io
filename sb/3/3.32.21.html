<h2>Text</h2>
vanam pravrajite patyav
apatya-virahatura
jnata-tattvapy abhun naste
vatse gaur iva vatsala
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vanam--to the forest; pravrajite patyau--when her husband left home; apatya-viraha--by separation from
her son; atura--very sorry; jnata-tattva--knowing the truth; api--although; abhut--she became; naste vatse--
when her calf is lost; gauh--a cow; iva--like; vatsala--affectionate.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Devahuti's husband had already left home and accepted the renounced order of life, and then her only
son, Kapila, left home. Although she knew all the truths of life and death, and although her heart was
cleansed of all dirt, she was very aggrieved at the loss of her son, just as a cow is affected when her calf
dies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A woman whose husband is away from home or has taken the renounced order of life should not be
very sorry, because she still has the presence of her husband's representative, her son. It is said in the
Vedic scriptures, atmaiva putro jayate: the husband's body is represented by the son. Strictly speaking, a
woman is never widowed if she has a grown son. Devahuti was not very much affected while Kapila Muni
was there, but upon His departure she was very afflicted. She grieved not because of her worldly
relationship with Kardama Muni but because of her sincere love for the Personality of Godhead.
The example given here is that Devahuti became just like a cow who has lost her calf. A cow bereft of
her calf cries day and night. Similarly, Devahuti was aggrieved, and she always cried and requested her
friends and relatives, "Please bring my son home so that I may live. Otherwise, I shall die." This intense
affection for the Supreme personality of Godhead, although manifested as affection for one's son, is
spiritually beneficial. Attachment for a material son obliges one to remain in material existence, but the
same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Lord, brings one elevation to the spiritual world in the
association of the Lord.
Every woman can qualify herself as much as Devahuti and then can also have the Supreme Godhead as
her son. If the Supreme personality of Godhead can appear as the son of Devahuti, He can also appear as
the son of any other woman, provided that woman is qualified. If one gets the Supreme Lord as a son, one
can have the benefit of bringing up a nice son in this world and at the same time get promotion to the
spiritual world to become the face-to-face associate of the Personality of Godhead.
