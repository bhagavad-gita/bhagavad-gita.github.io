<h2>Text</h2>
snatam krta-sirah-snanam
sarvabharana-bhusitam
niska-grivam valayinam
kujat-kancana-nupuram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
snatam--bathed; krta-sirah--including the head; snanam--bathing; sarva--all over; abharana--with
ornaments; bhusitam--decorated; niska--a gold necklace with a locket; grivam--on the neck; valayinam--
with bangles; kujat--tinkling; kancana--made of gold; nupuram--ankle bells.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Her entire body, including her head, was completely bathed, and she was decorated all over with
ornaments. She wore a special necklace with a locket. There were bangles on her wrists and tinkling
anklets of gold about her ankles.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word krta-sirah-snanam appears here. According to the smrti-sastra's directions for daily duties,
ladies are allowed to bathe daily up to the neck. The hair on the head does not necessarily have to be
washed daily because the mass of wet hair may cause a cold. For ladies, therefore, taking a bath up to the
neck is ordinarily prescribed, and they take a full bath only on certain occasions. On this occasion
Devahuti took a full bath and washed her hair very nicely. When a lady takes an ordinary bath it is called
mala-snana, and when she takes a full bath, including the head, it is called sirah-snana. At this time she
needs sufficient oil to smear on her head. That is the direction of the commentators of smrti-sastra.
