<h2>Text</h2>
sa eva bhagavan adya
helanam na ganayya nah
grhesu jato gramyanam
yah svanam paksa-posanah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah eva--that very same; bhagavan--Supreme Personality of Godhead; adya--today; helanam--negligence;
na--not; ganayya--considering high and low; nah--our; grhesu--in the houses; jatah--appeared;
gramyanam--of ordinary householders; yah--He who; svanam--of His own devotees; paksa-posanah--who
supports the party.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Not considering the negligence of ordinary householders like us, that very same Supreme Personality of
Godhead appears in our homes just to support His devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devotees are so affectionate toward the Personality of Godhead that although He does not appear before
those who practice yoga in a secluded place even for many, many births, He agrees to appear in a
householder's home where devotees engage in devotional service without material yoga practice. In other
words, devotional service to the Lord is so easy that even a householder can see the Supreme Personality
of Godhead as one of the members of his household, as his son, as Kardama Muni experienced. He was a
householder, although a yogi, but he had the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila
Muni as his son.
Devotional service is such a powerful transcendental method that it surpasses all other methods of
transcendental realization. The Lord says, therefore, that He lives neither in Vaikuntha nor in the heart of
a yogi, but He lives where His pure devotees are always chanting and glorifying Him. The Supreme
Personality of Godhead is known as bhakta-vatsala. He is never described as jnani-vatsala or yogi-vatsala.
He is always described as bhakta-vatsala because He is more inclined toward His devotees than toward
other transcendentalists. In Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that only a devotee can understand Him as He
is. Bhaktya mam abhijanati: "One can understand Me only by devotional service, not otherwise." That
understanding alone is real because although jnanis, mental speculators, can realize only the effulgence,
or the bodily luster, of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and yogis can realize only the partial
representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a bhakta not only realizes Him as He is but also
associates with the Personality of Godhead face to face.
