<h2>Text</h2>
tad vilokyabja-sambhuto
vayuna yad-adhisthitah
padmam ambhas ca tat-kalakrta-
viryena kampitam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat vilokya--looking into that; abja-sambhutah--whose source of birth was a lotus; vayuna--by the air;
yat--that; adhisthitah--on which he was situated; padmam--lotus; ambhah--water; ca--also; tat-kala-krta--
which was effected by eternal time; viryena--by its inherent force; kampitam--trembling.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter Brahma saw that both the lotus on which he was situated and the water on which the lotus
was growing were trembling due to a strong, violent wind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world is called illusory because it is a place of forgetfulness of the transcendental service of
the Lord. Thus one engaged in the the Lord's devotional service in the material world may sometimes be
very much disturbed by awkward circumstances. There is a declaration of war between the two parties,
the illusory energy and the devotee, and sometimes the weak devotees fall victim to the onslaught of the
powerful illusory energy. Lord Brahma, however, was sufficiently strong, by the causeless mercy of the
Lord, and he could not be victimized by the material energy, although it gave him cause for anxiety when
it managed to totter the existence of his position.
