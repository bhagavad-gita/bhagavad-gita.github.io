<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage could see that Devahuti had washed herself clean and was shining forth as though no longer
his former wife. She had regained her own original beauty as the daughter of a prince. Dressed in
excellent robes, her charming breasts duly girded, she was waited upon by a thousand Gandharva girls. O
destroyer of the enemy, his fondness for her grew, and he placed her on the aerial mansion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Before her marriage, when Devahuti was brought by her parents before the sage Kardama, she was the
perfectly beautiful princess, and Kardama Muni remembered her former beauty. But after her marriage,
when she was engaged in the service of Kardama Muni, she neglected to care for her body like a princess,
since there was no means for such care; her husband was living in a cottage, and since she was always
engaged in serving him, her royal beauty disappeared, and she became just like an ordinary maidservant.
Now, after being bathed by the Gandharva girls by the order of Kardama Muni's yogic power, she regained
her beauty, and Kardama Muni felt attracted to the beauty she had shown before the marriage. The real
beauty of a young woman is her breasts. When Kardama Muni saw the breasts of his wife so nicely
decorated, increasing her beauty many times, he was attracted, even though he was a great sage. Sripada
Sankaracarya has therefore warned the transcendentalists that one who is after transcendental realization
should not be attracted by the raised breasts of a woman because they are nothing but an interaction of fat
and blood within the body.
