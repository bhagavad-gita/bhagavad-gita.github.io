<h2>Text</h2>
yac chraddhaya srutavatya ca bhaktya

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--that which; sraddhaya--by eagerness; srutavatya--simply by hearing; ca--also; bhaktya--in devotion;
sammrjyamane--being cleansed; hrdaye--in the heart; avadhaya--meditation; jnanena--by knowledge;
vairagya--detachment; balena--by the strength of; dhirah--the pacified; vrajema--must go to; tat--that; te--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by hearing about Your lotus feet with eagerness and devotion and by meditating upon them
within the heart, one at once becomes enlightened with knowledge, and on the strength of detachment
one becomes pacified. We must therefore take shelter of the sanctuary of Your lotus feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The miracles of meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord with eagerness and devotion are so great that no
other process can compare to it. The minds of materialistic persons are so disturbed that it is almost
impossible for them to search after the Supreme Truth by personal regulative endeavors. But even such
materialistic men, with a little eagerness for hearing about the transcendental name, fame, qualities, etc.,
can surpass all other methods of attaining knowledge and detachment. The conditioned soul is attached to
the bodily conception of the self, and therefore he is in ignorance. Culture of self-knowledge can bring
about detachment from material affection, and without such detachment there is no meaning to
knowledge. The most stubborn attachment for material enjoyment is sex life. One who is attached to sex
life is to be understood as devoid of knowledge. Knowledge must be followed by detachment. That is the
way of self-realization. These two essentials for self-realization--knowledge and detachment--become
manifest very quickly if one performs devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord. The word dhira is
very significant in this connection. A person who is not disturbed even in the presence of cause of
disturbance is called dhira. Sri Yamunacarya says, "Since my heart has been overwhelmed by the
devotional service of Lord Krsna, I cannot even think of sex life, and if thoughts of sex come upon me I at
once feel disgust." A devotee of the Lord becomes an elevated dhira by the simple process of meditating in
eagerness on the lotus feet of the Lord.
Devotional service entails being initiated by a bona fide spiritual master and following his instruction in
regard to hearing about the Lord. Such a bona fide spiritual master is accepted by regularly hearing from
him about the Lord. The improvement in knowledge and detachment can be perceived by devotees as an
actual experience. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu strongly recommended this process of hearing from a
bona fide devotee, and by following this process one can achieve the highest result, conquering all other
methods.
