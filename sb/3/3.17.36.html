tayor asurayor adya
tejasa yamayor hi vah
aksiptam teja etarhi
bhagavams tad vidhitsati
SYNONYMS
tayoh--of them; asurayoh--of the two asuras; adya--today; tejasa--by the prowess; yamayoh--of the twins;
hi--certainly; vah--of all you demigods; aksiptam--agitated; tejah--power; etarhi--thus certainly;
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; tat--that; vidhitsati--desires to do.
TRANSLATION
It is the prowess of these twin asuras [demons] that has disturbed you, for it has minimized your power.
There is no remedy within my power, however, for it is the Lord Himself who desires to do all this.
PURPORT
Although Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa, formerly Jaya and Vijaya, became asuras, the demigods of this
material world could not control them, and therefore Lord Brahma said that neither he nor all the
demigods could counteract the disturbance they created. They came within the material world by the
order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He alone could counteract such disturbances. In other
words, although Jaya and Vijaya assumed the bodies of asuras, they remained more powerful than anyone,
thus proving that the Supreme Personality of Godhead desired to fight because the fighting spirit is also
within Him. He is the original in everything, but when He desires to fight He must fight with a devotee.
Therefore by His desire only were Jaya and Vijaya cursed by the Kumaras. The Lord ordered the
gatekeepers to go down to the material world to become His enemies so that He could fight with them and
His fighting desires would be satisfied by the service of His personal devotees.
Brahma showed the demigods that the situation created by the darkness, for which they were disturbed,
was the desire of the Supreme Lord. He wanted to show that even though these two attendants were
coming in the forms of demons, they were very powerful, greater than the demigods, who could not
control them. No one can surpass the acts of the Supreme Lord. The demigods were also advised not to
try to counteract this incident, because it was ordered by the Lord. Similarly, anyone who is ordered by
the Lord to perform some action in this material world, especially preaching His glories, cannot be
counteracted by anyone; the will of the Lord is executed under all circumstances.
