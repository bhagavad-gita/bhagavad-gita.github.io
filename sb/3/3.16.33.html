TRANSLATION
In the Vaikuntha world there is complete harmony between the residents and the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, just as there is complete harmony within space between the big and the small skies. Why
then is there a seed of fear in this field of harmony? These two persons are dressed like inhabitants of
Vaikuntha, but wherefrom can their disharmony come into existence?
PURPORT
Just as there are different departments in each state in this material world--the civil department and the
criminal department--so, in God's creation, there are two departments of existence. As in the material
world we find that the criminal department is far, far smaller than the civil department, so this material
world, which is considered the criminal department, is one fourth of the entire creation of the Lord. All
living entities who are residents of the material universes are considered to be more or less criminals
because they do not wish to abide by the order of the Lord or they are against the harmonious activities of
God's will. The principle of creation is that the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is by nature
joyful, and He becomes many in order to enhance His transcendental joy. The living entities like
ourselves, being part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, are meant to satisfy the senses of the Lord. Thus,
whenever there is a discrepancy in that harmony, immediately the living entity is entrapped by maya, or
illusion.
The external energy of the Lord is called the material world, and the kingdom of the internal energy of
the Lord is called Vaikuntha, or the kingdom of God. In the Vaikuntha world there is no disharmony
between the Lord and the residents. Therefore God's creation in the Vaikuntha world is perfect. There is
no cause of fear. The entire kingdom of God is such a completely harmonious unit that there is no
possibility of enmity. Everything there is absolute. Just as there are many physiological constructions
within the body yet they work in one order for the satisfaction of the stomach, and just as in a machine
there are hundreds and thousands of parts yet they run in harmony to fulfill the function of the machine,
in the Vaikuntha planets the Lord is perfect, and the inhabitants also perfectly engage in the service of the
Lord.
The Mayavadi philosophers, the impersonalists, interpret this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that
the small sky and the big sky are one, but this idea cannot stand. The example of the big sky and the small
skies is also applicable within a person's body. The big sky is the body itself, and the intestines and other
parts of the body occupy the small sky. Each and every part of the body has individuality, even though
occupying a small part of the total body. Similarly, the whole creation is the body of the Supreme Lord,
and we created beings, or anything that is created, are but a small part of that body. The parts of the body
are never equal to the whole. This is never possible. In Bhagavad-gita it is said that the living entities, who
are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, are eternally parts and parcels. According to the Mayavadi
philosophers, the living entity in illusion considers himself part and parcel although he is actually one and
the same as the supreme whole. This theory is not valid. The oneness of the whole and the part is in their
quality. The qualitative oneness of the small and large portions of the sky does not imply that the small
sky becomes the big sky.
There is no cause for the politics of divide and rule in the Vaikuntha planets; there is no fear, because of
the united interests of the Lord and the residents. Maya means disharmony between the living entities and
the Supreme Lord, and Vaikuntha means harmony between them. Actually all living entities are provided
for and maintained by the Lord because He is the supreme living entity. But foolish creatures, although
actually under the control of the supreme living entity, defy His existence, and that state is called maya.
Sometimes they deny that there is such a being as God. They say, "Everything is void." And sometimes
they deny Him in a different way: "There may be a God, but He has no form." Both these conceptions
arise from the rebellious condition of the living entity. As long as this rebellious condition prevails, the
material world will continue in disharmony.
Harmony or disharmony is realized because of the law and order of a particular place. Religion is the
law and order of the Supreme Lord. In the Srimad Bhagavad-gita we find that religion means devotional
service, or Krsna consciousness. Krsna says, "Give up all other religious principles and simply become a
soul surrendered unto Me." This is religion. When one is fully conscious that Krsna is the supreme
enjoyer and Supreme Lord and one acts accordingly, that is real religion. Anything which goes against this
principle is not religion. Krsna therefore says: "Just give up all other religious principles." In the spiritual
world this religious principle of Krsna consciousness is maintained in harmony, and therefore that world
is called Vaikuntha. If the same principles can be adopted here, wholly or partially, then it is also
Vaikuntha. So it is with any society, such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness: If the
members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, putting faith in Krsna as the center, live
in harmony according to the order and principles of Bhagavad-gita, then they are living in Vaikuntha, not
in this material world.
