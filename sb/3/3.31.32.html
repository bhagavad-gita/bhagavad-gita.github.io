<h2>Text</h2>
yady asadbhih pathi punah
sisnodara-krtodyamaih
asthito ramate jantus
tamo visati purvavat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yadi--if; asadbhih--with the unrighteous; pathi--on the path; punah--again; sisna--for the genitals;
udara--for the stomach; krta--done; udyamaih--whose endeavors; asthitah--associating; ramate--enjoys;
jantuh--the living entity; tamah--darkness; visati--enters; purva-vat--as before.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
If, therefore, the living entity again associates with the path of unrighteousness, influenced by sensually
minded people engaged in the pursuit of sexual enjoyment and the gratification of the palate, he again
goes to hell as before.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It has been explained that the conditioned soul is put into the Andha-tamisra and Tamisra hellish
conditions, and after suffering there he gets a hellish body like the dog's or hog's. After several such
births, he again comes into the form of a human being. How the human being is born is also described by
Kapiladeva. The human being develops in the mother's abdomen and suffers there and comes out again.
After all these sufferings, if he gets another chance in a human body and wastes his valuable time in the
association of persons who are concerned with sexual life and palatable dishes, then naturally he again
glides down to the same Andha-tamisra and Tamisra hells.
Generally, people are concerned with the satisfaction of the tongue and the satisfaction of the genitals.
That is material life. Material life means eat, drink, be merry and enjoy, with no concern for
understanding one's spiritual identity and the process of spiritual advancement. Since materialistic people
are concerned with the tongue, belly and genitals, if anyone wants to advance in spiritual life he must be
very careful about associating with such people. To associate with such materialistic men is to commit
purposeful suicide in the human form of life. It is said, therefore, that an intelligent man should give up
such undesirable association and should always mix with saintly persons. When he is in association with
saintly persons, all his doubts about the spiritual expansion of life are eradicated, and he makes tangible
progress on the path of spiritual understanding. It is also sometimes found that people are very much
addicted to a particular type of religious faith. Hindus, Muslims and Christians are faithful in their
particular type of religion, and they go to the church, temple or mosque, but unfortunately they cannot
give up the association of persons who are too much addicted to sex life and satisfaction of the palate.
Here it is clearly said that one may officially be a very religious man, but if he associates with such
persons, then he is sure to slide down to the darkest region of hell.
