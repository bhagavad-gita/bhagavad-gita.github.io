<h2>Translation</h2>
Philosophical research culminates in understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. After
achieving this understanding, when one becomes free from the material modes of nature, he attains the
stage of devotional service. Either by devotional service directly or by philosophical research, one has to
find the same destination, which is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said in Bhagavad-gita that after many, many lives of philosophical research the wise man ultimately
comes to the point of knowing that Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is everything, and
therefore he surrenders unto Him. Such serious students in philosophical research are rare because they
are very great souls. If by philosophical research one cannot come to the point of understanding the
Supreme Person, then his task is not finished. His search in knowledge is still to be continued until he
comes to the point of understanding the Supreme Lord in devotional service.
The opportunity for direct touch with the Personality of Godhead is given in Bhagavad-gita, where it is
also said that those who take to other processes, namely the processes of philosophical speculation and
mystic yoga practice, have much trouble. After many, many years of much trouble, a yogi or wise
philosopher may come to Him, but his path is very troublesome, whereas the path of devotional service is
easy for everyone. One can achieve the result of wise philosophical speculation simply by discharging
devotional service, and unless one reaches the point of understanding the Personality of Godhead by his
mental speculation, all his research work is said to be simply a labor of love. The ultimate destination of
the wise philosopher is to merge in the impersonal Brahman, but that Brahman is the effulgence of the
Supreme Person. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (14.27), brahmano hi pratisthaham amrtasyavyayasya ca:
"I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is indestructible and is the supreme bliss." The Lord is
the supreme reservoir of all pleasure, including Brahman pleasure; therefore, one who has unflinching
faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead is said to be already realized in impersonal Brahman and
Paramatma.
