samprapede harim bhaktya
prapanna-varadasusam

TRANSLATION
During that period of penance, the sage Kardama, by worship through devotional service in trance,
propitiated the Personality of Godhead, who is the quick bestower of all blessings upon those who flee to
Him for protection.
PURPORT
The significance of meditation is described here. Kardama Muni practiced mystic yoga meditation for
ten thousand years just to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari. Therefore, whether one
practices yoga or speculates and does research to find God, one's efforts must be mixed with the process
of devotion. Without devotion, nothing can be perfect. The target of perfection and realization is the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is clearly said that one who
constantly engages in Krsna consciousness is the topmost yogi. The Personality of Godhead, Hari, also
fulfills the desires of His surrendered devotee. One has to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality
of Godhead, Hari, or Krsna, in order to achieve real success. Devotional service, or engagement in Krsna
consciousness, is the direct method, and all other methods, although recommended, are indirect. In this
age of Kali the direct method is especially more feasible than the indirect because people are short-living,
their intelligence is poor, and they are poverty-stricken and embarrassed by so many miserable
disturbances. Lord Caitanya, therefore, has given the greatest boon: in this age one simply has to chant
the holy name of God to attain perfection in spiritual life.
The words samprapede harim mean that in various ways Kardama Muni satisfied the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Hari, by his devotional service. Devotional service is also expressed by the word
kriya-yogena. Kardama Muni not only meditated but also engaged in devotional service; to attain
perfection in yoga practice or meditation, one must act in devotional service by hearing, chanting,
remembering, etc. Remembering is meditation also. But who is to be remembered? One should remember
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only must one remember the Supreme Person; one must hear
about the activities of the Lord and chant His glories. This information is in the authoritative scriptures.
After engaging himself for ten thousand years in performing different types of devotional service,
Kardama Muni attained the perfection of meditation, but that is not possible in this age of Kali, wherein it
is very difficult to live for as much as one hundred years. At the present moment, who will be successful
in the rigid performance of the many yoga rules and regulations? Moreover, perfection is attained only by
those who are surrendered souls. Where there is no mention of the Personality of Godhead, where is there
surrender? And where there is no meditation upon the Personality of Godhead, where is the yoga
practice? Unfortunately, people in this age, especially persons who are of a demoniac nature, want to be
cheated. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead sends great cheaters who mislead them in the name of
yoga and render their lives useless and doomed. In Bhagavad-gita, therefore, it is clearly stated, in the
Sixteenth Chapter, verse 17, that rascals of self-made authority, being puffed up by illegally collected
money, perform yoga without following the authoritative books. They are very proud of the money they
have plundered from innocent persons who wanted to be cheated.
