<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya said: After hearing of His mother's uncontaminated desire for transcendental realization, the
Lord thanked her within Himself for her questions, and thus, His face smiling, He explained the path of
the transcendentalists, who are interested in self-realization.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti has surrendered her confession of material entanglement and her desire to gain release. Her
questions to Lord Kapila are very interesting for persons who are actually trying to get liberation from
material entanglement and attain the perfectional stage of human life. Unless one is interested in
understanding his spiritual life, or his constitutional position, and unless he also feels inconvenience in
material existence, his human form of life is spoiled. One who does not care for these transcendental
necessities of life and simply engages like an animal in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating has spoiled his
life. Lord Kapila was very much satisfied by His mother's questions because the answers stimulate one's
desire for liberation from the conditional life of material existence. Such questions are called apavargavardhanam.
Those who have actual spiritual interest are called sat, or devotees. Satam prasangat. Sat
means "that which eternally exists," and asat means "that which is not eternal." Unless one is situated on
the spiritual platform, he is not sat; he is asat. The asat stands on a platform which will not exist, but
anyone who stands on the spiritual platform will exist eternally. As spirit soul, everyone exists eternally,
but the asat has accepted the material world as his shelter, and therefore he is full of anxiety. Asad-grahan,
the incompatible situation of the spirit soul who has the false idea of enjoying matter, is the cause of the
soul's being asat. Actually, the spirit soul is not asat. As soon as one is conscious of this fact and takes to
Krsna consciousness, he becomes sat. Satam gatih, the path of the eternal, is very interesting to persons
who are after liberation, and His Lordship Kapila began to speak about that path.
