<h2>Text</h2>
matur jagdhanna-panadyair
edhad-dhatur asammate
sete vin-mutrayor garte
sa jantur jantu-sambhave
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
matuh--of the mother; jagdha--taken; anna-pana--by the food and drink; adyaih--and so on; edhat--
increasing; dhatuh--the ingredients of his body; asammate--abominable; sete--remains; vit-mutrayoh--of
stools and urine; garte--in a hollow; sah--that; jantuh--fetus; jantu--of worms; sambhave--the breeding
place.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Deriving its nutrition from the food and drink taken by the mother, the fetus grows and remains in that
abominable residence of stools and urine, which is the breeding place of all kinds of worms.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Markandeya purana it is said that in the intestine of the mother the umbilical cord, which is
known as apyayani, joins the mother to the abdomen of the child, and through this passage the child
within the womb accepts the mother's assimilated foodstuff. In this way the child is fed by the mother's
intestine within the womb and grows from day to day. The statement of the Markandeya purana about the
child's situation within the womb is exactly corroborated by modern medical science, and thus the
authority of the puranas cannot be disproved, as is sometimes attempted by the Mayavadi philosophers.
Since the child depends completely on the assimilated foodstuff of the mother, during pregnancy there
are restrictions on the food taken by the mother. Too much salt, chili, onion and similar food is forbidden
for the pregnant mother because the child's body is too delicate and new for him to tolerate such pungent
food. Restrictions and precautions to be taken by the pregnant mother, as enunciated in the smrti
scriptures of Vedic literature, are very useful. We can understand from the Vedic literature how much
care is taken to beget a nice child in society. The garbhadhana ceremony before sexual intercourse was
compulsory for persons in the higher grades of society, and it is very scientific. Other processes
recommended in the Vedic literature during pregnancy are also very important. To take care of the child
is the primary duty of the parents because if such care is taken, society will be filled with good population
to maintain the peace and prosperity of the society, country and human race.
