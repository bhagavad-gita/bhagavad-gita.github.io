TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead answered: The yoga system which relates to the Lord and the individual
soul, which is meant for the ultimate benefit of the living entity, and which causes detachment from all
happiness and distress in the material world, is the highest yoga system.
PURPORT
In the material world, everyone is trying to get some material happiness, but as soon as we get some
material happiness, there is also material distress. In the material world one cannot have unadulterated
happiness. Any kind of happiness one has is contaminated by distress also. For example, if we want to
drink milk then we have to bother to maintain a cow and keep her fit to supply milk. Drinking milk is
very nice; it is also pleasure. But for the sake of drinking milk one has to accept so much trouble. The
yoga system, as here stated by the Lord, is meant to end all material happiness and material distress. The
best yoga, as taught in Bhagavad-gita by Krsna, is bhakti-yoga. It is also mentioned in the Gita that one
should try to be tolerant and not be disturbed by material happiness or distress. Of course, one may say
that he is not disturbed by material happiness, but he does not know that just after one enjoys so-called
material happiness, material distress will follow. This is the law of the material world. Lord Kapila states
that the yoga system is the science of the spirit. One practices yoga in order to attain perfection on the
spiritual platform. There is no question of material happiness or distress. It is transcendental. Lord Kapila
will eventually explain how it is transcendental, but the preliminary introduction is given here.
