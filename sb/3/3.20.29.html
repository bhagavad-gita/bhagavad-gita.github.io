<h2>Translation</h2>
The body given up by Brahma took the form of the evening twilight, when the day and night meet, a
time which kindles passion. The asuras, who are passionate by nature, dominated as they are by the
element of rajas, took it for a damsel, whose lotus feet resounded with the tinkling of anklets, whose eyes
were wide with intoxication and whose hips were covered by fine cloth, over which shone a girdle.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As early morning is the period for spiritual cultivation, the beginning of evening is the period for
passion. Demoniac men are generally very fond of sex enjoyment; therefore they very much appreciate the
approach of evening. The demons took the approach of the evening twilight to be a beautiful woman, and
they began to adore her in various ways. They imagined the twilight to be a very beautiful woman with
tinkling bangles on her feet, a girdle on her hips, and beautiful breasts, and for their sexual satisfaction
they imagined the appearance of this beautiful girl before them.
