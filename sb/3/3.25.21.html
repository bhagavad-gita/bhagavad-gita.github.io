<p></p>

titiksavah--tolerant; karunikah--merciful; suhrdah--friendly; sarva-dehinam--to all living entities; ajatasatravah--
inimical to none; santah--peaceful; sadhavah--abiding by scriptures; sadhu-bhusanah--adorned

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities. He has no
enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A sadhu, as described above, is a devotee of the Lord. His concern, therefore, is to enlighten people in
devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord,
human life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country, from door to door, preaching, "Be Krsna
conscious. Be a devotee of Lord Krsna. Don't spoil your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities.
Human life is meant for self-realization, or Krsna consciousness." These are the preachings of a sadhu. He
is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionate
personality towards all the fallen souls. One of his qualifications, therefore, is karunika, great mercy to the
fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work, he has to meet with so many opposing elements, and
therefore the sadhu, or devotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him because the
conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They do
not like it; that is their disease. The sadhu has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance
of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was
crucified, Haridasa Thakura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya's principal
assistant, Nityananda, was violently attacked by Jagai and Madhai. But still they were tolerant because
their mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of a sadhu is that he is very tolerant
and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful because he is the well-wisher of all living entities. He is
not only a well-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It is said here, sarvadehinam,
which indicates all living entities who have accepted material bodies. Not only does the human
being have a material body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The
devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone--the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a
way that they can ultimately get salvation from this material entanglement. Sivananda Sena, one of the
disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are many
instances where a dog got salvation by association with a sadhu, because a sadhu engages in the highest
philanthropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Yet although a sadhu is not inimical
towards anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a sadhu has many enemies.
What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference in behavior. A sadhu behaves
with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relief from material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be
more friendly than a sadhu in relieving a conditioned soul. A sadhu is calm, and he quietly and peacefully
follows the principles of scripture. A sadhu means one who follows the principles of scripture and at the
same time is a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be a devotee
of God because all the sastras instruct us to obey the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Sadhu,
therefore, means a follower of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these
characteristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods,
whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good
characteristics according to the standard of transcendental realization.
