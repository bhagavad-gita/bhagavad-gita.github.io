<h2>Translation</h2>
Now be pleased, my Lord, to dispel my great delusion. Due to my feeling of false ego, I have been
engaged by Your maya and have identified myself with the body and consequent bodily relations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The false ego of identifying one's body as one's self and of claiming things possessed in relationship with
this body is called maya. In Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter, the Lord says, "I am sitting in everyone's
heart, and from Me come everyone's remembrance and forgetfulness." Devahuti has stated that false
identification of the body with the self and attachment for possessions in relation to the body are also
under the direction of the Lord. Does this mean that the Lord discriminates by engaging one in His
devotional service and another in sense gratification? If that were true, it would be an incongruity on the
part of the Supreme Lord, but that is not the actual fact. As soon as the living entity forgets his real,
constitutional position of eternal servitorship to the Lord and wants instead to enjoy himself by sense
gratification, he is captured by maya. This capture by maya is the consciousness of false identification
with the body and attachment for the possessions of the body. These are the activities of maya, and since
maya is also an agent of the Lord, it is indirectly the action of the Lord. The Lord is merciful; if anyone
wants to forget Him and enjoy this material world, He gives him full facility, not directly but through the
agency of His material potency. Therefore, since the material potency is the Lord's energy, indirectly it is
the Lord who gives the facility to forget Him. Devahuti therefore said, "My engagement in sense
gratification was also due to You. Now kindly get me free from this entanglement."
By the grace of the Lord one is allowed to enjoy this material world, but when one is disgusted with
material enjoyment and is frustrated, and when one sincerely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord,
then the Lord is so kind that He frees one from entanglement. Krsna says, therefore, in Bhagavad-gita,
"First of all surrender, and then I will take charge of you and free you from all reactions of sinful
activities." Sinful activities are those activities performed in forgetfulness of our relationship with the
Lord. In this material world, activities for material enjoyment which are considered to be pious are also
sinful. For example, one sometimes gives something in charity to a needy person with a view to getting
back the money four times increased. Giving with the purpose of gaining something is called charity in
the mode of passion. Everything done here is done in the modes of material nature, and therefore all
activities but service to the Lord are sinful. Because of sinful activities we become attracted by the illusion
of material attachment, and we think, "I am this body." I think of the body as myself and of bodily
possessions as "mine." Devahuti requested Lord Kapila to free her from that entanglement of false
identification and false possession.
