<h2>Text</h2>
yada ca partha-prahitah sabhayam
jagad-gurur yani jagada krsnah
na tani pumsam amrtayanani
rajoru mene ksata-punya-lesah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; ca--also; partha-prahitah--being advised by Arjuna; sabhayam--in the assembly; jagatguruh--
of the teacher of the world; yani--those; jagada--went; krsnah--Lord Krsna; na--never; tani--such
words; pumsam--of all men of sense; amrta-ayanani--as good as nectar; raja--the King (Dhrtarastra or
Duryodhana); uru--very important; mene--did consider; ksata--dwindling; punya-lesah--fragment of pious
acts.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Krsna was sent by Arjuna into the assembly as the spiritual master of the whole world, and
although His words were heard by some [like Bhisma] as pure nectar, it was not so for the others, who
were completely bereft of the last farthing of past pious works. The King [Dhrtarastra or Duryodhana] did
not take the words of Lord Krsna very seriously.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Krsna, who is the spiritual master of the entire universe, accepted the duty of a messenger, and,
deputed by Arjuna, went to the assembly of King Dhrtarastra on a peace mission. Krsna is everyone's
Lord, yet because He was the transcendental friend of Arjuna, He gladly accepted the role of messenger,
exactly like an ordinary friend. That is the beauty of the Lord's behavior with His pure devotees. He
reached the assembly and spoke about peace, and the message was relished by Bhisma and other great
leaders because it was spoken by the Lord Himself. But due to the exhaustion of the pious results of their
past deeds, Duryodhana, or his father, Dhrtarastra, did not take the message very seriously. That is the
way of persons who have no credit of pious deeds. By past pious deeds, one may become the king of a
country, but because the results of the pious acts of Duryodhana and company were dwindling, it became
evident from their actions that they were sure to lose the kingdom to the Pandavas. The message of
Godhead is always like nectar to the devotees, but it is just the opposite to the nondevotees. Sugar candy
is always sweet to a healthy man, but it tastes very bitter to persons suffering from jaundice.
