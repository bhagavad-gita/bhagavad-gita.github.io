<h2>Text</h2>
tatas tv ativrajya surastram rddham

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--from there; tu--but; ativrajya--by passing over; surastram--the kingdom of Surat; rddham--very
wealthy; sauvira--the kingdom of Sauvira; matsyan--the kingdom of Matsya; kurujangalan--the kingdom
of western India up to the Delhi province; ca--also; kalena--in course of time; tavat--as soon as;

prominent Yadus; bhagavatam--the great devotee of Lord Krsna; dadarsa--happened to see.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter he passed through very wealthy provinces like Surat, Sauvira and Matsya and through
western India, known as Kurujangala. At last he reached the bank of the Yamuna, where he happened to
meet Uddhava, the great devotee of Lord Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The tract of land comprising about one hundred square miles from modern Delhi to the Mathura district
in Uttar Pradesh, including a portion of the Gurgaon district in Punjab (East India), is considered to be
the topmost place of pilgrimage in all of India. This land is sacred because Lord Krsna traveled through it
many times. From the very beginning of His appearance, He was at Mathura in the house of His maternal
uncle Kamsa, and He was reared by His foster father Maharaja Nanda at Vrndavana. There are still many
devotees of the Lord lingering there in ecstasy in search of Krsna and His childhood associates, the gopis.
It is not that such devotees meet Krsna face to face in that tract of land, but a devotee's eagerly searching
after Krsna is as good as his seeing Him personally. How this is so cannot be explained, but it is factually
realized by those who are pure devotees of the Lord. Philosophically, one can understand that Lord Krsna
and His remembrance are on the absolute plane and that the very idea of searching for Him at Vrndavana
in pure God consciousness gives more pleasure to the devotee than seeing Him face to face. Such devotees
of the Lord see Him face to face at every moment, as confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (5.38):
premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti
yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"Those who are in ecstasy of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Syamasundara
[Krsna], see Him always in their hearts due to love and devotional service rendered to the Lord." Both
Vidura and Uddhava were such elevated devotees, and therefore they both came to the bank of the
Yamuna and met each other.
