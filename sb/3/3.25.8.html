tasya tvam tamaso 'ndhasya

<h2>Translation</h2>
Your Lordship is my only means of getting out of this darkest region of ignorance because You are my
transcendental eye, which, by Your mercy only, I have attained after many, many births.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This verse is very instructive, since it indicates the relationship between the spiritual master and the
disciple. The disciple or conditioned soul is put into this darkest region of ignorance and therefore is
entangled in the material existence of sense gratification. It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement
and attain freedom, but if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master like Kapila
Muni or His representative, then by his grace one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance. The
spiritual master is therefore worshiped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with
the light of the torch of knowledge. The word paragam is very significant. paragam refers to one who can
take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life; the other side is the life of freedom. The
spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge. We are suffering
simply because of ignorance. By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is
removed, and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that
after many, many births one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if, after many,
many births, one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to such a bona fide
representative of Krsna, one can be taken to the side of light.
