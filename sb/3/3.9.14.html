<h2>Text</h2>
sasvat svarupa-mahasaiva nipita-bhedamohaya
bodha-dhisanaya namah parasmai
visvodbhava-sthiti-layesu nimitta-lilarasaya
te nama idam cakrmesvaraya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sasvat--eternally; svarupa--transcendental form; mahasa--by the glories; eva--certainly; nipita--
distinguished; bheda--differentiation; mohaya--unto the illusory conception; bodha--self-knowledge;
dhisanaya--intelligence; namah--obeisances; parasmai--unto the Transcendence; visva-udbhava--creation
of the cosmic manifestation; sthiti--maintenance; layesu--also destruction; nimitta--for the matter of; lila--
by such pastimes; rasaya--for enjoyment; te--unto You; namah--obeisances; idam--this; cakrma--do I
perform; isvaraya--unto the Supreme.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Let me offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Transcendence, who is eternally distinguished by His
internal potency. His indistinguishable impersonal feature is realized by intelligence for self-realization. I
offer my obeisances unto Him who by His pastimes enjoys the creation, maintenance and dissolution of
the cosmic manifestation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Lord is eternally distinguished from the living entities by His internal potency, although
He is also understood in His impersonal feature by self-realized intelligence. Devotees of the Lord,
therefore, offer all respectful obeisances unto the impersonal feature of the Lord. The word rasa is
significant herein. The rasa dance is performed by Lord Krsna in the company of the cowherd damsels at
Vrndavana, and the Personality of Godhead Garbhodakasayi Visnu is also engaged in rasa enjoyment with
His external potency, by which He creates, maintains and dissolves the entire material manifestation.
Indirectly, Lord Brahma offers his respectful obeisances unto Lord Sri Krsna, who is factually ever
engaged in rasa enjoyment with the gopis, as confirmed in the Gopala-tapani Upanisad in the following
words: parardhante so 'budhyata gopa-veso me purusah purastad avirbabhuva. The distinction between
the Lord and the living entity is definitely experienced when there is sufficient intelligence to understand
His internal potency, as distinguished from the external potency by which He makes possible the material
manifestation.
