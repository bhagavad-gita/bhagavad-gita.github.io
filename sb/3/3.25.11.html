<h2>Translation</h2>
Devahuti continued: I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet because You are the only person of whom to
take shelter. You are the ax which can cut the tree of material existence. I therefore offer my obeisances
unto You, who are the greatest of all transcendentalists, and I inquire from You as to the relationship
between man and woman and between spirit and matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sankhya philosophy, as is well known, deals with prakrti and purusa. Purusa is the Supreme personality
of Godhead or anyone who imitates the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an enjoyer, and prakrti means
"nature." In this material world, material nature is being exploited by the purusas, or the living entities.
The intricacies in the material world of the relationship of the prakrti and purusa, or the enjoyed and the
enjoyer, is called samsara, or material entanglement. Devahuti wanted to cut the tree of material
entanglement, and she found the suitable weapon in Kapila Muni. The tree of material existence is
explained in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita as an asvattha tree whose root is upwards and whose
branches are downwards. It is recommended there that one has to cut the root of this material existential
tree with the ax of detachment. What is the attachment? The attachment involves prakrti and purusa. The
living entities are trying to lord it over material nature. Since the conditioned soul takes material nature to
be the object of his enjoyment and he takes the position of the enjoyer, he is therefore called purusa.
Devahuti questioned Kapila Muni, for she knew that only He could cut her attachment to this material
world. The living entities, in the guises of men and women, are trying to enjoy the material energy;
therefore in one sense everyone is purusa because purusa means "enjoyer" and prakrti means "enjoyed."
In this material world both the so-called man and so-called woman are imitating the real purusa; the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the enjoyer in the transcendental sense, whereas all others are
prakrti. The living entities are considered prakrti. In Bhagavad-gita, matter is analyzed as apara, or inferior
nature, whereas beyond this inferior nature there is another, superior nature--the living entities. Living
entities are also prakrti, or enjoyed, but under the spell of maya, the living entities are falsely trying to
take the position of enjoyers. That is the cause of samsara-bandha, or conditional life. Devahuti wanted to
get out of conditional life and place herself in full surrender. The Lord is saranya, which means "the only
worthy personality to whom one can fully surrender," because He is full of all opulences. If anyone
actually wants relief, the best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord
is also described here as sad-dharma-vidam varistham. This indicates that of all transcendental
occupations the best occupation is eternal loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Dharma is sometimes translated as "religion," but that is not exactly the meaning. Dharma actually means
"that which one cannot give up," "that which is inseparable from oneself." The warmth of fire is
inseparable from fire; therefore warmth is called the dharma, or nature, of fire. Similarly, sad-dharma
means "eternal occupation." That eternal occupation is engagement in the transcendental loving service of
the Lord. The purpose of Kapiladeva's Sankhya philosophy is to propagate pure, uncontaminated
devotional service, and therefore He is addressed here as the most important personality amongst those
who know the transcendental occupation of the living entity.
