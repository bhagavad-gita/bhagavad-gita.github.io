<h2>Text</h2>
yopayati sanair maya
yosid deva-vinirmita
tam iksetatmano mrtyum
trnaih kupam ivavrtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ya--she who; upayati--approaches; sanaih--slowly; maya--representation of maya; yosit--woman; deva--
by the Lord; vinirmita--created; tam--her; ikseta--one must regard; atmanah--of the soul; mrtyum--death;
trnaih--with grass; kupam--a well; iva--like; avrtam--covered.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The woman, created by the Lord, is the representation of maya, and one who associates with such maya
by accepting services must certainly know that this is the way of death, just like a blind well covered with
grass.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Sometimes it happens that a rejected well is covered by grass, and an unwary traveler who does not
know of the existence of the well falls down, and his death is assured. Similarly, association with a woman
begins when one accepts service from her, because woman is especially created by the Lord to give service
to man. By accepting her service, a man is entrapped. If he is not intelligent enough to know that she is
the gateway to hellish life, he may indulge in her association very liberally. This is restricted for those who
aspire to ascend to the transcendental platform. Even fifty years ago in Hindu society, such association
was restricted. A wife could not see her husband during the daytime. Householders even had different
residential quarters. The internal quarters of a residential house were for the woman, and the external
quarters were for the man. Acceptance of service rendered by a woman may appear very pleasing, but one
should be very cautious in accepting such service because it is clearly said that woman is the gateway to
death, or forgetfulness of one's self. She blocks the path of spiritual realization.
