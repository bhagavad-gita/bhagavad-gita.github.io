asevayayam prakrter gunanam
jnanena vairagya-vijrmbhitena
yogena mayy arpitaya ca bhaktya
mam pratyag-atmanam ihavarundhe
SYNONYMS
asevaya--by not engaging in the service; ayam--this person; prakrteh gunanam--of the modes of material
nature; jnanena--by Knowledge; vairagya--with renunciation; vijrmbhitena--developed; yogena--by
practicing yoga; mayi--unto Me; arpitaya--fixed; ca--and; bhaktya--with devotion; mam--unto Me;
pratyak-atmanam--the Absolute Truth; iha--in this very life; avarundhe--one attains.
TRANSLATION
Thus by not engaging in the service of the modes of material nature but by developing Krsna
consciousness, knowledge in renunciation, and by practicing yoga, in which the mind is always fixed in
devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one achieves My association in this very life,
for I am the Supreme Personality, the Absolute Truth.
PURPORT
When one engages in devotional service to the Lord in the nine different kinds of bhakti-yoga, as
enunciated in authoritative scriptures, such as hearing (sravanam), chanting (kirtanam), remembering,
offering worship, praying and offering personal service--either in one of them, or two or three or all of
them--he naturally has no opportunity to engage in the service of the three modes of material nature.
Unless one has good engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to get out of the attachment to
material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are interested in so-called humanitarian or
philanthropic work, such as opening a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good
works in the sense that they are pious activities, and their result is that the performer may get some
opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life or in the next. Devotional service, however, is
beyond the boundary of sense gratification. It is completely spiritual activity. When one engages in the
spiritual activities of devotional service, naturally he does not get any opportunity to engage in sense
gratificatory activities. Krsna conscious activities are performed not blindly but with perfect
understanding of knowledge and renunciation. This kind of yoga practice, in which the mind is always
fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The
person who performs such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya,
therefore, approved the process of hearing from realized devotees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does
not matter to what category of this world the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears
about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to conquer the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is unconquerable by any other process. Hearing or associating with devotees is the most
important function for self-realization.
