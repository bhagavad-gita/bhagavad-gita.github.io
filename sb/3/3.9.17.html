<h2>Translation</h2>
People in general all engage in foolish acts, not in the really beneficial activities enunciated directly by
You for their guidance. As long as their tendency for foolish work remains powerful, all their plans in the
struggle for existence will be cut to pieces. I therefore offer my obeisances unto Him who acts as eternal
time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
People in general are all engaged in senseless work. They are systematically unmindful of the real
beneficial work, which is the devotional service of the Lord, technically called the arcana regulations. The
arcana regulations are directly instructed by the Lord in the Narada-pancaratra and are strictly followed
by the intelligent men, who know well that the highest perfectional goal of life is to reach Lord Visnu,
who is the root of the tree called the cosmic manifestation. Also, in the Bhagavatam and in Bhagavad-gita
such regulative activities are clearly mentioned. Foolish people do not know that their self-interest is in
realization of Visnu. The Bhagavatam (7.5.30-32) says:
matir na krsne paratah svato va
mitho 'bhipadyeta grha-vratanam
adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram
punah punas carvita-carvananam
na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum
durasaya ye bahir-artha-maninah
andha yathandhair upaniyamanas
te 'pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah
naisam matis tavad urukramanghrim
sprsaty anarthapagamo yad-arthah
mahiyasam pada-rajo-'bhisekam
niskincananam na vrnita yavat
"Persons who are determined to totally rot in false, material happiness cannot become Krsna-minded
either by instructions from teachers, by self-realization or by parliamentary discussions. They are dragged
by the unbridled senses into the darkest region of ignorance, and thus they madly engage in what is called
'chewing the chewed.'
"Because of their foolish activities, they are unaware that the ultimate goal of human life is to achieve
Visnu, the Lord of the cosmic manifestation, and so their struggle for existence is in the wrong direction
of material civilization, which is under the external energy. They are led by similar foolish persons, just as
one blind man is led by another blind man and both fall in the ditch.
"Such foolish men cannot be attracted towards the activities of the Supreme Powerful, who is actually
the neutralizing measure for their foolish activities, unless and until they have the good sense to be guided
by the great souls who are completely freed from material attachment."
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord asks everyone to give up all other occupational duties and absolutely engage
in arcana activities, or in pleasing the Lord. But almost no one is attracted to such arcana activity.
Everyone is more or less attracted by activities which are conditions of rebellion against the Supreme
Lord. The systems of jnana and yoga are also indirectly rebellious acts against the Lord. There is no
auspicious activity except arcana of the Lord. Jnana and yoga are sometimes accepted within the purview
of arcana when the ultimate aim is Visnu, and not otherwise. The conclusion is that only the devotees of
the Lord are bona fide human beings eligible for salvation. Others are vainly struggling for existence
without any actual benefit.
