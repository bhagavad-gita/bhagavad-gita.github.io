<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, being worshiped by you, will spread my name and fame. He will vanquish
the knot of your heart by becoming your son and teaching knowledge of Brahman.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes to disseminate spiritual knowledge for the benefit of
all people, He generally descends as the son of a devotee, being pleased by the devotee's devotional
service. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father of everyone. No one, therefore, is His father,
but by His inconceivable energy He accepts some of the devotees as His parents and descendants. It is
explained here that spiritual knowledge vanquishes the knot of the heart. Matter and spirit are knotted by
false ego. This identification of oneself with matter, which is called hrdaya-granthi, exists for all
conditioned souls, and it becomes more and more tightened when there is too much affection for sex life.
The explanation was given by Lord Rsabha to His sons that this material world is an atmosphere of
attraction between male and female. That attraction takes the shape of a knot in the heart, and by material
affection it becomes still more tight. For people who hanker after material possessions, society, friendship
and love, this knot of affection becomes very strong. It is only by brahma-bhavana--the instruction by
which spiritual knowledge is enhanced--that the knot in the heart is cut to pieces. No material weapon is
needed to cut this knot, but it requires bona fide spiritual instruction. Kardama Muni instructed his wife,
Devahuti, that the Lord would appear as her son and disseminate spiritual knowledge to cut the knot of
material identification.
