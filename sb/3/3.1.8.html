<h2>Text</h2>
dyute tv adharmena jitasya sadhoh

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dyute--by means of gambling; tu--but; adharmena--by unfair tricks; jitasya--of the vanquished; sadhoh--
a saintly person; satya-avalambasya--one who embraced truth as shelter; vanam--forest; gatasya--of the
goer; na--never; yacatah--when asked for; adat--delivered; samayena--in due course; dayam--right share;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Yudhisthira, who was born without any enemy, was unfairly defeated in gambling. But because he had
taken the vow of truthfulness, he went off to the forest. When he came back in due course and begged the
return of his rightful share of the kingdom, he was refused by Dhrtarastra, who was overwhelmed by
illusion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the rightful heir to his father's kingdom. But just to favor his own sons,
headed by Duryodhana, Dhrtarastra, Maharaja Yudhisthira's uncle, adopted various unfair means to cheat
his nephews of their rightful share of the kingdom. At last the Pandavas demanded only five villages, one
for each of the five brothers, but that was also refused by the usurpers. This incident led to the War of
Kuruksetra. The Battle of Kuruksetra, therefore, was induced by the Kurus, and not the Pandavas.
As ksatriyas, the proper livelihood of the Pandavas was only to rule, and not to accept any other
occupation. A brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya will not accept employment for his livelihood under any
circumstances.
