TRANSLATION
A pure devotee does not accept any kind of liberation--salokya, sarsti, samipya, sarupya or ekatva--even
though they are offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
Lord Caitanya teaches us how to execute pure devotional service out of spontaneous love for the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Siksastaka, He prays to the Lord: "O Lord, I do not wish to gain
from You any wealth, nor do I wish to have a beautiful wife, nor do I wish to have many followers. All I
want from You is that in life after life I may remain a pure devotee at Your lotus feet." There is a similarity
between the prayers of Lord Caitanya and the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Lord Caitanya prays, "in
life after life," indicating that a devotee does not even desire the cessation of birth and death. The yogis
and empiric philosophers desire cessation of the process of birth and death, but a devotee is satisfied to
remain even in this material world and execute devotional service.
It is clearly stated herein that a pure devotee does not desire ekatva, oneness with the Supreme Lord, as
desired by the impersonalists, the mental speculators and the meditators. To become one with the
Supreme Lord is beyond the dream of a pure devotee. Sometimes he may accept promotion to the
Vaikuntha planets to serve the Lord there, but he will never accept merging into the Brahman effulgence,
which he considers worse than hellish. Such ekatva, or merging into the effulgence of the Supreme Lord,
is called kaivalya, but the happiness derived from kaivalya is considered by the pure devotee to be hellish.
The devotee is so fond of rendering service to the Supreme Lord that the five kinds of liberation are not
important to him. If one is engaged in pure transcendental loving service to the Lord, it is understood that
he has already achieved the five kinds of liberation.
When a devotee is promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikuntha, he receives four kinds of facilities. One
of these is salokya, living on the same planet as the Supreme Personality. The Supreme Person, in His
different plenary expansions, lives on innumerable Vaikuntha planets, and the chief planet is Krsnaloka.
Just as within the material universe the chief planet is the sun, in the spiritual world the chief planet is
Krsnaloka. From Krsnaloka, the bodily effulgence of Lord Krsna is distributed not only to the spiritual
world but to the material world as well; it is covered by matter, however, in the material world. In the
spiritual world there are innumerable Vaikuntha planets, and on each one the Lord is the predominating
Deity. A devotee can be promoted to one such Vaikuntha planet to live with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
In sarsti liberation the opulence of the devotee is equal to the opulence of the Supreme Lord. Samipya
means to be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord. In sarupya liberation the bodily features of the
devotee are exactly like those of the Supreme Person but for two or three symptoms found exclusively on
the transcendental body of the Lord. Srivatsa, for example, the hair on the chest of the Lord, particularly
distinguishes Him from His devotees.
A pure devotee does not accept these five kinds of spiritual existence, even if they are offered, and he
certainly does not hanker after material benefits, which are all insignificant in comparison with spiritual
benefits. When Prahlada Maharaja was offered some material benefit, he stated: "My Lord, I have seen that
my father achieved all kinds of material benefits, and even the demigods were afraid of his opulence, but
still, in a second, You have finished his life and all his material prosperity." For a devotee there is no
question of desiring any material or spiritual prosperity. He simply aspires to serve the Lord. That is his
highest happiness.
