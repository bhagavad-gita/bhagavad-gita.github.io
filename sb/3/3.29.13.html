<h2>Text</h2>
evam sva-bharanakalpam
tat-kalatradayas tatha
nadriyante yatha purvam
kinasa iva go-jaram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; sva-bharana--to maintain them; akalpam--unable; tat--his; kalatra--wife; adayah--and so on;
tatha--so; na--not; adriyante--do respect; yatha--as; purvam--before; kinasah--farmers; iva--like; go-jaram--
an old ox.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Seeing him unable to support them, his wife and others do not treat him with the same respect as
before, even as miserly farmers do not accord the same treatment to their old and worn-out oxen.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Not only in the present age but from time immemorial, no one has liked an old man who is unable to
earn in the family. Even in the modern age, in some communities or states, the old men are given poison
so that they will die as soon as possible. In some cannibalistic communities, the old grandfather is
sportingly killed, and a feast is held in which his body is eaten. The example is given that a farmer does
not like an old bull who has ceased to work. Similarly, when an attached person in family life becomes old
and is unable to earn, he is no longer liked by his wife, sons, daughters and other kinsmen, and he is
consequently neglected, what to speak of not being given respect. It is judicious, therefore, to give up
family attachment before one attains old age and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One
should employ himself in the Lord's service so that the Supreme Lord can take charge of him, and he will
not be neglected by his so-called kinsmen.
