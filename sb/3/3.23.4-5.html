<h2>Translation</h2>
The daughter of Manu, who was fully devoted to her husband, looked upon him as greater even than
providence. Thus she expected great blessings from him. Having served him for a long time, she grew
weak and emaciated due to her religious observances. Seeing her condition, Kardama, the foremost of
celestial sages, was overcome with compassion and spoke to her in a voice choked with great love.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The wife is expected to be of the same category as the husband. She must be prepared to follow the
principles of the husband, and then there will be happy life. If the husband is a devotee and the wife is
materialistic, there cannot be any peace in the home. The wife must see the tendencies of the husband and
must be prepared to follow him. From Mahabharata we learn that when Gandhari understood that her
would-be husband, Dhrtarastra, was blind, she immediately began to practice blindness herself. Thus she
covered her eyes and played the part of a blind woman. She decided that since her husband was blind, she
must also act like a blind woman, otherwise she would be proud of her eyes, and her husband would be
seen as inferior. The word samanuvrata indicates that it is the duty of a wife to adopt the special
circumstances in which the husband is situated. Of course, if the husband is as great as Kardama Muni,
then a very good result accrues from following him. But even if the husband is not a great devotee like
Kardama Muni, it is the wife's duty to adapt herself according to his mentality. That makes married life
very happy. It is also mentioned herein that by following the strict vows of a chaste woman, Princess
Devahuti became very skinny, and therefore her husband became compassionate. He knew that she was
the daughter of a great king and yet was serving him just like an ordinary woman. She was reduced in
health by such activities, and he became compassionate and addressed her as follows.
