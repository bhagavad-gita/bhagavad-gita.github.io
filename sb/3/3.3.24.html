descendants of Yadu; bhoja--the descendants of Bhoja; kumarakaih--princes; kopitah--became angry;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Once upon a time, great sages were made angry by the sporting activities of the princely descendants of
the Yadu and Bhoja dynasties, and thus, as desired by the Lord, the sages cursed them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The associates of the Lord who were playing the part of princely descendants of the Yadu and Bhoja
dynasties were not ordinary living entities. It is not possible that they could offend any saintly man or
sage, nor could the sages, who were all pure devotees of the Lord, be influenced to anger by any of the
sporting activities of the princes born in the holy dynasties of Yadu or Bhoja, wherein the Lord Himself
appeared as a descendant. The cursing of the princes by the sages was another transcendental pastime of
the Lord to make a show of anger. The princes were cursed in order that one may know that even the
descendants of the Lord, who could never be vanquished by any act of material nature, were subjected to
the reactions of anger by great devotees of the Lord. One should therefore take great care and attention
not to commit an offense at the feet of a devotee of the Lord.
