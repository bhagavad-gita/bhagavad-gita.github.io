<h2>Text</h2>
mitho yadaisam bhavita vivado
madhv-amadatamra-vilocananam

mayy udyate 'ntardadhate svayam sma
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mithah--one another; yada--when; esam--of them; bhavita--will take place; vivadah--quarrel; madhuamada--
intoxication by drinking; atamra-vilocananam--of their eyes being copper-red; na--not; esam--of
them; vadha-upayah--means of disappearance; iyan--like this; atah--besides this; anyah--alternative;
mayi--on My; udyate--disappearance; antah-dadhate--will disappear; svayam--themselves; sma--certainly.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When they quarrel among themselves, influenced by intoxication, with their eyes red like copper
because of drinking [madhu], then only will they disappear; otherwise, it will not be possible. On My
disappearance, this incident will take place.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord and His associates appear and disappear by the will of the Lord. They are not subjected to the
laws of material nature. No one was able to kill the family of the Lord, nor was there any possibility of
their natural death by the laws of nature. The only means, therefore, for their disappearance was the
make-show of a fight amongst themselves, as if brawling in intoxication due to drinking. That so-called
fighting would also take place by the will of the Lord, otherwise there would be no cause for their
fighting. Just as Arjuna was made to be illusioned by family affection and thus the Bhagavad-gita was
spoken, so the Yadu dynasty was made to be intoxicated by the will of the Lord, and nothing more. The
devotees and associates of the Lord are completely surrendered souls. Thus they are transcendental
instruments in the hands of the Lord and can be used in any way the Lord desires. The pure devotees also
enjoy such pastimes of the Lord because they want to see Him happy. Devotees of the Lord never assert
independent individuality; on the contrary, they utilize their individuality in pursuit of the desires of the
Lord, and this cooperation of the devotees with the Lord makes a perfect scene of the Lord's pastimes.
