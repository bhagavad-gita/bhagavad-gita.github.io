<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, O great sage, please give me instruction on the transcendental devotional service of the Lord,
so that He who is situated in the heart of everyone can be pleased to impart, from within, knowledge of
the Absolute Truth in terms of the ancient Vedic principles delivered only to those who are purified by
the process of devotional service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As already explained in the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Absolute Truth is realized in three
different phases--although they are one and the same--in terms of the knower's capacity to understand.
The most capable transcendentalist is the pure devotee of the Lord, who is without any tinge of fruitive
actions or philosophical speculation. By devotional service only does one's heart become completely
purified from all material coverings like karma, jnana and yoga. Only in such a purified stage does the
Lord, who is seated in everyone's heart with the individual soul, give instruction so that the devotee can
reach the ultimate destination of going back home, back to Godhead. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
(10.10): tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatam. Only when the Lord is satisfied with the devotional service of
the devotee does He impart knowledge, as He did for Arjuna and Uddhava.
The jnanis, yogis and karmis cannot expect this direct cooperation of the Lord. They are not able to
satisfy the Lord by transcendental loving service, nor do they believe in such service to the Lord. The
bhakti process, as performed under the regulative principles of vaidhi-bhakti, or devotional service
following the prescribed rules and regulations, is defined by the revealed scriptures and confirmed by
great acaryas. This practice can help the neophyte devotee to rise to the stage of raga-bhakti, in which the
Lord responds from within as the caitya-guru, or the spiritual master as Superconsciousness. All
transcendentalists other than devotees make no distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul
because they miscalculate the Superconsciousness and the individual consciousness to be one and the
same. Such miscalculation by the nondevotees makes them unfit to receive any direction from within, and
therefore they are bereft of the direct cooperation of the Lord. After many, many births, when such a
nondualist comes to sense that the Lord is worshipable and that the devotee is simultaneously one with
and different from the Lord, then only can he surrender unto the Lord, Vasudeva. Pure devotional service
begins from that point. The process of understanding the Absolute Truth adopted by the misguided
nondualist is very difficult, whereas the devotee's way of understanding the Absolute Truth comes directly
from the Lord, who is pleased by devotional service. On behalf of many neophyte devotees, Vidura, at the
very first instance, inquired from Maitreya about the path of devotional service, by which the Lord, who is
seated within the heart, can be pleased.
