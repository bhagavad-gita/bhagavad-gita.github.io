<h2>Text</h2>
evam kutumba-bharane
vyaprtatmajitendriyah
mriyate rudatam svanam
uru-vedanayasta-dhih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; kutumba-bharane--in maintaining a family; vyaprta--engrossed; atma--his mind; ajita--
uncontrolled; indriyah--his senses; mriyate--he dies; rudatam--while crying; svanam--his relatives; uru--
great; vedanaya--with pain; asta--bereft of; dhih--consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the man, who engaged with uncontrolled senses in maintaining a family, dies in great grief, seeing
his relatives crying. He dies most pathetically, in great pain and without consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that at the time of death one will be absorbed in the thoughts which he
cultivated during his lifetime. A person who had no other idea than to properly maintain his family
members must have family affairs in his last thoughts. That is the natural sequence for a common man.
The common man does not know the destiny of his life; he is simply busy in his flash of life, maintaining
his family. At the last stage, no one is satisfied with how he has improved the family economic condition;
everyone thinks that he could not provide sufficiently. Because of his deep family affection, he forgets his
main duty of controlling the senses and improving his spiritual consciousness. Sometimes a dying man
entrusts the family affairs to either his son or some relative, saying, "I am going. Please look after the
family." He does not know where he is going, but even at the time of death he is anxious about how his
family will be maintained. Sometimes it is seen that a dying man requests the physician to increase his life
at least for a few years so that the family maintenance plan which he has begun can be completed. These
are the material diseases of the conditioned soul. He completely forgets his real engagement--to become
Krsna conscious--and is always serious about planning to maintain his family, although he changes
families one after another.
