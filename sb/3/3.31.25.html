<h2>Text</h2>
sa tadaivatmanatmanam
nihsangam sama-darsanam
heyopadeya-rahitam
arudham padam iksate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--the pure devotee; tada--then; eva--certainly; atmana--by his transcendental intelligence; atmanam--
himself; nihsangam--without material attachment; sama-darsanam--equipoised in vision; heya--to be
rejected; upadeya--acceptable; rahitam--devoid of; arudham--elevated; padam--to the transcendental
position; iksate--he sees.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Because of his transcendental intelligence, the pure devotee is equipoised in his vision and sees himself
to be uncontaminated by matter. He does not see anything as superior or inferior, and he feels himself
elevated to the transcendental platform of being equal in qualities with the Supreme Person.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Perception of the disagreeable arises from attachment. A devotee has no personal attachment to
anything; therefore for him there is no question of agreeable or disagreeable. For the service of the Lord
he can accept anything, even though it may be disagreeable to his personal interest. In fact, he is
completely free from personal interest, and thus anything agreeable to the Lord is agreeable to him. For
example, for Arjuna at first fighting was not agreeable, but when he understood that the fighting was
agreeable to the Lord, he accepted the fighting as agreeable. That is the position of a pure devotee. For his
personal interest there is nothing which is agreeable or disagreeable; everything is done for the Lord, and
therefore he is free from attachment and detachment. That is the transcendental stage of neutrality. A pure
devotee enjoys life in the pleasure of the Supreme Lord.
