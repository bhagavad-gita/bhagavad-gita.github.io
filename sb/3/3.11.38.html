<h2>Text</h2>
kalo 'yam dvi-parardhakhyo
nimesa upacaryate
avyakrtasyanantasya
hy anader jagad-atmanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kalah--eternal time; ayam--this (as measured by Brahma's duration of life); dvi-parardha-akhyah--
measured by the two halves of Brahma's life; nimesah--less than a second; upacaryate--is so measured;
avyakrtasya--of one who is unchanged; anantasya--of the unlimited; hi--certainly; anadeh--of the
beginningless; jagat-atmanah--of the soul of the universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The duration of the two parts of Brahma's life, as above mentioned, is calculated to be equal to one
nimesa [less than a second] for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unchanging and unlimited
and is the cause of all causes of the universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great sage Maitreya has given a considerable description of the time of different dimensions,
beginning from the atom up to the duration of the life of Brahma. Now he attempts to give some idea of
the time of the unlimited Personality of Godhead. He just gives a hint of His unlimited time by the
standard of the life of Brahma. The entire duration of the life of Brahma is calculated to be less than a
second of the Lord's time, and it is explained in the Brahma-samhita (5.48) as follows:
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, whose plenary portion
is Maha-Visnu. All the heads of the innumerable universes [the Brahmas] live only by taking shelter of the
time occupied by one of His breaths." The impersonalists do not believe in the form of the Lord, and thus
they would hardly believe in the Lord's sleeping. Their idea is obtained by a poor fund of knowledge; they
calculate everything in terms of man's capacity. They think that the existence of the Supreme is just the
opposite of active human existence; because the human being has senses, the Supreme must be without
sense perception; because the human being has a form, the Supreme must be formless; and because the
human being sleeps, the Supreme must not sleep. Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, does not agree with such
impersonalists. It is clearly stated herein that the Supreme Lord rests in yoga-nidra, as previously
discussed. And because He sleeps, naturally He must breathe, and the Brahma-samhita confirms that
within His breathing period innumerable Brahmas take birth and die.
There is complete agreement between Srimad-Bhagavatam and the Brahma-samhita. Eternal time is
never lost along with the life of Brahma. It continues, but it has no ability to control the Supreme
Personality of Godhead because the Lord is the controller of time. In the spiritual world there is
undoubtedly time, but it has no control over activities. Time is unlimited, and the spiritual world is also
unlimited, since everything there exists on the absolute plane.
