<h2>Text</h2>

sahankarasya dravyasya
yo 'vasthanam anugrahah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; pratyavamrsya--after understanding; asau--that person; atmanam--his self; pratipadyate--
realizes; sa-ahankarasya--accepted under false ego; dravyasya--of the situation; yah--who; avasthanam--
resting place; anugrahah--the manifester.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When, by mature understanding, one can realize his individuality, then the situation he accepts under
false ego becomes manifest to him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Mayavadi philosophers' position is that at the ultimate issue the individual is lost, everything
becomes one, and there is no distinction between the knower, the knowable and knowledge. But by
minute analysis we can see that this is not correct. Individuality is never lost, even when one thinks that
the three different principles, namely the knower, the knowable and knowledge, are amalgamated or
merged into one. The very concept that the three merge into one is another form of knowledge, and since
the perceiver of the knowledge still exists, how can one say that the knower, knowledge and knowable
have become one? The individual soul who is perceiving this knowledge still remains an individual. Both
in material existence and in spiritual existence the individuality continues; the only difference is in the
quality of the identity. In the material identity, the false ego acts, and because of false identification, one
takes things to be different from what they actually are. That is the basic principle of conditional life.
Similarly, when the false ego is purified, one takes everything in the right perspective. That is the state of
liberation.
It is stated in the Isopanisad that everything belongs to the Lord. Isavasyam idam sarvam. Everything
exists on the energy of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. Because everything is
produced of His energy and exists on His energy, the energy is not different from Him--but still the Lord
declares, "I am not there." When one clearly understands one's constitutional position, everything
becomes manifest. False egoistic acceptance of things conditions one, whereas acceptance of things as
they are makes one liberated. The example given in the previous verse is applicable here: due to
absorption of one's identity in his money, when the money is lost he thinks that he is also lost. But
actually he is not identical with the money, nor does the money belong to him. When the actual situation
is revealed, we understand that the money does not belong to any individual person or living entity, nor is
it produced by man. Ultimately the money is the property of the Supreme Lord, and there is no question
of its being lost. But as long as one falsely thinks, "I am the enjoyer," or "I am the Lord," this concept of
life continues, and one remains conditioned. As soon as this false ego is eliminated, one is liberated. As
confirmed in the Bhagavatam, situation in one's real constitutional position is called mukti, or liberation.
