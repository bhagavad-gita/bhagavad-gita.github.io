ahankara-vimudhasya
kartuh prakrtim iyusah
SYNONYMS
prabhavam--the influence; paurusam--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; prahuh--they have said;
kalam--the time factor; eke--some; yatah--from which; bhayam--fear; ahankara-vimudhasya--deluded by
false ego; kartuh--of the individual soul; prakrtim--material nature; iyusah--having contacted.
TRANSLATION
The influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is felt in the time factor, which causes fear of
death due to the false ego of the deluded soul who has contacted material nature.
PURPORT
The living entity's fear of death is due to his false ego of identifying with the body. Everyone is afraid of
death. Actually there is no death for the spirit soul, but due to our absorption in the identification of body
as self, the fear of death develops. It is also stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.37), bhayam
dvitiyabhinivesatah syat. Dvitiya refers to matter, which is beyond spirit. Matter is the secondary
manifestation of spirit, for matter is produced from spirit. Just as the material elements described are
caused by the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Spirit, the body is also a product of the spirit soul.
Therefore, the material body is called dvitiya, or "the second." One who is absorbed in this second
element or second exhibition of the spirit is afraid of death. When one is fully convinced that he is not his
body, there is no question of fearing death, since the spirit soul does not die.
If the spirit soul engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, he is completely freed from the
platform of birth and death. His next position is complete spiritual freedom from a material body. The fear
of death is the action of the kala, or the time factor, which represents the influence of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. In other words, time is destructive. Whatever is created is subject to destruction
and dissolution, which is the action of time. Time is a representation of the Lord, and it reminds us also
that we must surrender unto the Lord. The Lord speaks to every conditioned soul as time. He says in
Bhagavad-gita that if someone surrenders unto Him, then there is no longer any problem of birth and
death. We should therefore accept the time factor as the Supreme Personality of Godhead standing before
us. This is further explained in the following verse.
