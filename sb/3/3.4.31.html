<h2>Text</h2>
noddhavo 'nv api man-nyuno
yad gunair narditah prabhuh
ato mad-vayunam lokam
grahayann iha tisthatu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; uddhavah--Uddhava; anu--slightly; api--also; mat--to Myself; nyunah--inferior; yat--because;
gunaih--by the modes of material nature; na--nor; arditah--affected; prabhuh--master; atah--therefore;
mat-vayunam--knowledge of Me (the Personality of Godhead); lokam--the world; grahayan--just to
disseminate; iha--in this world; tisthatu--may remain.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Uddhava is not inferior to Me in any way because he is never affected by the modes of material nature.
Therefore he may remain in this world in order to disseminate specific knowledge of the Personality of
Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The specific qualification for becoming the representative of the Lord is to be unaffected by the material
modes of nature. The highest qualification of a person in the material world is to be a brahmana. But since
a brahmana is in the mode of goodness, to be a brahmana is not sufficient for becoming a representative of
the Lord. One has to transcend the mode of goodness also and be situated in unalloyed goodness,
unaffected by any of the qualities of material nature. This stage of transcendental qualification is called
suddha-sattva, or vasudeva, and in this stage the science of God can be realized. As the Lord is not
affected by the modes of material nature, so a pure devotee of the Lord is also not affected by the modes of
nature. That is the primary qualification for being one with the Lord. A person who is able to attain this
transcendental qualification is called jivan-mukta, or liberated, even though he is apparently in material
conditions. This liberation is achieved by one who constantly engages in the transcendental loving service
of the Lord. In Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.2.187) it is stated:
iha yasya harer dasye
karmana manasa gira
nikhilasv apy avasthasu
jivan-muktah sa ucyate
"Anyone who, by his actions, mind and words, lives only for the transcendental loving service of the
Lord, is certainly a liberated soul, even though he may appear to be in a condition of material existence."
Uddhava was in such a transcendental position, and thus he was selected to be the factual representative
of the Lord in His bodily absence from the vision of the world. Such a devotee of the Lord is never
affected by material strength, intelligence or even renunciation. Such a devotee of the Lord can withstand
all onslaughts of material nature, and therefore he is known as gosvami. Only such gosvamis can
penetrate the mysteries of the Lord's transcendental loving relationships.
