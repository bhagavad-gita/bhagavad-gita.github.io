TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead Kapila said: Whatever I speak, whether directly or in the scriptures, is
authoritative in all respects for the people of the world. O Muni, because I told you before that I would
become your son, I have descended to fulfill this truth.
PURPORT
Kardama Muni was to leave his family life to completely engage in the service of the Lord. But since he
knew that the Lord Himself, as Kapila, had taken birth in his home as his own son, why was he preparing
to leave home to search out self-realization or God realization? God Himself was present in his home--
why should he leave home? Such a question may certainly arise. But here it is said that whatever is spoken
in the Vedas and whatever is practiced in accordance with the injunctions of the Vedas is to be accepted
as authoritative in society. Vedic authority says that a householder must leave home after his fiftieth year.
Pancasordhvam vanam vrajet: one must leave his family life and enter the forest after the age of fifty. This
is an authoritative statement of the Vedas, based on the division of social life into four departments of
activity--brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.
Kardama Muni practiced yoga very rigidly as a brahmacari before his marriage, and he became so
powerful and attained so much mystic power that his father, Brahma, ordered him to marry and beget
children as a householder. Kardama did that also; he begot nine good daughters and one son, Kapila
Muni, and thus his householder duty was also performed nicely, and now his duty was to leave. Even
though he had the Supreme Personality of Godhead as his son, he had to respect the authority of the
Vedas. This is a very important lesson. Even if one has God in his home as his son, one should still follow
the Vedic injunctions. It is stated, mahajano yena gatah sa panthah: one should traverse the path which is
followed by great personalities.
Kardama Muni's example is very instructive, for in spite of having the Supreme Personality of Godhead
as his son, he left home just to obey the authority of the Vedic injunction. Kardama Muni states here the
main purpose of his leaving home: while traveling all over the world as a mendicant, he would always
remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart and thereby be freed from all the
anxieties of material existence. In this age of Kali-yuga sannyasa is prohibited because persons in this age
are all sudras and cannot follow the rules and regulations of sannyasa life. It is very commonly found that
so-called sannyasis are addicted to nonsense--even to having private relationships with women. This is the
abominable situation in this age. Although they dress themselves as sannyasis, they still cannot free
themselves from the four principles of sinful life, namely illicit sex life, meat-eating, intoxication and
gambling. Since they are not freed from these four principles, they are cheating the public by posing as
svamis.
In Kali-yuga the injunction is that no one should accept sannyasa. Of course, those who actually follow
the rules and regulations must take sannyasa. Generally, however, people are unable to accept sannyasa
life, and therefore Caitanya Mahaprabhu stressed, kalau nasty eva nasty eva na-sty eva gatir anyatha. In
this age there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative than to chant the holy
name of the Lord: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. The main purpose of sannyasa life is
to be in constant companionship with the Supreme Lord, either by thinking of Him within the heart or
hearing of Him through aural reception. In this age, hearing is more important than thinking because
one's thinking may be disturbed by mental agitation, but if one concentrates on hearing, he will be forced
to associate with the sound vibration of Krsna. Krsna and the sound vibration "Krsna" are nondifferent, so
if one loudly vibrates Hare Krsna, he will be able to think of Krsna immediately. This process of chanting
is the best process of self-realization in this age; therefore Lord Caitanya preached it so nicely for the
benefit of all humanity.
