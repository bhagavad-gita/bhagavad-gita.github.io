<h2>Text</h2>
dehena jiva-bhutena
lokal lokam anuvrajan
bhunjana eva karmani
karoty aviratam puman
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dehena--on account of the body; jiva-bhutena--possessed by the living entity; lokat--from one planet;
lokam--to another planet; anuvrajan--wandering; bhunjanah--enjoying; eva--so; karmani--fruitive
activities; karoti--he does; aviratam--incessantly; puman--the living entity.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Due to his particular type of body, the materialistic living entity wanders from one planet to another,
following fruitive activities. In this way, he involves himself in fruitive activities and enjoys the result
incessantly.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the living entity is encaged in the material body, he is called jiva-bhuta, and when he is free from
the material body he is called brahma-bhuta. By changing his material body birth after birth, he travels
not only in the different species of life, but also from one planet to another. Lord Caitanya says that the
living entities, bound up by fruitive activities, are wandering in this way throughout the whole universe,
and if by some chance or by pious activities they get in touch with a bona fide spiritual master, by the
grace of Krsna, then they get the seed of devotional service. After getting this seed, if one sows it within
his heart and pours water on it by hearing and chanting, the seed grows into a big plant, and there are
fruits and flowers which the living entity can enjoy, even in this material world. That is called the
brahma-bhuta stage. In his designated condition, a living entity is called materialistic, and upon being
freed from all designations, when he is fully Krsna conscious, engaged in devotional service, he is called
liberated. Unless one gets the opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of the
Lord, there is no possibility of one's liberation from the cycle of birth and death in the different species of
life and through the different grades of planets.
