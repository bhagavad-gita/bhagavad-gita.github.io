TRANSLATION
I am the Supersoul of every individual. I am the supreme director and the dearest. People are wrongly
attached to the gross and subtle bodies, but they should be attached to Me only.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is the dearest in both the conditioned and liberated
states. When a person does not know that the Lord is the only dearmost object, then he is in the
conditioned state of life, and when one knows perfectly well that the Lord is the only dearmost object, he
is considered to be liberated. There are degrees of knowing one's relationship with the Lord, depending
on the degree of realization as to why the Supreme Lord is the dearmost object of every living being. The
real reason is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.7). Mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah: the
living entities are eternally parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. The living entity is called the atma, and
the Lord is called the Paramatma. The living entity is called Brahman, and the Lord is called the
Parabrahman, or the Paramesvara. Isvarah paramah krsnah. The conditioned souls, who do not have selfrealization,
accept the material body as the dearmost. The idea of the dearmost is then spread all over the
body, both concentrated and extended. The attachment for one's own body and its extensions like
children and relatives is actually developed on the basis of the real living entity. As soon as the real living
entity is out of the body, even the body of the most dear son is no longer attractive. Therefore the living
spark, or eternal part of the Supreme, is the real basis of affection, and not the body. Because the living
entities are also parts of the whole living entity, that supreme living entity is the factual basis of affection
for all. One who has forgotten the basic principle of his love for everything has only flickering love
because he is in maya. The more one is affected by the principle of maya, the more he is detached from
the basic principle of love. One cannot factually love anything unless he is fully developed in the loving
service of the Lord.
In the present verse, stress is given to focusing love upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
word kuryat is significant here. This means "one must have it." It is just to stress that we must have more
and more attachment to the principle of love. The influence of maya is experienced by the part and parcel
spiritual entity, but it cannot influence the Supersoul, the Paramatma. The Mayavadi philosophers,
accepting the influence of maya on the living entity, want to become one with the Paramatma. But
because they have no actual love for Paramatma, they remain ever entrapped by the influence of maya and
are unable to approach the vicinity of Paramatma. This inability is due to their lack of affection for the
Paramatma. A rich miser does not know how to utilize his wealth, and therefore, in spite of his being very
rich, his miserly behavior keeps him everlastingly a poor man. On the other hand, a person who knows
how to utilize wealth can quickly become a rich man, even with a small credit balance.
The eyes and the sun are very intimately related because without sunlight the eyes are unable to see. But
the other parts of the body, being attached to the sun as a source of warmth, take more advantage of the
sun than do the eyes. Without possessing affection for the sun, the eyes cannot bear the rays of the sun;
or, in other words, such eyes have no capacity to understand the utility of the sun's rays. Similarly, the
empiric philosophers, despite their theoretical knowledge of Brahman, cannot utilize the mercy of the
Supreme Brahman because they lack affection. So many impersonal philosophers remain everlastingly
under the influence of maya Because, although they indulge in theoretical knowledge of Brahman, they do
not develop affection for Brahman nor do they have any scope for development of affection because of
their defective method. A devotee of the sun-god, even though devoid of eyesight, can see the sun-god as
he is even from this planet, whereas one who is not a devotee of the sun cannot even bear the glaring
sunlight. Similarly, by devotional service, even though one is not on the level of a jnani, one can see the
Personality of Godhead within himself due to his development of pure love. In all circumstances one
should try to develop love of Godhead, and that will solve all contending problems.
