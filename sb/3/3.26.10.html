yat tat tri-gunam avyaktam
nityam sad-asad-atmakam
pradhanam prakrtim prahur
avisesam visesavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Supreme Personality of Godhead said; yat--now further; tat--that; tri-gunam--
combination of the three modes; avyaktam--unmanifested; nityam--eternal; sat-asat-atmakam--consisting
of cause and effect; pradhanam--the pradhana; prakrtim--prakrti; prahuh--they call; avisesam--
undifferentiated; visesa-vat--possessing differentiation.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: The unmanifested eternal combination of the three modes is
the cause of the manifest state and is called pradhana. It is called prakrti when in the manifested stage of
existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord points out material nature in its subtle stage, which is called pradhana, and He analyzes this
pradhana. The explanation of pradhana and prakrti is that pradhana is the subtle, undifferentiated sum
total of all material elements. Although they are undifferentiated, one can understand that the total
material elements are contained therein. When the total material elements are manifested by the
interaction of the three modes of material nature, the manifestation is called prakrti. Impersonalists say
that Brahman is without variegatedness and without differentiation. One may say that pradhana is the
Brahman stage, but actually the Brahman stage is not pradhana. pradhana is distinct from Brahman
because in Brahman there is no existence of the material modes of nature. One may argue that the mahattattva
is also different from pradhana because in the mahat-tattva there are manifestations. The actual
explanation of pradhana, however, is given here: when the cause and effect are not clearly manifested
(avyakta), the reaction of the total elements does not take place, and that stage of material nature is called
pradhana. pradhana is not the time element because in the time element there are actions and reactions,
creation and annihilation. Nor is it the jiva, or marginal potency of living entities, or designated,
conditioned living entities, because the designations of the living entities are not eternal. One adjective
used in this connection is nitya, which indicates eternality. Therefore the condition of material nature
immediately previous to its manifestation is called pradhana.
