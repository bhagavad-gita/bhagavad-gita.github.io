jnana-vijnana-yogena
karmanam uddharan jatah
hiranya-kesah padmaksah
padma-mudra-padambujah
SYNONYMS
jnana--of scriptural knowledge; vijnana--and application; yogena--by means of mystic yoga; karmanam--
of material actions; uddharan--uprooting; jatah--the roots; hiranya-kesah--golden hair; padma-aksah--
lotus-eyed; padma-mudra--marked with the sign of the lotus; pada-ambujah--having lotus feet.
TRANSLATION
By mystic yoga and the practical application of knowledge from the scriptures, Kapila Muni, who is
characterized by His golden hair, His eyes just like lotus petals and His lotus feet, which bear the marks of
lotus flowers, will uproot the deep-rooted desire for work in this material world.
PURPORT
In this verse the activities and bodily features of Kapila Muni are very nicely described. The activities of
Kapila Muni are forecast herein: He will present the philosophy of Sankhya in such a way that by studying
His philosophy people will be able to uproot the deep-rooted desire for karma, fruitive activities.
Everyone in this material world engages in achieving the fruits of his labor. A man tries to be happy by
achieving the fruits of his own honest labor, but actually he becomes more and more entangled. One
cannot get out of this entanglement unless he has perfect knowledge, or devotional service.
Those who are trying to get out of the entanglement by speculation are also doing their best, but in the
Vedic scriptures we find that if one has taken to the devotional service of the Lord in Krsna
consciousness, he can very easily uproot the deep-rooted desire for fruitive activities. Sankhya philosophy
will be broadcast by Kapila Muni for that purpose. His bodily features are also described herein. Jnana
does not refer to ordinary research work. Jnana entails receiving knowledge from the scriptures through
the spiritual master by disciplic succession. In the modern age there is a tendency to do research by
mental speculation and concoction. But the man who speculates forgets that he himself is subject to the
four defects of nature: he is sure to commit mistakes, his senses are imperfect, he is sure to fall into
illusion, and he is cheating. Unless one has perfect knowledge from disciplic succession, he simply puts
forth some theories of his own creation; therefore he is cheating people. Jnana means knowledge received
through disciplic succession from the scriptures, and vijnana means practical application of such
knowledge. Kapila Muni's Sankhya system of philosophy is based on jnana and vijnana.
