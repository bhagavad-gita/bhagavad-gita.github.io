<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord replied: O brahmanas, know that the punishment you inflicted on them was originally
ordained by Me, and therefore they will fall to a birth in a demoniac family. But they will be firmly united
with Me in thought through mental concentration intensified by anger, and they will return to My
presence shortly.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord stated that the punishment inflicted by the sages upon the doorkeepers Jaya and Vijaya was
conceived by the Lord Himself. Without the Lord's sanction, nothing can happen. It is to be understood
that there was a plan in the cursing of the Lord's devotees in Vaikuntha, and His plan is explained by
many stalwart authorities. The Lord sometimes desires to fight. The fighting spirit also exists in the
Supreme Lord, otherwise how could fighting be manifested at all? Because the Lord is the source of
everything, anger and fighting are also inherent in His personality. When He desires to fight with
someone, He has to find an enemy, but in the Vaikuntha world there is no enemy because everyone is
engaged fully in His service. Therefore He sometimes comes to the material world as an incarnation in
order to manifest His fighting spirit.
In Bhagavad-gita (4.8) also it is said that the Lord appears just to give protection to the devotees and to
annihilate the nondevotees. The nondevotees are found in the material world, not in the spiritual world;
therefore, when the Lord wants to fight, He has to come to this world. But who will fight with the
Supreme Lord? No one is able to fight with Him! Therefore, because the Lord's pastimes in the material
world are always performed with His associates, not with others, He has to find some devotee who will
play the part of an enemy. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says to Arjuna, "My dear Arjuna, both you and I
have appeared many, many times in this material world, but you have forgotten, whereas I remember."
Thus Jaya and Vijaya were selected by the Lord to fight with Him in the material world, and that was the
reason the sages came to see Him and accidentally the doorkeepers were cursed. It was the Lord's desire to
send them to the material world, not perpetually, but for some time. Therefore, just as on a theatrical
stage someone takes the part of enemy to the proprietor of the stage, although the play is for a short time
and there is no permanent enmity between the servant and the proprietor, so the sura janas (devotees)
were cursed by the sages to go to the asura jana, or atheistic families. That a devotee should come into an
atheistic family is surprising, but it is simply a show. After finishing their mock fighting, both the devotee
and the Lord are again associated in the spiritual planets. That is very explicitly explained here. The
conclusion is that no one falls from the spiritual world, or Vaikuntha planet, for it is the eternal abode.
But sometimes, as the Lord desires, devotees come into this material world as preachers or as atheists. In
each case we must understand that there is a plan of the Lord. Lord Buddha, for example, was an
incarnation, yet he preached atheism: "There is no God." But actually there was a plan behind this, as
explained in the Bhagavatam.
