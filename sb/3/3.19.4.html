TRANSLATION
You rascal, You have been nourished by our enemies to kill us, and You have killed some demons by
remaining invisible. O fool, Your power is only mystic, so today I shall enliven my kinsmen by killing
You.
PURPORT
The demon used the word abhavaya, which means "for killing." Sridhara Svami comments that this
"killing" means liberating, or, in other words, killing the process of continued birth and death. The Lord
kills the process of birth and death and keeps Himself invisible. The activities of the Lord's internal
potency are inconceivable, but by a slight exhibition of this potency, the Lord, by His grace, can deliver
one from nescience. Sucah means "miseries"; the miseries of material existence can be extinguished by the
Lord by His potential energy of internal yogamaya. In the Upanisads (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.8) it is
stated, parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate. The Lord is invisible to the eyes of the common man, but His
energies act in various ways. When demons are in adversity, they think that God is hiding Himself and is
working by His mystic potency. They think that if they can find God they can kill Him just by seeing Him.
Hiranyaksa thought that way, and he challenged the Lord: "You have done tremendous harm to our
community, taking the part of the demigods, and You have killed our kinsmen in so many ways, always
keeping Yourself hidden. Now I see You face to face, and I am not going to let You go. I shall kill You and
save my kinsmen from Your mystic misdeeds."
Not only are demons always anxious to kill God with words and philosophy, but they think that if one
is materially powerful he can kill God with materially fatal weapons. Demons like Kamsa, Ravana and
Hiranyakasipu thought themselves powerful enough to kill even God. Demons cannot understand that
God, by His multifarious potencies, can work so wonderfully that He can be present everywhere and still
remain in His eternal abode, Goloka Vrndavana.
