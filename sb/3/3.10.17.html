<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The fifth creation is that of the controlling deities by the interaction of the mode of goodness, of which
the mind is the sum total. The sixth creation is the ignorant darkness of the living entity, by which the
master acts as a fool.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The demigods in the higher planets are called devas because they are all devotees of Lord Visnu. Visnubhaktah
smrto daiva asuras tad-viparyayah: all the devotees of Lord Visnu are devas, or demigods,
whereas all others are asuras. That is the division of the devas and the asuras. Devas are situated in the
mode of goodness of material nature, whereas the asuras are situated in the modes of passion or
ignorance. The demigods, or controlling deities, are entrusted with departmental management of all the
different functions of the material world. For example, one of our sense organs, the eye, is controlled by
light, light is distributed by the sun rays, and their controlling deity is the sun. Similarly, mind is
controlled by the moon. All other senses, both for working and for acquiring knowledge, are controlled by
the different demigods. The demigods are assistants of the Lord in the management of material affairs.
After the creation of the demigods, all entities are covered by the darkness of ignorance. Each and every
living being in the material world is conditioned by his mentality of lording it over the resources of
material nature. Although a living entity is the master of the material world, he is conditioned by
ignorance, by the false impression of being the proprietor of material things.
The energy of the Lord called avidya is the bewildering factor of the conditioned souls. The material
nature is called avidya, or ignorance, but to the devotees of the Lord engaged in pure devotional service,
this energy becomes vidya, or pure knowledge. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. The energy of the
Lord transforms from mahamaya to yogamaya and appears to pure devotees in her real feature. The
material nature therefore appears to function in three phases: as the creative principle of the material
world, as ignorance and as knowledge. As disclosed in the previous verse, in the fourth creation the power
of knowledge is also created. The conditioned souls are not originally fools, but by the influence of the
avidya function of material nature they are made fools, and thus they are unable to utilize knowledge in
the proper channel.
By the influence of darkness, the conditioned soul forgets his relationship with the Supreme Lord and is
overwhelmed by attachment, hatred, pride, ignorance and false identification, the five kinds of illusion
that cause material bondage.
