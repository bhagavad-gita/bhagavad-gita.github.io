<h2>Text</h2>
devahutir uvaca
sarvam tad bhagavan mahyam
upovaha pratisrutam
athapi me prapannaya
abhayam datum arhasi
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devahutih--Devahuti; uvaca--said; sarvam--all; tat--that; bhagavan--Your Lordship; mahyam--for me;
upovaha--has been fulfilled; pratisrutam--promised; atha api--yet; me--unto me; prapannayai--unto one
who has surrendered; abhayam--fearlessness; datum--to give; arhasi--you deserve.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Devahuti said: My lord, you have fulfilled all the promises you gave me, yet because I am your
surrendered soul, you should give me fearlessness too.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti requested her husband to grant her something without fear. As a wife, she was a fully
surrendered soul to her husband, and it is the responsibility of the husband to give his wife fearlessness.
How one awards fearlessness to his subordinate is mentioned in the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
One who cannot get free from the clutches of death is dependent, and he should not become a spiritual
master, nor a husband, nor a kinsman, nor a father, nor a mother, etc. It is the duty of the superior to give
fearlessness to the subordinate. To take charge of someone, therefore, either as father, mother, spiritual
master, relative or husband, one must accept the responsibility to give his ward freedom from the fearful
situation of material existence. Material existence is always fearful and full of anxiety. Devahuti is saying,
"You have given me all sorts of material comforts by your yogic power, and since you are now prepared to
go away, you must give me your last award so that I may get free from this material, conditional life."
