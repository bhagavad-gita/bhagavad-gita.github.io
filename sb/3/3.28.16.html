<h2>Purport</h2>
Temple worship is one of the duties of a devotee. It is especially recommended for neophytes, but those
who are advanced should not refrain from temple worship. There is a distinction in the manner a
neophyte and an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord's presence in the temple. A neophyte considers the
arca-vigraha (the statue of the Lord) to be different from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers
it a representation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee accepts the Deity
in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not see any difference between the original
form of the Lord and the statue, or arca form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a devotee
whose devotional service is in the highest stage of bhava, or love of Godhead, whereas a neophyte's
worship in the temple is a matter of routine duty.
Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes regularly to see the Deity nicely
decorated, and with veneration and respect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of
worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance in devotional service, a devotee
should see other living entities as spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to
offer respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every living entity originally has
a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel, a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same
equal level of spiritual existence. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, a pandita, one who is learned, sees equally a
very learned brahmana, a sudra, a hog, a dog and a cow. He does not see the body, which is only an
outward dress. He does not see the dress of a brahmana, or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees the spiritual
spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does not see every living entity as part and parcel
of the Supreme Lord, he is considered prakrta-bhakta, a materialistic devotee. He is not completely
situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of devotion. He does, however, show all
respect to the Deity.
Although a devotee sees all living entities on the level of spiritual existence, he is not interested in
associating with everyone. Simply because a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean
that we embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord. We must associate only
with persons who have developed Krsna consciousness.
We should befriend and offer special respect to persons who are developed in Krsna consciousness.
Other living entities are undoubtedly part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their
consciousness is still covered and not developed in Krsna consciousness, we should renounce their
association. It is said by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura that even if one is a Vaisnava, if he is not of good
character his company should be avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a Vaisnava. Anyone
who accepts Visnu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted as a Vaisnava, but a Vaisnava is
expected to develop all the good qualities of the demigods.
The exact meaning of the word sattvena is given by Sridhara Svami as being synonymous with
dhairyena, or patience. One must perform devotional service with great patience. One should not give up
the execution of devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful. One must
continue. Sri Rupa Gosvami also confirms that one should be very enthusiastic and execute devotional
service with patience and confidence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that "Krsna will
certainly accept me because I am engaging in devotional service." One has only to execute service
according to the rules and regulations to insure success.
