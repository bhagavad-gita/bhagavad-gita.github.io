<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--Maitreya said; guna-vyatikara--of the interactions of the modes of material nature;
akarah--source; nirvisesah--without diversity; apratisthitah--unlimited; purusah--of the Supreme Person;
tat--that; upadanam--instrument; atmanam--the material creation; lilaya--by pastimes; asrjat--created.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya said: Eternal time is the primeval source of the interactions of the three modes of material
nature. It is unchangeable and limitless, and it works as the instrument of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead for His pastimes in the material creation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The impersonal time factor is the background of the material manifestation as the instrument of the
Supreme Lord. It is the ingredient of assistance offered to material nature. No one knows where time
began and where it ends, and it is time only which can keep a record of the creation, maintenance and
destruction of the material manifestation. This time factor is the material cause of creation and is therefore
a self expansion of the Personality of Godhead. Time is considered the impersonal feature of the Lord.
The time factor is also explained by modern men in various ways. Some accept it almost as it is
explained in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. For example, in Hebrew literature time is accepted, in the same
spirit, as a representation of God. It is stated therein: "God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners
spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets...." Metaphysically, time is distinguished as absolute
and real. Absolute time is continuous and is unaffected by the speed or slowness of material things. Time
is astronomically and mathematically calculated in relation to the speed, change and life of a particular
object. Factually, however, time has nothing to do with the relativities of things; rather, everything is
shaped and calculated in terms of the facility offered by time. Time is the basic measurement of the
activity of our senses, by which we calculate past, present and future; but in factual calculation, time has
no beginning and no end. Canakya Pandita says that even a slight fraction of time cannot be purchased
with millions of dollars, and therefore even a moment of time lost without profit must be calculated as the
greatest loss in life. Time is not subject to any form of psychology, nor are the moments objective realities
in themselves, but they are dependent on particular experiences.
Therefore, Srila Jiva Gosvami concludes that the time factor is intermixed with the activities--actions
and reactions--of the external energy of the Lord. The external energy, or material nature, works under
the superintendence of the time factor as the Lord Himself, and that is why material nature appears to
have produced so many wonderful things in the cosmic manifestation. Bhagavad-gita (9.10) confirms this
conclusion as follows:
mayadhyaksena prakrtih
suyate sa-caracaram
hetunanena kaunteya
jagad viparivartate
