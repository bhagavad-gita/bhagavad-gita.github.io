along with; vrttibhih--occupational duty.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
All these different social divisions are born, with their occupational duties and living conditions, from
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus for unconditional life and self-realization one has to worship
the Supreme Lord under the direction of the spiritual master.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since they are born from different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord in His gigantic form, all living
entities in all parts of the entire universe are supposed to he eternal servitors of the supreme body. Every
part of our own body, such as the mouth, hands, thighs and legs, is meant to render service to the whole.
That is their constitutional position. In subhuman life the living entities are not conscious of this
constitutional position, but in the human form of life they are supposed to know this through the system
of the varnas, the social orders. As above mentioned, the brahmana is the spiritual master of all the orders
of society, and thus brahminical culture, culminating in the transcendental service of the Lord, is the basic
principle for purifying the soul.
In conditioned life the soul is under the impression that he can become the lord of the universe, and the
last point of this misconception is to think oneself the Supreme. The foolish conditioned soul does not
take into account that the Supreme cannot be conditioned by maya, or illusion. If the Supreme were to
become conditioned by illusion, where would be His supremacy? In that case, maya, or illusion, would be
the Supreme. Therefore, because the living entities are conditioned, they cannot be supreme. The actual
position of the conditioned soul is explained in this verse: all the conditioned souls are impure due to
contact with the material energy in three modes of nature. Therefore it is necessary that they purify
themselves under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, who not only is a brahmana by
qualification but must also be a Vaisnava. The only self-purifying process mentioned herein is to worship
the Lord under the recognized method--under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master. That is the
natural way of purification, and no other method is recommended as bona fide. The other methods of
purification may be helpful to come to this stage of life, but ultimately one has to come to this last point
before he attains actual perfection. Bhagavad-gita (7.19) confirms this truth as follows:
bahunam janmanam ante
jnanavan mam prapadyate
vasudevah sarvam iti
sa mahatma sudurlabhah
