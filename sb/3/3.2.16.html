<h2>Text</h2>
mam khedayaty etad ajasya janmavidambanam
yad vasudeva-gehe
vraje ca vaso 'ri-bhayad iva svayam
purad vyavatsid yad-ananta-viryah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mam--to me; khedayati--gives me distress; etat--this; ajasya--of the unborn; janma--birth; vidambanam--
bewildering; yat--that; vasudeva-gehe--in the home of Vasudeva; vraje--in Vrndavana; ca--also; vasah--
inhabitation; ari--enemy; bhayat--because of fear; iva--as if; svayam--Himself; purat--from Mathura Puri;
vyavatsit--fled; yat--one who is; ananta-viryah--unlimitedly powerful.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When I think of Lord Krsna--how He was born in the prison house of Vasudeva although He is unborn,
how He went away from His father's protection to Vraja and lived there incognito out of fear of the
enemy, and how, although unlimitedly powerful, He fled from Mathura in fear--all these bewildering
incidents give me distress.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because Lord Sri Krsna is the original person from whom everything and everyone has emanated--aham
sarvasya prabhavah (Bg. 10.8), janmady asya yatah (Vedanta-sutra 1.1.2)--nothing can be equal to or
greater than Him. The Lord is supremely perfect, and whenever He enacts His transcendental pastimes as
a son, a rival or an object of enmity, He plays the part so perfectly that even pure devotees like Uddhava
are bewildered. For example, Uddhava knew perfectly well that Lord Sri Krsna is eternally existent and
can neither die nor disappear for good, yet he lamented for Lord Krsna. All these events are perfect
arrangements to give perfection to His supreme glories. It is for enjoyment's sake. When a father plays
with his little son and the father lies down on the floor as if defeated by the son, it is just to give the little
son pleasure, and nothing more. Because the Lord is all-powerful, it is possible for Him to adjust
opposites such as birth and no birth, power and defeat, fear and fearlessness. A pure devotee knows very
well how it is possible for the Lord to adjust opposite things, but he laments for the nondevotees who, not
knowing the supreme glories of the Lord, think of Him as imaginary simply because there are so many
apparently contradictory statements in the scriptures. Factually there is nothing contradictory; everything
is possible when we understand the Lord as the Lord and not as one of us, with all our imperfection.
