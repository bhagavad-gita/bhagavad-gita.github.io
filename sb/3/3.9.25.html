<h2>Text</h2>
so 'sav adabhra-karuno bhagavan vivrddhaprema-
smitena nayanamburuham vijrmbhan
utthaya visva-vijayaya ca no visadam

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--He (the Lord); asau--that; adabhra--unlimited; karunah--merciful; bhagavan--the Personality of
Godhead; vivrddha--excessive; prema--love; smitena--by smiling; nayana-amburuham--the lotus eyes;
vijrmbhan--by opening; utthaya--for flourishing; visva-vijayaya--for glorifying the cosmic creation; ca--as
also; nah--our; visadam--dejection; madhvya--by sweet; gira--words; apanayatat--let Him kindly remove;
purusah--the Supreme; puranah--oldest.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, who is supreme and is the oldest of all, is unlimitedly merciful. I wish that He may smilingly
bestow His benediction upon me by opening His lotus eyes. He can uplift the entire cosmic creation and
remove our dejection by kindly speaking His directions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is ever increasingly merciful upon the fallen souls of this material world. The whole cosmic
manifestation is a chance for all to improve themselves in devotional service to the Lord, and everyone is
meant for that purpose. The Lord expands Himself into many personalities who are either self-expansions
or separated expansions. The personalities of the individual souls are His separated expansions, whereas
the self-expansions are the Lord Himself. The self-expansions are predominators, and the separated
expansions are predominated for reciprocation of transcendental bliss with the supreme form of bliss and
knowledge. The liberated souls can join in this blissful reciprocation of predominator and predominated
without materially concocted ideas. The typical example of such a transcendental exchange between the
predominator and the predominated is the Lord's rasa-lila with the gopis. The gopis are predominated
expansions of the internal potency, and therefore the Lord's participation in the rasa-lila dance is never to
be considered like the mundane relationship of man and woman. It is, rather, the highest perfectional
stage of the exchange of feelings between the Lord and the living entities. The Lord gives the fallen souls
the chance for this highest perfection of life. Lord Brahma is entrusted with the management of the
complete cosmic show, and therefore he prays that the Lord bestow His blessings upon him so that he
may execute its purpose.
