<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
tav asvasya jagat-srasta
kumaraih saha-naradah
hamso hamsena yanena
tri-dhama-paramam yayau
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--Maitreya said; tau--the couple; asvasya--having reassured; jagat-srasta--the creator of
the universe; kumaraih--along with the Kumaras; saha-naradah--with Narada; hamsah--Lord Brahma;
hamsena yanena--by his swan carrier; tri-dhama-paramam--to the highest planetary system; yayau--went.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: After thus speaking to Kardama Muni and his wife Devahuti, Lord Brahma, the creator
of the universe, who is also known as Hamsa, went back to the highest of the three planetary systems on
his swan carrier with the four Kumaras and Narada.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words hamsena yanena are very significant here. Hamsa-yana, the airplane by which Brahma travels
all over outer space, resembles a swan. Brahma is also known as Hamsa because he can grasp the essence
of everything. His abode is called tri-dhama-paramam. There are three divisions of the universe--the
upper planetary system, the middle planetary system and the lower planetary system--but his abode is
above even Siddhaloka, the upper planetary system. He returned to his own planet with the four Kumaras
and Narada because they were not going to be married. The other rsis who came with him, such as Marici
and Atri, remained there because they were to be married to the daughters of Kardama, but his other
sons-- Sanat, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Narada--went back with him in his swan-shaped airplane.
The four Kumaras and Narada are naisthika-brahmacaris. Naisthika-brahmacari refers to one who never
wastes his semen at any time. They were not to attend the marriage ceremony of their other brothers,
Marici and the other sages, and therefore they went back with their father, Hamsa.
