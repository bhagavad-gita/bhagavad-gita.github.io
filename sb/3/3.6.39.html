<h2>Text</h2>
ato bhagavato maya
mayinam api mohini
yat svayam catma-vartmatma
na veda kim utapare
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atah--therefore; bhagavatah--godly; maya--potencies; mayinam--of the jugglers; api--even; mohini--
enchanting; yat--that which; svayam--personally; ca--also; atma-vartma--self-sufficient; atma--self; na--
does not; veda--know; kim--what; uta--to speak of; apare--others.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The wonderful potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is bewildering even to the jugglers. That
potential power is unknown even to the self-sufficient Lord, so it is certainly unknown to others.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The froggish philosophers and mundane wranglers in science and mathematical calculation may not
believe in the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they are sometimes
puzzled by the wonderful jugglery of man and nature. Such jugglers and magicians of the mundane world
are actually puzzled by the jugglery of the Lord in His transcendental activities, but they try to adjust their
bewilderment by saying that it is all mythology. There is, however, nothing impossible or mythological in
the Supreme Omnipotent Person. The most wonderful puzzle for the mundane wranglers is that while
they remain calculating the length and breadth of the unlimited potency of the Supreme Person, His
faithful devotees are set free from the bondage of material encagement simply by appreciating the
wonderful jugglery of the Supreme in the practical field. The devotees of the Lord see the wonderful
dexterity in everything with which they come in contact in all circumstances of eating, sleeping, working,
etc. A small banyan fruit contains thousands of small seeds, and each seed holds the potency of another
tree, which again holds the potency of many millions of such fruits as causes and effects. So the trees and
seeds engage the devotees in meditation about the activities of the Lord, while the mundane wranglers
waste time in dry speculation and mental concoction, which are fruitless in both this life and the next. In
spite of their pride in speculation, they can never appreciate the simple potential activities of the banyan
tree. Such speculators are poor souls destined to remain in matter perpetually.
