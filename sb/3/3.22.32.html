<h2>Text</h2>
barhismatim nama vibhur
yam nirvisya samavasat
tasyam pravisto bhavanam
tapa-traya-vinasanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
barhismatim--the city Barhismati; nama--named; vibhuh--the very powerful Svayambhuva Manu; yam--
which; nirvisya--having entered; samavasat--he lived in previously; tasyam--in that city; pravistah--
entered; bhavanam--the palace; tapa-traya--the threefold miseries; vinasanam--destroying.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Having entered the city of Barhismati, in which he had previously lived, Manu entered his palace, which
was filled with an atmosphere that eradicated the three miseries of material existence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world, or material existential life, is filled with threefold miseries: miseries pertaining to
the body and mind, miseries pertaining to natural disturbances and miseries inflicted by other living
entities. Human society is meant to create a spiritual atmosphere by spreading the spirit of Krsna
consciousness. The miseries of material existence cannot affect the status of Krsna consciousness. It is not
that the miseries of the material world completely vanish when one takes to Krsna consciousness, but for
one who is Krsna conscious the miseries of material existence have no effect. We cannot stop the miseries
of the material atmosphere, but Krsna consciousness is the antiseptic method to protect us from being
affected by the miseries of material existence. For a Krsna conscious person, both living in heaven and
living in hell are equal. How Svayambhuva Manu created an atmosphere wherein he was not affected by
material miseries is explained in the following verses.
