<h2>Translation</h2>
By his piety, Vidura achieved the advantages of the pious Kauravas. After leaving Hastinapura, he took
shelter of many places of pilgrimages, which are the Lord's lotus feet. With a desire to gain a high order of
pious life, he traveled to holy places where thousands of transcendental forms of the Lord are situated.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vidura was undoubtedly a highly elevated and pious soul, otherwise he would not have taken his birth
in the Kaurava family. To have high parentage, to possess wealth, to be highly learned and to have great
personal beauty are all due to past pious acts. But such pious possessions are not sufficient for obtaining
the grace of the Lord and being engaged in His transcendental loving service. Vidura considered himself
less pious, and therefore he decided to travel to all the great places of pilgrimage in the world in order to
achieve greater piety and advance nearer to the Lord. At that time, Lord Krsna was personally present in
the world, and Vidura could have at once approached Him directly, but he did not do so because he was
not sufficiently freed from sin. One cannot be one hundred percent devoted to the Lord unless and until
he is completely free from all effects of sin. Vidura was conscious that by the association of the diplomatic
Dhrtarastra and Duryodhana he had lost his piety and was therefore not fit to associate at once with the
Lord. In Bhagavad-gita (7.28) this is confirmed in the following verse:
yesam tv anta-gatam papam
jananam punya-karmanam
te dvandva-moha-nirmukta
bhajante mam drdha-vratah
Persons who are sinful asuras like Kamsa and Jarasandha cannot think of Lord Krsna as the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. Only those who are pure devotees, those who follow the
regulative principles of religious life as prescribed in the scriptures, are able to engage themselves in
karma-yoga and then jnana-yoga and thereafter, by pure meditation, can understand pure consciousness.
When God consciousness is developed, one can take advantage of the association of pure devotees. Syan
mahat-sevaya viprah punya-tirtha-nisevanat: one is able to associate with the Lord even during the
existence of this life.
Places of pilgrimages are meant for eradicating the sins of the pilgrims, and they are distributed all over
the universe just to give facility to all concerned for attaining pure existence and God realization. One
should not be satisfied, however, merely by visiting the places of pilgrimage and performing one's
prescribed duties; he should be eager to meet the great souls who are already there, engaged in the service
of the Lord. In each and every place of pilgrimage, the Lord is present in His various transcendental
forms.
These forms are called arca-murtis, or forms of the Lord which can be easily appreciated by the common
man. The Lord is transcendental to our mundane senses. He cannot be seen with our present eyes, nor
can He be heard with our present ears. To the degree that we have entered into the service of the Lord or
to the proportion to which our lives are freed from sins, we can perceive the Lord. But even though we are
not free from sins, the Lord is kind enough to allow us the facility of seeing Him in His arca-murtis in the
temple. The Lord is all-powerful, and therefore He is able to accept our service by presentation of His arca
form. No one, therefore, should foolishly think the arca in the temple to be an idol. Such an arca-murti is
not an idol but the Lord Himself, and to the proportion to which one is free from sins, he is able to know
the significance of the arca-murti. The guidance of a pure devotee is therefore always required.
In the land of Bharatavarsa there are many hundreds and thousands of places of pilgrimage distributed
all over the country, and by traditional practice the common man visits such holy places during all
seasons of the year. Some of the arca representations of the Lord situated in different places of pilgrimage
are mentioned herewith. The Lord is present at Mathura (the birthplace of Lord Krsna) as Adi-kesava; the
Lord is present at Puri (Orissa) as Lord Jagannatha (also known as Purusottama); He is present at
Allahabad (Prayaga) as Bindu-madhava; at Mandara Hill He is present as Madhusudana. In the
Anandaranya, He is known as Vasudeva, Padmanabha and Janardana; at Visnukanci, He is known as
Visnu; and at Mayapura, He is known as Hari. There are millions and billions of such arca forms of the
Lord distributed all over the universe. All these arca-murtis are summarized in the Caitanya-caritamrta in
the following words:
sarvatra prakasa tanra----bhakte sukha dite
jagatera adharma nasi' dharma sthapite
"The Lord has so distributed Himself all over the universe just to give pleasure to the devotees, to give
the common man facility to eradicate his sins, and to establish religious principles in the world."
