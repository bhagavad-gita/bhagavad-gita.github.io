<h2>Text</h2>
nanyatra mad bhagavatah
pradhana-purusesvarat
atmanah sarva-bhutanam
bhayam tivram nivartate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; anyatra--otherwise; mat--than Myself; bhagavatah--the Supreme personality of Godhead;
pradhana-purusa-isvarat--the Lord of both prakrti and purusa; atmanah--the soul; sarva-bhutanam--of all
living beings; bhayam--fear; tivram--terrible; nivartate--is forsaken.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The terrible fear of birth and death can never be forsaken by anyone who resorts to any shelter other
than Myself, for I am the almighty Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the original source of all
creation, and also the Supreme Soul of all souls.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is indicated herein that the cycle of birth and death cannot be stopped unless one is a pure devotee of
the Supreme Lord. It is said, harim vina na srtim taranti. One cannot surpass the cycle of birth and death
unless one is favored by the Supreme personality of Godhead. The same concept is confirmed herewith:
one may take to the system of understanding the Absolute Truth by one's own imperfect sensory
speculation, or one may try to realize the self by the mystic yoga process; but whatever one may do, unless
he comes to the point of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no process can give him
liberation. One may ask if this means that those who are undergoing so much penance and austerity by
strictly following the rules and regulations are endeavoring in vain. The answer is given by Srimad-
Bhagavatam (10.2.32): ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninah. Lord Brahma and other demigods prayed to
the Lord when Krsna was in the womb of Devaki: "My dear lotus-eyed Lord, there are persons who are
puffed up with the thought that they have become liberated or one with God or have become God, but in
spite of thinking in such a puffed-up way, their intelligence is not laudable. They are less intelligent." It is
stated that their intelligence, whether high or low, is not even purified. In purified intelligence a living
entity cannot think otherwise than to surrender. Bhagavad-gita, therefore, confirms that purified
intelligence arises in the person of a very wise man. Bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate.
After many, many births, one who is actually advanced in intelligence surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.
Without the surrendering process, one cannot achieve liberation. The Bhagavatam says, "Those who are
simply puffed up, thinking themselves liberated by some nondevotional process, are not polished or clear
in intelligence, for they have not yet surrendered unto You. In spite of executing all kinds of austerities
and penances or even arriving at the brink of spiritual realization in Brahman realization, they think that
they are in the effulgence of Brahman, but actually, because they have no transcendental activities, they
fall down to material activities." One should not be satisfied simply with knowing that one is Brahman. He
must engage himself in the service of the Supreme Brahman; that is bhakti. The engagement of Brahman
should be the service of Parabrahman. It is said that unless one becomes Brahman one cannot serve
Brahman. The Supreme Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the living entity is also
Brahman. Without realization that he is Brahman, spirit soul, an eternal servitor of the Lord, if one simply
thinks that he is Brahman, his realization is only theoretical. He has to realize and at the same time engage
himself in the devotional service of the Lord; then he can exist in the Brahman status. Otherwise he falls
down.
The Bhagavatam says that because nondevotees neglect the transcendental loving service of the lotus
feet of the Personality of Godhead, their intelligence is not sufficient, and therefore these persons fall
down. The living entity must have some activity. If he does not engage in the activity of transcendental
service, he must fall down to material activity. As soon as one falls down to material activity, there is no
rescue from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated here by Lord Kapila, "Without My mercy" (nanyatra
mad bhagavatah). The Lord is stated here to be Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, indicating
that He is full of all opulences and is therefore perfectly competent to deliver one from the cycle of birth
and death. He is also called pradhana because He is the Supreme. He is equal to everyone, but to one who
surrenders to Him He is especially favorable. It is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that the Lord is equal to
everyone; no one is His enemy and no one is His friend. But to one who surrenders unto Him, He is
especially inclined. By the grace of the Lord, simply by surrendering unto Him one can get out of this
cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, one may go on in many, many lives and may many times attempt
other processes for liberation.
