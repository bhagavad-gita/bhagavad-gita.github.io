<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhuta--the five elements; indriya--the senses; antah-karanat--from the mind; pradhanat--from the
pradhana; jiva-samjnitat--from the jiva soul; atma--the Paramatma; tatha--so; prthak--different; drasta--the
seer; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; brahma-samjnitah--called Brahman.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Parambrahma, is the seer. He is different from
the jiva soul, or individual living entity, who is combined with the senses, the five elements and
consciousness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A clear conception of the complete whole is given herewith. The living entity is different from the
material elements, and the supreme living entity, the Personality of Godhead, who is the creator of the
material elements, is also different from the individual living entity. This philosophy is propounded by
Lord Caitanya as acintya-bhedabheda-tattva. Everything is simultaneously one with and different from
everything else. The cosmic manifestation created by the Supreme Lord by His material energy is also
simultaneously different and nondifferent from Him. The material energy is nondifferent from the
Supreme Lord, but at the same time, because that energy is acting in a different way, it is different from
Him. Similarly, the individual living entity is one with and different from the Supreme Lord. This
"simultaneously one and different" philosophy is the perfect conclusion of the Bhagavata school, as
confirmed here by Kapiladeva.
Living entities are compared to the sparks of a fire. As stated in the previous verse, fire, flame, smoke
and firewood are combined together. Here the living entity, the material elements and the Supreme
Personality of Godhead are combined together. The exact position of the living entities is just like that of
the sparks of a fire; they are part and parcel. The material energy is compared to the smoke. The fire is
also part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. In the Visnu purana it is said that whatever we can see or
experience, either in the material or spiritual world, is an expansion of the different energies of the
Supreme Lord. As fire distributes its light and heat from one place, the Supreme Personality of Godhead
distributes His different energies all over His creation.
The four principles of the Vaisnava philosophic doctrine are suddha-advaita (purified oneness), dvaitaadvaita
(simultaneous oneness and difference), visista-advaita and dvaita. All four principles of Vaisnava
philosophy are based on the thesis of Srimad-Bhagavatam explained in these two verses.
