<h2>Text</h2>
asaknuvams tad-viraham
muncan baspa-kalam muhuh
asincad amba vatseti
netrodair duhituh sikhah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
asaknuvan--being unable to bear; tat-viraham--separation from her; muncan--shedding; baspa-kalam--
tears; muhuh--again and again; asincat--he drenched; amba--my dear mother; vatsa--my dear daughter;
iti--thus; netra-udaih--by the water from his eyes; duhituh--of his daughter; sikhah--the locks of hair.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Emperor was unable to bear the separation of his daughter. Therefore tears poured from his eyes
again and again, drenching his daughter's head as he cried, "My dear mother! My dear daughter!"
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word amba is significant. A father sometimes addresses his daughter in affection as "mother" and
sometimes as "my darling." The feeling of separation occurs because until the daughter is married she
remains the daughter of the father, but after her marriage she is no longer claimed as a daughter in the
family; she must go to the husband's house, for after marriage she becomes the property of the husband.
According to Manu-samhita, a woman is never independent. She must remain the property of the father
while she is not married, and she must remain the property of the husband until she is elderly and has
grown-up children of her own. In old age, when the husband has taken sannyasa and left home, she
remains the property of the sons. A woman is always dependent, either upon the father, husband or
elderly sons. That will be exhibited in the life of Devahuti. Devahuti's father handed over responsibility
for her to the husband, Kardama Muni, and in the same way, Kardama Muni also left home, giving the
responsibility to his son, Kapiladeva. This narration will describe these events one after another.
