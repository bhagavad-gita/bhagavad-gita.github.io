<h2>Text</h2>
tam prarthayantim lalana-lalamam
asevita-sri-caranair adrstam
vatsam manor uccapadah svasaram
ko nanumanyeta budho 'bhiyatam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--her; prarthayantim--seeking; lalana-lalamam--the ornament of women; asevita-sri-caranaih--by
those who have not worshiped the feet of Laksmi; adrstam--not seen; vatsam--beloved daughter; manoh--
of Svayambhuva Manu; uccapadah--of Uttanapada; svasaram--sister; kah--what; na anumanyeta--would
not welcome; budhah--wise man; abhiyatam--who has come of her own accord.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What wise man would not welcome her, the very ornament of womanhood, the beloved daughter of
Svayambhuva Manu and sister of Uttanapada? Those who have not worshiped the gracious feet of the
goddess of fortune cannot even perceive her, yet she has come of her own accord to seek my hand.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni praised the beauty and qualification of Devahuti in different ways. Devahuti was actually
the ornament of all ornamented beautiful girls. A girl becomes beautiful by putting ornaments on her
body, but Devahuti was more beautiful than the ornaments; she was considered the ornament of the
ornamented beautiful girls. Demigods and Gandharvas were attracted by her beauty. Kardama Muni,
although a great sage, was not a denizen of the heavenly planets, but it is mentioned in the previous verse
that Visvavasu, who came from heaven, was also attracted by the beauty of Devahuti. Besides her personal
beauty, she was the daughter of Emperor Svayambhuva and sister of King Uttanapada. Who could refuse
the hand of such a girl?
