<h2>Translation</h2>
Certainly others who were fighters on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra were purified by the onslaught of
Arjuna's arrows, and while seeing the lotuslike face of Krsna, so pleasing to the eyes, they achieved the
abode of the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, appears in this world for two missionary
purposes: to deliver the faithful and to annihilate the miscreants. But because the Lord is absolute, His
two different kinds of actions, although apparently different, are ultimately one and the same. His
annihilation of a person like Sisupala is as auspicious as His actions for the protection of the faithful. All
the warriors who fought against Arjuna but who were able to see the lotuslike face of the Lord on the
battlefront achieved the abode of the Lord, exactly as the devotees of the Lord do. The words "pleasing to
the eyes of the seer" are very significant. When the warriors from the other side of the battlefield saw Lord
Krsna at the front, they appreciated His beauty, and their dormant instinct of love of God was awakened.
Sisupala saw the Lord also, but he saw Him as his enemy, and his love was not awakened. Therefore
Sisupala achieved oneness with the Lord by merging in the impersonal glare of His body, called the
brahmajyoti. Others, who were in the marginal position, being neither friends nor enemies but slightly in
love of Godhead by appreciating the beauty of His face, were at once promoted to the spiritual planets, the
Vaikunthas. The Lord's personal abode is called Goloka Vrndavana, and the abodes where His plenary
expansions reside are called the Vaikunthas, where the Lord is present as Narayana. Love of Godhead is
dormant in every living entity, and the entire process of devotional service unto the Lord is meant for
awakening this dormant, eternal love of Godhead. But there are degrees of such transcendental
awakening. Those whose love of God is awakened to the fullest extent go back to the Goloka Vrndavana
planet in the spiritual sky, whereas persons who have just awakened to love of Godhead by accident or
association are transferred to the Vaikuntha planets. Essentially there is no material difference between
Goloka and Vaikuntha, but in the Vaikunthas the Lord is served in unlimited opulence, whereas in
Goloka the Lord is served in natural affection.
This love of God is awakened by the association of pure devotees of the Lord. Here the word parthastraputah
is significant. Those who saw the beautiful face of the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra were
purified first by Arjuna when he made his onslaught with arrows. The Lord appeared for the mission of
diminishing the burden of the world, and Arjuna was assisting the Lord by fighting on His behalf. Arjuna
personally declined to fight, and the whole instruction of the Bhagavad-gita was given to Arjuna to engage
him in the fight. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna agreed to fight in preference to his own decision,
and thus Arjuna fought to assist the Lord in His mission of diminishing the burden of the world. All the
activities of a pure devotee are executed on behalf of the Lord because a pure devotee of the Lord has
nothing to do for his personal interest. Arjuna's killing was as good as killing by the Lord Himself. As
soon as Arjuna shot an arrow at an enemy, that enemy became purified of all material contaminations and
became eligible to be transferred to the spiritual sky. Those warriors who appreciated the lotus feet of the
Lord and saw His face at the front had their dormant love of God awakened, and thus they were
transferred at once to Vaikunthaloka not to the impersonal state of brahmajyoti as was Sisupala. Sisupala
died without appreciating the Lord, while others died with appreciation of the Lord. Both were transferred
to the spiritual sky, but those who awakened to love of God were transferred to the planets of the
transcendental sky.
Uddhava seemingly lamented that his own position was less than that of the warriors on the Battlefield
of Kuruksetra because they had attained to Vaikuntha whereas he remained to lament the disappearance
of the Lord.
