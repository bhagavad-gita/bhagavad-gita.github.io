<h2>Translation</h2>
Doubt, misapprehension, correct apprehension, memory and sleep, as determined by their different
functions, are said to be the distinct characteristics of intelligence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Doubt is one of the important functions of intelligence; blind acceptance of something does not give
evidence of intelligence. Therefore the word samsaya is very important; in order to cultivate intelligence,
one should be doubtful in the beginning. But doubting is not very favorable when information is received
from the proper source. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that doubting the words of the authority is the
cause of destruction.
As described in the Patanjali yoga system, pramana-viparyaya-vikalpa-nidra-smrtyah. By intelligence
only one can understand things as they are. By intelligence only can one understand whether or not he is
the body. The study to determine whether one's identity is spiritual or material begins in doubt. When
one is able to analyze his actual position, the false identification with the body is detected. This is
viparyasa. When false identification is detected, then real identification can be understood. Real
understanding is described here as niscayah, or proved experimental knowledge. This experimental
knowledge can be achieved when one has understood the false knowledge. By experimental or proved
knowledge, one can understand that he is not the body but spirit soul.
Smrti means "memory," and svapa means "sleep." Sleep is also necessary to keep the intelligence in
working order. If there is no sleep, the brain cannot work nicely. In Bhagavad-gita it is especially
mentioned that persons who regulate eating, sleeping and other necessities of the body in the proper
proportion become very successful in the yoga process. These are some of the aspects of the analytical
study of intelligence as described in both the Patanjali yoga system and the Sankhya philosophy system of
Kapiladeva in Srimad-Bhagavatam.
