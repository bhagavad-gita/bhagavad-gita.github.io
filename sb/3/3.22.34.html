<h2>Text</h2>
nisnatam yogamayasu
munim svayambhuvam manum
yad abhramsayitum bhoga
na sekur bhagavat-param
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nisnatam--absorbed; yoga-mayasu--in temporary enjoyment; munim--who was equal to a saint;
svayambhuvam--Svayambhuva; manum--Manu; yat--from which; abhramsayitum--to cause to deviate;
bhogah--material enjoyments; na--not; sekuh--were able; bhagavat-param--who was a great devotee of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus Svayambhuva Manu was a saintly king. Although absorbed in material happiness, he was not
dragged to the lowest grade of life, for he always enjoyed his material happiness in a Krsna conscious
atmosphere.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The kingly happiness of material enjoyment generally drags one to the lowest grade of life, namely
degradation to animal life, because of unrestricted sense enjoyment. But Svayambhuva Manu was
considered as good as a saintly sage because the atmosphere created in his kingdom and home was
completely Krsna conscious. The case is similar with the conditioned souls in general; they have come
into this material life for sense gratification, but if they are able to create a Krsna conscious atmosphere, as
depicted here or as prescribed in revealed scriptures, by temple worship and household Deity worship,
then in spite of their material enjoyment they can make advancement in pure Krsna consciousness
without a doubt. At the present moment, modern civilization is too much attached to the material way of
life, or sense gratification. Therefore, the Krsna consciousness movement can give the people in general
the best opportunity to utilize their human life in the midst of material enjoyment. Krsna consciousness
does not stop them in their propensity for material enjoyment, but simply regulates their habits in the life
of sense enjoyment. In spite of their enjoying the material advantages, they can be liberated in this very
life by practicing Krsna consciousness by the simple method of chanting the holy names of the Lord--Hare
Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.
