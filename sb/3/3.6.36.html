<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In spite of my inability, whatever I have been able to hear [from the spiritual master] and whatever I
could assimilate I am now describing in glorification of the Lord by pure speech, for otherwise my power
of speaking would remain unchaste.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The purification of the conditioned soul necessitates purification of his consciousness. By the presence
of consciousness, the presence of the transcendental soul is verified, and as soon as consciousness leaves
the body, the material body is not active. Consciousness is perceived, therefore, by activities. The theory
put forward by empiric philosophers that consciousness can remain in an inactive state is the proof of
their poor fund of knowledge. One should not become unchaste by stopping the activities of pure
consciousness. If the activities of pure consciousness are stopped, certainly the conscious living force will
be otherwise engaged because unless engaged the consciousness has no standing. Consciousness cannot
be silent, even for a moment. When the body does not act, the consciousness acts in the form of dreams.
Unconsciousness is artificial; by induced extraneous help it remains for a limited period, but when the
intoxication of the drug is finished or when one is awake, the consciousness again acts earnestly.
Maitreya's statement is that in order to avoid unchaste conscious activities, he was trying to describe the
unlimited glories of the Lord, although he did not have the ability to describe them perfectly. This
glorification of the Lord is not a product of research, but the result of hearing submissively from the
authority of the spiritual master. It is also not possible to repeat all that one has heard from his spiritual
master, but one can narrate as far as possible by one's honest endeavor. It does not matter whether the
Lord's glories are fully explained or not. One must attempt to engage one's bodily, mental and verbal
activities in the transcendental glorification of the Lord, otherwise such activities will remain unchaste
and impure. The existence of the conditioned soul can be purified only by the method of engaging mind
and speech in the service of the Lord. The tridandi-sannyasi of the Vaisnava school accepts three rods,
representing the vow to engage in the service of the Lord with body, mind and speech, whereas the
ekadandi-sannyasi takes the vow to become one with the Supreme. Since the Lord is the Absolute, there is
no distinction between Him and His glories. The glories of the Lord as chanted by the Vaisnava sannyasi
are as substantial as the Lord Himself, and thus while glorifying the Lord the devotee becomes one with
Him in transcendental interest, although he remains eternally a transcendental servitor. This
simultaneously one and different position of the devotee makes him eternally purified, and thus his life
becomes a complete success.
