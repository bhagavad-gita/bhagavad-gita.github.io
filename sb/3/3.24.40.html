<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
matra adhyatmikim vidyam
samanim sarva-karmanam
vitarisye yaya casau
bhayam catitarisyati
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
matre--to My mother; adhyatmikim--which opens the door of spiritual life; vidyam--knowledge;
samanim--ending; sarva-karmanam--all fruitive activities; vitarisye--I shall give; yaya--by which; ca--also;
asau--she; bhayam--fear; ca--also; atitarisyati--will overcome.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I shall also describe this sublime knowledge, which is the door to spiritual life, to My mother, so that
she also can attain perfection and self-realization, ending all reactions to fruitive activities. Thus she also
will be freed from all material fear.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni was anxious about his good wife, Devahuti, while leaving home, and so the worthy son
promised that not only would Kardama Muni be freed from the material entanglement, but Devahuti
would also be freed by receiving instruction from her son. A very good example is set here: the husband
goes away, taking the sannyasa order for self-realization, but his representative, the son, who is equally
educated, remains at home to deliver the mother. A sannyasi is not supposed to take his wife with him. At
the vanaprastha stage of retired life, or the stage midway between householder life and renounced life, one
may keep his wife as an assistant without sex relations, but in the sannyasa order of life one cannot keep
his wife with him. Otherwise, a person like Kardama Muni could have kept his wife with him, and there
would have been no hindrance to his prosecution of self-realization.
Kardama Muni followed the Vedic injunction that no one in sannyasa life can have any kind of
relationship with women. But what is the position of a woman who is left by her husband? She is
entrusted to the son, and the son promises that he will deliver his mother from entanglement. A woman is
not supposed to take sannyasa. So-called spiritual societies concocted in modern times give sannyasa even
to women, although there is no sanction in the Vedic literature for a woman's accepting sannyasa.
Otherwise, if it were sanctioned, Kardama Muni could have taken his wife and given her sannyasa. The
woman must remain at home. She has only three stages of life: dependency on the father in childhood,
dependency on the husband in youth and, in old age, dependency on the grown-up son, such as Kapila. In
old age the progress of woman depends on the grown-up son. The ideal son, Kapila Muni, is assuring His
father of the deliverance of His mother so that His father may go peacefully without anxiety for his good
wife.
