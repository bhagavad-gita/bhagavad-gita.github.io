SYNONYMS
tatha eva--likewise; harinaih--by deer; krodaih--by boars; svavit--porcupines; gavaya--a wild animal
closely resembling the cow; kunjaraih--by elephants; gopucchaih--by baboons; haribhih--by lions;
markaih--by monkeys; nakulaih--by mongooses; nabhibhih--by musk deer; vrtam--surrounded.
TRANSLATION
Its shores abounded with deer, boars, porcupines, gavayas, elephants, baboons, lions, monkeys,
mongooses and musk deer.
PURPORT
Musk deer are not found in every forest, but only in places like Bindu-sarovara. They are always
intoxicated by the aroma of musk secreted from their navels. Gavayas, the species of cow mentioned
herein, bear a bunch of hair at the end of their tails. This bunch of hair is used in temple worship to fan
the Deities. Gavayas are sometimes called camaris, and they are considered very sacred. In India there are
still gypsies or forest mercantile people who flourish by trading kasturi, or musk, and the bunches of hair
from the camaris. These are always in great demand for the higher classes of Hindu population, and such
business still goes on in large cities and villages in India.

TRANSLATION
Entering that most sacred spot with his daughter and going near the sage, the first monarch,
Svayambhuva Manu, saw the sage sitting in his hermitage, having just propitiated the sacred fire by
pouring oblations into it. His body shone most brilliantly; though he had engaged in austere penance for a
long time, he was not emaciated, for the Lord had cast His affectionate sidelong glance upon him and he
had also heard the nectar flowing from the moonlike words of the Lord. The sage was tall, his eyes were
large, like the petals of a lotus, and he had matted locks on his head. He was clad in rags. Svayambhuva
Manu approached and saw him to be somewhat soiled, like an unpolished gem.
PURPORT
Here are some descriptions of a brahmacari-yogi. In the morning, the first duty of a brahmacari seeking
spiritual elevation is huta-hutasana, to offer sacrificial oblations to the Supreme Lord. Those engaged in
brahmacarya cannot sleep until seven or nine o'clock in the morning. They must rise early in the
morning, at least one and a half hours before the sun rises, and offer oblations, or in this age, they must
chant the holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna. As referred to by Lord Caitanya, kalau nasty eva nasty eva
nasty eva gatir anyatha: there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative, in this age,
to chanting the holy name of the Lord. The brahmacari must rise early in the morning and, after placing
himself, should chant the holy name of the Lord. From the very features of the sage, it appeared that he
had undergone great austerities; that is the sign of one observing brahmacarya, the vow of celibacy. If one
lives otherwise, it will be manifest in the lust visible in his face and body. The word vidyotamanam
indicates that the brahmacari feature showed in his body. That is the certificate that one has undergone
great austerity in yoga. A drunkard or smoker or sex-monger can never be eligible to practice yoga.
Generally yogis look very skinny because of their not being comfortably situated, but Kardama Muni was
not emaciated, for he had seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. Here the word
snigdhapangavalokanat means that he was fortunate enough to see the Supreme Lord face to face. He
looked healthy because he had directly received the nectarean sound vibrations from the lotus lips of the
Personality of Godhead. Similarly, one who hears the transcendental sound vibration of the holy name of
the Lord, Hare Krsna, also improves in health. We have actually seen that many brahmacaris and
grhasthas connected with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness have improved in health,
and a luster has come to their faces. It is essential that a brahmacari engaged in spiritual advancement
look very healthy and lustrous. The comparison of the sage to an unpolished gem is very appropriate.
Even if a gem just taken from a mine looks unpolished, the luster of the gem cannot be stopped. Similarly,
although Kardama was not properly dressed and his body was not properly cleansed, his overall
appearance was gemlike.
