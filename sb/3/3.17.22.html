<h2>Text</h2>
mano-virya-varotsiktam
asrnyam akuto-bhayam
bhita nililyire devas
tarksya-trasta ivahayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
manah-virya--by mental and bodily strength; vara--by the boon; utsiktam--proud; asrnyam--not able to
be checked; akutah-bhayam--fearing no one; bhitah--frightened; nililyire--hid themselves; devah--the
demigods; tarksya--Garuda; trastah--frightened of; iva--like; ahayah--snakes.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
His mental and bodily strength as well as the boon conferred upon him had made him proud. He feared
death at the hands of no one, and there was no checking him. The gods, therefore, were seized with fear at
his very sight, and they hid themselves even as snakes hide themselves for fear of Garuda.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The asuras are generally strongly built, as described here, and therefore their mental condition is very
sound, and their prowess is also extraordinary. Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu, having received the boon
that they would not be killed by any other living entity within this universe, were almost immortal, and
thus they were completely fearless.
