<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavan svatma-mayaya
gatim tam avalokya sah
sarasvatim upasprsya
vrksa-mulam upavisat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; sva-atma-mayayah--by His internal potency; gatim--the end;
tam--that; avalokya--foreseeing; sah--He (Krsna); sarasvatim--the River Sarasvati; upasprsya--after sipping
water; vrksa-mulam--at the foot of a tree; upavisat--sat down.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, after foreseeing the end [of His family] by His internal
potency, went to the bank of the River Sarasvati, sipped water, and sat down underneath a tree.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All the above-mentioned activities of the Yadus and Bhojas were executed by the internal potency of the
Lord because He wanted them to be dispatched to their respective abodes after He had finished His
mission of descent. They were all His sons and grandsons and were given complete protection by the
paternal affection of the Lord. How they could be vanquished in the presence of the Lord is answered in
this verse: everything was done by the Lord Himself (svatma-mayayah). The Lord's family members were
either incarnations of His plenary expansions or demigods from the heavenly planets, and thus before His
departure He separated them by His internal potency. Before being dispatched to their respective abodes,
they were sent to the holy place of Prabhasa, where they performed pious activities and took food and
drink to their heart's content. It was then arranged for them to be sent back to their abodes so that others
could see that the powerful Yadu dynasty was no longer in the world. In the previous verse, the word
anujnata, indicating that the whole sequence of events was arranged by the Lord, is significant. These
particular pastimes of the Lord are not a manifestation of His external energy, or material nature. Such an
exhibition of His internal potency is eternal, and therefore one should not conclude that the Yadus and
Bhojas died in a drunken state in an ordinary fratricidal war. Sri Jiva Gosvami comments on these
incidents as magical performances.
