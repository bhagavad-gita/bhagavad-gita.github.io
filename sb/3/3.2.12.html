<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord appeared in the mortal world by His internal potency, yoga-maya. He came in His eternal
form, which is just suitable for His pastimes. These pastimes were wonderful for everyone, even for those
proud of their own opulence, including the Lord Himself in His form as the Lord of Vaikuntha. Thus His
[Sri Krsna's] transcendental body is the ornament of all ornaments.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In conformity with the Vedic hymns (nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam), the Personality of Godhead is
more excellent than all other living beings within all the universes in the material world. He is the chief of
all living entities; no one can surpass Him or be equal to Him in wealth, strength, fame, beauty,
knowledge or renunciation. When Lord Krsna was within this universe, He seemed to be a human being
because He appeared in a manner just suitable for His pastimes in the mortal world. He did not appear in
human society in His Vaikuntha feature with four hands because that would not have been suitable for
His pastimes. But in spite of His appearing as a human being, no one was or is equal to Him in any respect
in any of the six different opulences. Everyone is more or less proud of his opulence in this world, but
when Lord Krsna was in human society, He excelled all His contemporaries within the universe.
When the Lord's pastimes are visible to the human eye, they are called prakata, and when they are not
visible they are called aprakata. In fact, the Lord's pastimes never stop, just as the sun never leaves the
sky. The sun is always in its right orbit in the sky, but it is sometimes visible and sometimes invisible to
our limited vision. Similarly, the pastimes of the Lord are always current in one universe or another, and
when Lord Krsna disappeared from the transcendental abode of Dvaraka, it was simply a disappearance
from the eyes of the people there. It should not be misunderstood that His transcendental body, which is
just suitable for the pastimes in the mortal world, is in any way inferior to His different expansions in the
Vaikunthalokas. His body manifested in the material world is transcendental par excellence in the sense
that His pastimes in the mortal world excel His mercy displayed in the Vaikunthalokas. In the
Vaikunthalokas the Lord is merciful toward the liberated or nitya-mukta living entities, but in His
pastimes in the mortal world He is merciful even to the fallen souls who are nitya-baddha, or conditioned
forever. The six excellent opulences which He displayed in the mortal world by the agency of His internal
potency, yoga-maya, are rare even in the Vaikunthalokas. All His pastimes were manifested not by the
material energy but by His spiritual energy. The excellence of His rasa-lila at Vrndavana and His
householder life with sixteen thousand wives is wonderful even for Narayana in Vaikuntha and is
certainly so for other living entities within this mortal world. His pastimes are wonderful even for other
incarnations of the Lord, such as Sri Rama, Nrsimha and Varaha. His opulence was so superexcellent that
His pastimes were adored even by the Lord of Vaikuntha, who is not different from Lord Krsna Himself.
