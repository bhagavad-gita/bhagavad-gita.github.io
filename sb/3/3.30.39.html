<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who aspires to reach the culmination of yoga and has realized his self by rendering service unto Me
should never associate with an attractive woman, for such a woman is declared in the scripture to be the
gateway to hell for the advancing devotee.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The culmination of yoga is full Krsna consciousness. This is affirmed in Bhagavad-gita: a person who is
always thinking of Krsna in devotion is the topmost of all yogis. And in the Second Chapter of the First
Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is also stated that when one becomes freed from material contamination
by rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at that time understand
the science of God.
Here the word pratilabdhatma-labhah occurs. Atma means "self," and labha means "gain." Generally,
conditioned souls have lost their atma, or self, but those who are transcendentalists have realized the self.
It is directed that such a self-realized soul who aspires to the topmost platform of yogic perfection should
not associate with young women. In the modern age, however, there are so many rascals who recommend
that while one has genitals he should enjoy women as much as he likes, and at the same time he can
become a yogi. In no standard yoga system is the association of women accepted. It is clearly stated here
that the association of women is the gateway to hellish life. The association of woman is very much
restricted in the Vedic civilization. Out of the four social divisions, the brahmacari, vanaprastha and the
sannyasi--three orders--are strictly prohibited from the association of women; only the grhasthas, or
householders, are given license to have an intimate relationship with a woman, and that relationship is
also restricted for begetting nice children. If, however, one wants to stick to continued existence in the
material world, he may indulge in female association unrestrictedly.
