<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He secures money by committing violence here and there, and although he employs it in the service of
his family, he himself eats only a little portion of the food thus purchased, and he goes to hell for those for
whom he earned the money in such an irregular way.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is a Bengali proverb, "The person for whom I have stolen accuses me of being a thief." The family
members, for whom an attached person acts in so many criminal ways, are never satisfied. In illusion an
attached person serves such family members, and by serving them he is destined to enter into a hellish
condition of life. For example, a thief steals something to maintain his family, and he is caught and
imprisoned. This is the sum and substance of material existence and attachment to material society,
friendship and love. Although an attached family man is always engaged in getting money by hook or by
crook for the maintenance of his family, he cannot enjoy more than what he could consume even without
such criminal activities. A man who eats eight ounces of foodstuffs may have to maintain a big family and
earn money by any means to support that family, but he himself is not offered more than what he can eat,
and sometimes he eats the remnants that are left after his family members are fed. Even by earning money
by unfair means, he cannot enjoy life for himself. That is called the covering illusion of maya.
The process of illusory service to society, country and community is exactly the same everywhere; the
same principle is applicable even to big national leaders. A national leader who is very great in serving his
country is sometimes killed by his countrymen because of irregular service. In other words, one cannot
satisfy his dependents by this illusory service, although one cannot get out of the service because servant
is his constitutional position. A living entity is constitutionally part and parcel of the Supreme Being, but
he forgets that he has to render service to the Supreme Being and diverts his attention to serving others;
this is called maya. By serving others he falsely thinks that he is master. The head of a family thinks of
himself as the master of the family, or the leader of a nation thinks of himself as the master of the nation,
whereas actually he is serving, and by serving maya he is gradually going to hell. Therefore, a sane man
should come to the point of Krsna consciousness and engage in the service of the Supreme Lord, applying
his whole life, all of his wealth, his entire intelligence and his full power of speaking.
