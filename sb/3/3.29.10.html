karma-nirharam uddisya
parasmin va tad-arpanam
yajed yastavyam iti va
prthag-bhavah sa sattvikah
SYNONYMS
karma--fruitive activities; nirharam--freeing himself from; uddisya--with the purpose of; parasmin--to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; va--or; tat-arpanam--offering the result of activities; yajet--may
worship; yastavyam--to be worshiped; iti--thus; va--or; prthak-bhavah--separatist; sah--he; sattvikah--in
the mode of goodness.
TRANSLATION
When a devotee worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offers the results of his activities in
order to free himself from the inebrieties of fruitive activities, his devotion is in the mode of goodness.
PURPORT
The brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, along with the brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and
sannyasis, are the members of the eight divisions of varnas and asramas, and they have their respective
duties to perform for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When such activities are
performed and the results are offered to the Supreme Lord, they are called karmarpanam, duties
performed for the satisfaction of the Lord. If there is any inebriety or fault, it is atoned for by this offering
process. But if this offering process is in the mode of goodness rather than in pure devotion, then the
interest is different. The four asramas and the four varnas act for some benefit in accordance with their
personal interests. Therefore such activities are in the mode of goodness; they cannot be counted in the
category of pure devotion. Pure devotional service as described by Rupa Gosvami is free from all material
desires. Anyabhilasita-sunyam. There can be no excuse for personal or material interest. Devotional
activities should be transcendental to fruitive activities and empiric philosophical speculation. Pure
devotional service is transcendental to all material qualities.
Devotional service in the modes of ignorance, passion and goodness can be divided into eighty-one
categories. There are different devotional activities, such as hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping,
offering prayer, rendering service and surrendering everything, and each of them can be divided into three
qualitative categories. There is hearing in the mode of passion, in the mode of ignorance and in the mode
of goodness. Similarly, there is chanting in the mode of ignorance, passion and goodness, etc. Three
multiplied by nine equals twenty-seven, and when again multiplied by three it becomes eighty-one. One
has to transcend all such mixed materialistic devotional service in order to reach the standard of pure
devotional service, as explained in the next verses.

residing in everyone's heart; manah-gatih--the heart's course; avicchinna--continuous; yatha--as; ganga--of

causeless; avyavahita--not separated; ya--which; bhaktih--devotional service; purusa-uttame--towards the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
TRANSLATION
The manifestation of unadulterated devotional service is exhibited when one's mind is at once attracted
to hearing the transcendental name and qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is residing
in everyone's heart. Just as the water of the Ganges flows naturally down towards the ocean, such
devotional ecstasy, uninterrupted by any material condition, flows towards the Supreme Lord.
PURPORT
The basic principle of this unadulterated, pure devotional service is love of Godhead. Mad-guna-srutimatrena
means "just after hearing about the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead." These qualities are called nirguna. The Supreme Lord is uncontaminated by the modes of
material nature; therefore He is attractive to the pure devotee. There is no need to practice meditation to
attain such attraction; the pure devotee is already in the transcendental stage, and the affinity between
him and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural and is compared to the Ganges water flowing
towards the sea. The flow of the Ganges water cannot be stopped by any condition; similarly, a pure
devotee's attraction for the transcendental name, form and pastimes of the Supreme Godhead cannot be
stopped by any material condition. The word avicchinna, "without interruptions," is very important in
this connection. No material condition can stop the flow of the devotional service of a pure devotee.
The word ahaituki means "without reason." A pure devotee does not render loving service to the
Personality of Godhead for any cause or for any benefit, material or spiritual. This is the first symptom of
unalloyed devotion. Anyabhilasita-sunyam: he has no desire to fulfill by rendering devotional service.
Such devotional service is meant for the purusottama, the Supreme Personality, and not for anyone else.
Sometimes pseudodevotees show devotion to many demigods, thinking the forms of the demigods to be
the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead's form. It is specifically mentioned herein, however, that
bhakti, devotional service, is meant only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, Visnu, or
Krsna, not for anyone else.
Avyavahita means "without cessation." A pure devotee must engage in the service of the Lord twentyfour
hours a day, without cessation; his life is so molded that at every minute and every second he
engages in some sort of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Another meaning of
the word avyavahita is that the interest of the devotee and the interest of the Supreme Lord are on the
same level. The devotee has no interest but to fulfill the transcendental desire of the Supreme Lord. Such
spontaneous service unto the Supreme Lord is transcendental and is never contaminated by the material
modes of nature. These are the symptoms of pure devotional service, which is free from all contamination
of material nature.
