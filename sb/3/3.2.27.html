<h2>Translation</h2>
In His childhood, the Almighty Lord was surrounded by cowherd boys and calves, and thus He traveled
on the shore of the Yamuna River, through gardens densely covered with trees and filled with vibrations
of chirping birds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Nanda Maharaja was a landholder for King Kamsa, but because by caste he was a vaisya, a member of
the mercantile and agricultural community, he maintained thousands of cows. It is the duty of the vaisyas
to give protection to the cows, just as the ksatriyas are to give protection to the human beings. Because
the Lord was a child, He was put in charge of the calves with His cowherd boy friends. These cowherd
boys were great rsis and yogis in their previous births, and after many such pious births, they gained the
association of the Lord and could play with Him on equal terms. Such cowherd boys never cared to know
who Krsna was, but they played with Him as a most intimate and lovable friend. They were so fond of the
Lord that at night they would only think of the next morning when they would be able to meet the Lord
and go together to the forests for cowherding.
The forests on the shore of the Yamuna are all beautiful gardens full of trees of mango, jackfruit, apples,
guava, oranges, grapes, berries, palmfruit and so many other plants and fragrant flowers. And because the
forest was on the bank of the Yamuna, naturally there were ducks, cranes and peacocks on the branches
of the trees. All these trees and birds and beasts were pious living entities born in the transcendental
abode of Vrndavana just to give pleasure to the Lord and His eternal associates, the cowherd boys.
While playing like a small child with His associates, the Lord killed many demons, including Aghasura,
Bakasura, Pralambasura and Gardabhasura. Although He appeared at Vrndavana just as a boy, He was
actually like the covered flames of a fire. As a small particle of fire can kindle a great fire with fuel, so the
Lord killed all these great demons, beginning from His babyhood in the house of Nanda Maharaja. The
land of Vrndavana, the Lord's childhood playground, still remains today, and anyone who visits these
places enjoys the same transcendental bliss, although the Lord is not physically visible to our imperfect
eyes. Lord Caitanya recommended this land of the Lord as identical with the Lord and therefore
worshipable by the devotees. This instruction is taken up especially by the followers of Lord Caitanya
known as the Gaudiya Vaisnavas. And because the land is identical with the Lord, devotees like Uddhava
and Vidura visited these places five thousand years ago in order to have direct contact with the Lord,
visible or not visible, Thousands of devotees of the Lord are still wandering in these sacred places of
Vrndavana, and all of them are preparing themselves to go back home, back to Godhead.
