<h2>Text</h2>
ye mayaya te hata-medhasas tvatpadaravindam
bhava-sindhu-potam
upasate kama-lavaya tesam
rasisa kaman niraye 'pi ye syuh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ye--those persons; mayaya--by the deluding energy; te--of You; hata--has been lost; medhasah--whose
intelligence; tvat--Your; pada-aravindam--lotus feet; bhava--of mundane existence; sindhu--the ocean;
potam--the boat for crossing; upasate--worship; kama-lavaya--for obtaining trivial pleasures; tesam--their;
rasi--You bestow; isa--O Lord; kaman--desires; niraye--in hell; api--even; ye--which desires; syuh--can be
available.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Your lotus feet are the true vessel to take one across the ocean of mundane nescience. Only persons
deprived of their intelligence by the spell of the deluding energy will worship those feet with a view to
attain the trivial and momentary pleasures of the senses, which even persons rotting in hell can attain.
However, O my Lord, You are so kind that You bestow mercy even upon them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter, there are two kinds of devotees--those who desire material
pleasures and those who desire nothing but service to the Lord. Material pleasures can be attained even by
hogs and dogs, whose condition of life is hellish. The hog also eats, sleeps and enjoys sex life to the full
extent, and it is also very satisfied with such hellish enjoyment of material existence. Modern yogis advise
that because one has senses, one must enjoy to the fullest extent like cats and dogs, yet one can go on and
practice yoga. This is condemned here by Kardama Muni; he says that such material pleasures are
available for cats and dogs in a hellish condition. The Lord is so kind that if so-called yogis are satisfied by
hellish pleasures, He can give them facilities to attain all the material pleasures they desire, but they
cannot attain the perfectional stage attained by Kardama Muni.
Hellish and demoniac persons do not actually know what is the ultimate attainment in perfection, and
therefore they think that sense gratification is the highest goal of life. They advise that one can satisfy the
senses and at the same time, by reciting some mantra and by some practice, can cheaply aspire for
perfection. Such persons are described here as hata-medhasah, which means "those whose brains are
spoiled." They aspire for material enjoyment by perfection of yoga or meditation. In Bhagavad-gita it is
stated by the Lord that the intelligence of those who worship the demigods has been spoiled. Similarly,
here too it is stated by Kardama Muni that one who aspires after material enjoyment by practice of yoga
has spoiled his brain substance and is fool number one. Actually, the intelligent practitioner of yoga
should aspire for nothing else but to cross over the ocean of nescience by worshiping the Personality of
Godhead and to see the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even today persons
whose brain substance is spoiled are given the benediction to become cats, dogs or hogs and enjoy
material happiness from sex life and sense gratification. The Lord confirms this benediction in Bhagavadgita:
"Whatever a person aspires to receive from Me, I offer him as he desires."
