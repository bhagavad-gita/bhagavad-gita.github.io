<h2>Text</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca
ma veda-garbha gas tandrim
sarga udyamam avaha
tan mayapaditam hy agre
yan mam prarthayate bhavan
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Lord, the Personality of Godhead, said; ma--do not; veda-garbha--O You who
have the depth of all Vedic wisdom; gah tandrim--become dejected; sarge--for creation; udyamam--
enterprises; avaha--you just undertake; tat--that (which you want); maya--by Me; apaditam--executed; hi--
certainly; agre--previously; yat--which; mam--from Me; prarthayate--begging; bhavan--you.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead then said: O Brahma, O depth of Vedic wisdom, be neither
depressed nor anxious about the execution of creation. What you are begging from Me has already been
granted before.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Any person authorized by either the Lord or by His bona fide representative is already blessed, as is the
work entrusted to him. Of course, the person entrusted with such a responsibility should always be aware
of his incapability and must always look for the mercy of the Lord for the successful execution of his duty.
One should not be puffed up because he is entrusted with certain executive work. Fortunate is he who is
so entrusted, and if he is always fixed in the sense of being subordinate to the will of the Supreme, he is
sure to come out successful in the discharge of his work. Arjuna was entrusted with the work of fighting
on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, and before he was so entrusted, the Lord had already arranged for his
victory. But Arjuna was always conscious of his position as subordinate to the Lord, and thus he accepted
Him as the supreme guide in his responsibility. Anyone who takes pride in doing responsible work but
does not give credit to the Supreme Lord is certainly falsely proud and cannot execute anything nicely.
Brahma and persons in the line of his disciplic succession who follow in his footsteps are always
successful in the discharge of loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord.
