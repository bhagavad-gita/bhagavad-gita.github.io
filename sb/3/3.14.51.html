amodata ditir bhrsam
putrayos ca vadham krsnad

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--the sage Maitreya said; srutva--by hearing; bhagavatam--to be a great devotee of the
Lord; pautram--grandson; amodata--took pleasure; ditih--Diti; bhrsam--very greatly; putrayoh--of two
sons; ca--also; vadham--the killing; krsnat--by Krsna; viditva--knowing this; asit--became; maha-manah--
highly pleased in mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sage Maitreya said: Hearing that her grandson would be a great devotee and that her sons would be
killed by Krsna, Diti was highly pleased in mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Diti was very aggrieved to learn that because of her untimely pregnancy her sons would be demons and
would fight with the Lord. But when she heard that her grandson would be a great devotee and that her
two sons would be killed by the Lord, she was very satisfied. As the wife of a great sage and the daughter
of a great Prajapati, Daksa, she knew that being killed by the Personality of Godhead is a great fortune.
Since the Lord is absolute, His acts of violence and nonviolence are both on the absolute platform. There
is no difference in such acts of the Lord. Mundane violence and nonviolence have nothing to do with the
Lord's acts. A demon killed by Him attains the same result as one who attains liberation after many, many
births of penance and austerity. The word bhrsam is significant herein because it indicates that Diti was
pleased beyond her expectations.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Pregnancy of Diti in the Evening."
