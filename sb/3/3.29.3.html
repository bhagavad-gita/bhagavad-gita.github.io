<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
yad adhruvasya dehasya
sanubandhasya durmatih
dhruvani manyate mohad
grha-ksetra-vasuni ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--because; adhruvasya--temporary; dehasya--of the body; sa-anubandhasya--with that which is
related; durmatih--a misguided person; dhruvani--permanent; manyate--thinks; mohat--because of
ignorance; grha--home; ksetra--land; vasuni--wealth; ca--and.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The misguided materialist does not know that his very body is impermanent and that the attractions of
home, land and wealth, which are in relationship to that body, are also temporary. Out of ignorance only,
he thinks that everything is permanent.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The materialist thinks that persons engaged in Krsna consciousness are crazy fellows wasting time by
chanting Hare Krsna, but actually he does not know that he himself is in the darkest region of craziness
because of accepting his body as permanent. And, in relation to his body, he accepts his home, his
country, his society and all other paraphernalia as permanent. This materialistic acceptance of the
permanency of home, land, etc., is called the illusion of maya. This is clearly mentioned here. Mohad
grha-ksetra-vasuni: out of illusion only does the materialist accept his home, his land and his money as
permanent. Out of this illusion, the family life, national life and economic development, which are very
important factors in modern civilization, have grown. A Krsna conscious person knows that this
economic development of human society is but temporary illusion.
In another part of Srimad-Bhagavatam, the acceptance of the body as oneself, the acceptance of others as
kinsmen in relationship to this body and the acceptance of the land of one's birth as worshipable are
declared to be the products of an animal civilization. When, however, one is enlightened in Krsna
consciousness, he can use these for the service of the Lord. That is a very suitable proposition. Everything
has a relationship with Krsna. When all economic development and material advancement are utilized to
advance the cause of Krsna consciousness, a new phase of progressive life arises.
