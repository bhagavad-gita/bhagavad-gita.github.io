<h2>Text</h2>
para-cchandam na vidusa
pusyamano janena sah
anabhipretam apannah
pratyakhyatum anisvarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
para-chandam--the desire of another; na--not; vidusa--understanding; pusyamanah--being maintained;
janena--by persons; sah--he; anabhipretam--into undesirable circumstances; apannah--fallen;
pratyakhyatum--to refuse; anisvarah--unable.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After coming out of the abdomen, the child is given to the care of persons who are unable to understand
what he wants, and thus he is nursed by such persons. Unable to refuse whatever is given to him, he falls
into undesirable circumstances.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Within the abdomen of the mother, the nourishment of the child was being carried on by nature's own
arrangement. The atmosphere within the abdomen was not at all pleasing, but as far as the child's feeding
was concerned, it was being properly done by the laws of nature. But upon coming out of the abdomen
the child falls into a different atmosphere. He wants to eat one thing, but something else is given to him
because no one knows his actual demand, and he cannot refuse the undesirables given to him. Sometimes
the child cries for the mother's breast, but because the nurse thinks that it is due to pain within his
stomach that he is crying, she supplies him some bitter medicine. The child does not want it, but he
cannot refuse it. He is put in very awkward circumstances, and the suffering continues.
