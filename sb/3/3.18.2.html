<h2>Text</h2>

<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dadarsa--he saw; tatra--there; abhijitam--the victorious; dhara--the earth; dharam--bearing;
pronniyamana--being raised upward; avanim--the earth; agra-damstraya--by the tip of His tusk;
musnantam--who was diminishing; aksna--with His eyes; sva-rucah--Hiranyaksa's own splendor; aruna--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He saw there the all-powerful Personality of Godhead in His boar incarnation, bearing the earth upward
on the ends of His tusks and robbing him of his splendor with His reddish eyes. The demon laughed: Oh,
an amphibious beast!
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In a previous chapter we have discussed the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
Varaha, the boar. While Varaha, with His tusks, engaged in uplifting the submerged earth from the depths
of the waters, this great demon Hiranyaksa met Him and challenged Him, calling Him a beast. Demons
cannot understand the incarnations of the Lord; they think that His incarnations as a fish or boar or
tortoise are big beasts only. They misunderstand the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even in
His human form, and they deride His descent. In the Caitanya-sampradaya there is sometimes a demoniac
misconception about the descent of Nityananda Prabhu. Nityananda Prabhu's body is spiritual, but
demoniac persons consider the body of the Supreme Personality to be material, just like ours. Avajananti
mam mudhah: persons who have no intelligence deride the transcendental form of the Lord as material.
