<h2>Translation</h2>
The ladies in the Vaikuntha planets are as beautiful as the goddess of fortune herself. Such
transcendentally beautiful ladies, their hands playing with lotuses and their leg bangles tinkling, are
sometimes seen sweeping the marble walls, which are bedecked at intervals with golden borders, in order
to receive the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Supreme Lord, Govinda, is always served in His abode by
many, many millions of goddesses of fortune. Laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam. These
millions and trillions of goddesses of fortune who reside in the Vaikuntha planets are not exactly consorts
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but are the wives of the devotees of the Lord and also engage in
the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated here that in the Vaikuntha planets the
houses are made of marble. Similarly, in the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the ground on the Vaikuntha
planets is made of touchstone. Thus there is no need to sweep the stone in Vaikuntha, for there is hardly
any dust on it, but still, in order to satisfy the Lord, the ladies there always engage in dusting the marble
walls. Why? The reason is that they are eager to achieve the grace of the Lord by doing so.
It is also stated here that in the Vaikuntha planets the goddesses of fortune are faultless. Generally the
goddess of fortune does not remain steadily in one place. Her name is Cancala, which means "one who is
not steady." We find, therefore, that a man who is very rich may become the poorest of the poor. Another
example is Ravana. Ravana took away Laksmi, Sitaji, to his kingdom, and instead of being happy by the
grace of Laksmi, his family and his kingdom were vanquished. Thus Laksmi in the house of Ravana is
Cancala, or unsteady. Men of Ravana's class want Laksmi only, without her husband, Narayana; therefore
they become unsteady due to Laksmiji. Materialistic persons find fault on the part of Laksmi, but in
Vaikuntha Laksmiji is fixed in the service of the Lord. In spite of her being the goddess of fortune, she
cannot be happy without the grace of the Lord. Even the goddess of fortune needs the Lord's grace in
order to be happy, yet in the material world even Brahma, the highest created being, seeks the favor of
Laksmi for happiness.
