<h2>Translation</h2>
By practicing the process of pranayama, one can eradicate the contamination of his physiological
condition, and by concentrating the mind one can become free from all sinful activities. By restraining the
senses one can free himself from material association, and by meditating on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead one can become free from the three modes of material attachment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Ayur-vedic medical science the three items kapha, pitta and vayu (phlegm, bile and air)
maintain the physiological condition of the body. Modern medical science does not accept this
physiological analysis as valid, but the ancient Ayur-vedic process of treatment is based upon these items.
Ayur-vedic treatment concerns itself with the cause of these three elements, which are mentioned in many
places in the Bhagavatam as the basic conditions of the body. Here it is recommended that by practicing
the breathing process of pranayama one can be released from contamination created by the principal
physiological elements, by concentrating the mind one can become free from sinful activities, and by
withdrawing the senses one can free himself from material association.
Ultimately, one has to meditate on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to be elevated to the
transcendental position where he is no longer affected by the three modes of material nature. It is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita that one who engages himself in unalloyed devotional service at once
becomes transcendental to the three modes of material nature and immediately realizes his identification
with Brahman. Sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate. For every item in the yoga system there
is a parallel activity in bhakti-yoga, but the practice of bhakti-yoga is easier for this age. What was
introduced by Lord Caitanya is not a new interpretation. Bhakti-yoga is a feasible process that begins with
chanting and hearing. Bhakti-yoga and other yogas have as their ultimate goal the same Personality of
Godhead, but one is practical, and the others are difficult. One has to purify his physiological condition
by concentration and by restraint of the senses; then he can fix his mind upon the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. That is called samadhi.
