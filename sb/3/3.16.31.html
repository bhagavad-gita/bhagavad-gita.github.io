<h2>Text</h2>
mayi samrambha-yogena
nistirya brahma-helanam
pratyesyatam nikasam me
kalenalpiyasa punah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mayi--unto Me; samrambha-yogena--by practice of mystic yoga in anger; nistirya--being liberated from;
brahma-helanam--the result of disobedience to the brahmanas; pratyesyatam--will come back; nikasam--
near; me--Me; kalena--in due course of time; alpiyasa--very short; punah--again.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord assured the two Vaikuntha inhabitants, Jaya and Vijaya: By practicing the mystic yoga system
in anger, you will be cleansed of the sin of disobeying the brahmanas and within a very short time return
to Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead advised the two doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, that by dint of
bhakti-yoga in anger they would be delivered from the curses of the brahmanas. Srila Madhva Muni
remarks in this connection that by practicing bhakti-yoga one can become free from all sinful reactions.
Even a brahma-sapa, or curse by a brahmana, which cannot be overcome by any other means, can be
overcome by bhakti-yoga.
One can practice bhakti-yoga in many rasas. There are twelve rasas, five primary and seven secondary.
The five primary rasas constitute direct bhakti-yoga, but although the seven secondary rasas are indirect,
they are also counted within bhakti-yoga if they are used in the service of the Lord. In other words,
bhakti-yoga is all-inclusive. If one somehow or other becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he becomes engaged in bhakti-yoga, as described in Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.29.15): kamam
krodham bhayam. The gopis were attracted to Krsna by bhakti-yoga in a relationship of lusty desire
(kama). Similarly, Kamsa was attached to bhakti-yoga by dint of fear of his death. Thus bhakti-yoga is so
powerful that even becoming an enemy of the Lord and always thinking of Him can deliver one very
quickly. It is said, visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva asuras tad-vipanyayah: "Devotees of Lord Visnu are called
demigods, whereas nondevotees are called asuras." But bhakti-yoga is so powerful that both demigods and
asuras can derive its benefits if they always think of the personality of Godhead. The basic principle of
bhakti-yoga is to think of the Supreme Lord always. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.65), man-mana
bhava mad-bhaktah: "Always think of Me." It doesn't matter which way one thinks; the very thought of
the Personality of Godhead is the basic principle of bhakti-yoga.
In the material planets there are different grades of sinful activities, of which disrespecting a brahmana
or a Vaisnava is the most sinful. Here it is clearly stated that one can overcome even that grave sin simply
by thinking of Visnu, not even favorably but in anger. Thus even if those who are not devotees always
think of Visnu, they become free from all sinful activities. Krsna consciousness is the highest form of
thought. Lord Visnu is thought of in this age by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare
Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. From the statements of the Bhagavatam it appears
that if one thinks of Krsna, even as an enemy, that particular qualification--thinking of Visnu, or Krsna--
cleanses one of all sins.
