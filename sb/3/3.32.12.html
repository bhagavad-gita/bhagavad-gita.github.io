<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapila, after instructing His beloved mother,
took permission from her and left His home, His mission having been fulfilled.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The mission of the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of Kapila was to
distribute the transcendental knowledge of Sankhya philosophy, which is full of devotional service.
Having imparted that knowledge to His mother--and, through His mother, to the world--Kapiladeva had
no more need to stay at home, so He took permission from His mother and left. Apparently He left home
for spiritual realization, although He had nothing to realize spiritually because He Himself is the person to
be spiritually realized. Therefore this is an example set by the Supreme Personality of Godhead while
acting like an ordinary human being so that others might learn from Him. He could, of course, have
stayed with His mother, but He indicated that there was no need to stay with the family. It is best to
remain alone as a brahmacari, sannyasi or vanaprastha and cultivate Krsna consciousness throughout
one's whole life. Those who are unable to remain alone are given license to live in household life with wife
and children, not for sense gratification but for cultivation of Krsna consciousness.
