<h2>Text</h2>
tayoh samvadatoh suta
pravrtta hy amalah kathah
apo ganga ivagha-ghnir
hareh padambujasrayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tayoh--while the two (Maitreya and Vidura); samvadatoh--were conversing; suta--O Suta; pravrttah--
arose; hi--certainly; amalah--spotless; kathah--narrations; apah--waters; gangah--of the River Ganges; iva--
like; agha-ghnih--vanquishing all sins; hareh--of the Lord; pada-ambuja--the lotus feet; asrayah--taking
shelter.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka inquired about the conversation between Vidura and Maitreya: There must have been many
narrations of the spotless pastimes of the Lord. The hearing of such narrations is exactly like bathing in
the water of the Ganges, for it can free one from all sinful reactions.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The water of the Ganges is purified because it pours forth from the lotus feet of the Lord. Similarly,
Bhagavad-gita is as good as the water of the Ganges because it is spoken from the mouth of the Supreme
Lord. So it is with any topic on the pastimes of the Lord or the characteristics of His transcendental
activities. The Lord is absolute; there is no difference between His words, His perspiration or His
pastimes. The water of the Ganges, the narrations of His pastimes and the words spoken by Him are all on
the absolute platform, and thus taking shelter of any one of them is equally good. Srila Rupa Gosvami has
enunciated that anything in relationship with Krsna is on the transcendental platform. If we can dovetail
all our activities in relationship with Krsna, then we do not stand on the material platform, but always on
the spiritual platform.
