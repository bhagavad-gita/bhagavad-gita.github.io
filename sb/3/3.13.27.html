<h2>Translation</h2>
Before entering the water to rescue the earth, Lord Boar flew in the sky, slashing His tail, His hard hairs
quivering. His very glance was luminous, and He scattered the clouds in the sky with His hooves and His
glittering white tusks.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When the Lord is offered prayers by His devotees, His transcendental activities are described. Here are
some of the transcendental features of Lord Boar. As the residents of the upper three planetary systems
offered their prayers to the Lord, it is understood that His body expanded throughout the sky, beginning
from the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka. It is stated in the Brahma-samhita that His eyes are
the sun and the moon; therefore His very glance over the sky was as illuminating as the sun or the moon.
The Lord is described herein as mahidhrah, which means either a "big mountain" or the "sustainer of the
earth." In other words, the Lord's body was as big and hard as the Himalayan Mountains; otherwise how
was it possible that He kept the entire earth on the support of His white tusks? The poet Jayadeva, a great
devotee of the Lord, has sung of the incident in his prayers for the incarnations:
vasati dasana-sikhare dharani tava lagna
sasini kalanka-kaleva nimagna
kesava dhrta-sukara-rupa jaya jagadisa hare
"All glories to Lord Kesava [Krsna], who appeared as the boar. The earth was held between His tusks,
which appeared like the scars on the moon."
