TRANSLATION
The King inquired: At the end of the pastimes of the Lord of the three worlds, Sri Krsna, and after the
disappearance of the members of the Vrsni and Bhoja dynasties, who were the best of the great
commanders, why did Uddhava alone remain?
PURPORT
According to Sri Jiva Gosvami, nidhanam means the transcendental abode of the Lord. Ni means the
highest, and dhanam means opulence. And because the abode of the Lord is the highest manifestation of
transcendental opulence, His abode can therefore be called nidhanam. Apart from the grammatical
elucidation, the real purpose of the word nidhanam is to indicate that all the members of the Vrsni and
Bhoja dynasties were direct associates of the Lord, and after the end of His pastimes, all the associates
were dispatched to their respective positions in the transcendental abode.
Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura elucidates the meaning of akrtim as pastimes. A means complete,
and krtim means transcendental pastimes. Since the Lord is identical with His transcendental body, there
is no question of His changing or quitting His body. To act in accordance with the rules and customs of
the material world, the Lord seems to take His birth or leave His body, but the pure devotees of the Lord
know well the actual fact. It is necessary, therefore, for the serious students of Srimad-Bhagavatam to
follow the notes and comments of the great acaryas like Jiva Gosvami and Visvanatha Cakravarti. To
others, who are not devotees of the Lord, the comments and explanations of such acaryas may appear to
he grammatical jugglery, but to the students who are in the line of disciplic succession, the explanations
of the great acaryas are quite fit.
The word upagatesu is also significant. All the members of Vrsni and Bhoja directly reached the abode
of the Lord. Other devotees do not reach the abode of the Lord directly, but the pure associates of the
Lord have no attraction for the opulence of any planets of the material world. Sometimes, due to
inquisitiveness, devotees who are to be promoted to the abode of the Lord have some attraction for the
opulence of the higher material planets above the earth, and thus they desire to see them while going up
to the perfection. But the Vrsnis and Bhojas were directly dispatched because they had no attraction for
material planets. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also suggests that according to the Amara-kosa
dictionary, akrti also means "signal." Lord Krsna ordered Uddhava by signal to go to Badarikasrama after
His departure, and Uddhava, as a pure devotee of the Lord, carried out the order more faithfully than
going back to Godhead, or the abode of the Lord. That was the cause of his remaining alone even after the
departure of the Lord from the face of the earth.
