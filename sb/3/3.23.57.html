<h2>Text</h2>
saham bhagavato nunam
vancita mayaya drdham
yat tvam vimuktidam prapya
na mumukseya bandhanat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa--that very person; aham--I am; bhagavatah--of the Lord; nunam--surely; vancita--cheated; mayaya--by
the illusory energy; drdham--solidly; yat--because; tvam--you; vimukti-dam--who gives liberation;
prapya--having attained; na mumukseya--I have not sought liberation; bandhanat--from material bondage.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My lord, surely I have been solidly cheated by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, for in spite of having obtained your association, which gives liberation from
material bondage, I did not seek such liberation.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
An intelligent man should utilize good opportunities. The first opportunity is the human form of life,
and the second opportunity is to take birth in a suitable family where there is cultivation of spiritual
knowledge; this is rarely obtained. The greatest opportunity is to have the association of a saintly person.
Devahuti was conscious that she was born as the daughter of an emperor. She was sufficiently educated
and cultured, and at last she got Kardama Muni, a saintly person and a great yogi, as her husband. Still, if
she did not get liberation from the entanglement of material energy, then certainly she would be cheated
by the insurmountable illusory energy. Actually, the illusory, material energy is cheating everyone. People
do not know what they are doing when they worship the material energy in the form of goddess Kali or
Durga for material boons. They ask, "Mother, give me great riches, give me a good wife, give me fame,
give me victory." But such devotees of the goddess Maya, or Durga, do not know that they are being
cheated by that goddess. Material achievement is actually no achievement because as soon as one is
illusioned by the material gifts, he becomes more and more entangled, and there is no question of
liberation. One should be intelligent enough to know how to utilize material assets for the purpose of
spiritual realization. That is called karma-yoga or jnana-yoga. Whatever we have we should use as service
to the Supreme Person. It is advised in Bhagavad-gita sva-karmana tam abhyarcya: one should try to
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead by one's assets. There are many forms of service to the
Supreme Lord, and anyone can render service unto Him according to the best of his ability.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Devahuti's Lamentation."
Chapter Twenty-four
The Renunciation of Kardama Muni
