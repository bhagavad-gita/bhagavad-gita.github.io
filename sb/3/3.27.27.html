<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
yadaivam adhyatma-ratah
kalena bahu-janmana
sarvatra jata-vairagya
abrahma-bhuvanan munih
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yada--when; evam--thus; adhyatma-ratah--engaged in self-realization; kalena--for many years; bahujanmana--
for many births; sarvatra--everywhere; jata-vairagyah--detachment is born; a-brahma-bhuvanat--
up to Brahmaloka; munih--a thoughtful person.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When a person thus engages in devotional service and self-realization for many, many years and births,
he becomes completely reluctant to enjoy any one of the material planets, even up to the highest planet,
which is known as Brahmaloka; he becomes fully developed in consciousness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Anyone engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as a devotee,
but there is a distinction between pure devotees and mixed devotees. A mixed devotee engages in
devotional service for the spiritual benefit of being eternally engaged in the transcendental abode of the
Lord in full bliss and knowledge. In material existence, when a devotee is not completely purified, he
expects material benefit from the Lord in the form of relief from material miseries, or he wants material
gain, advancement in knowledge of the relationship between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the
living entity, or knowledge as to the real nature of the Supreme Lord. When a person is transcendental to
these conditions, he is called a pure devotee. He does not engage himself in the service of the Lord for any
material benefit or for understanding of the Supreme Lord. His one interest is that he loves the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, and he spontaneously engages in satisfying Him.
The highest example of pure devotional service is that of the gopis in Vrndavana. They are not
interested in understanding Krsna, but only in loving Him. That platform of love is the pure state of
devotional service. Unless one is advanced to this pure state of devotional service, there is a tendency to
desire elevation to a higher material position. A mixed devotee may desire to enjoy a comfortable life on
another planet with a greater span of life, such as on Brahmaloka. These are material desires, but because
a mixed devotee engages in the service of the Lord, ultimately, after many, many lives of material
enjoyment, he undoubtedly develops Krsna consciousness, and the symptom of this Krsna consciousness
is that he is no longer interested in any sort of materially elevated life. He does not even aspire to become
a personality like Lord Brahma.
