<h2>Translation</h2>
The pure devotee should execute devotional service by giving the greatest respect to the spiritual master
and the acaryas. He should be compassionate to the poor and make friendship with persons who are his
equals, but all his activities should be executed under regulation and with control of the senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita, Thirteenth Chapter, it is clearly stated that one should execute devotional service and
advance on the path of spiritual knowledge by accepting the acarya. Acaryopasanam: one should worship
an acarya, a spiritual master who knows things as they are. The spiritual master must be in the disciplic
succession from Krsna. The predecessors of the spiritual master are his spiritual master, his grand
spiritual master, his great-grand spiritual master and so on, who form the disciplic succession of acaryas.
It is recommended herewith that all the acaryas be given the highest respect. It is stated, gurusu naramatih.
Gurusu means "unto the acaryas," and nara-matih means "thinking like a common man." To think
of the Vaisnavas, the devotees, as belonging to a particular caste or community, to think of the acaryas as
ordinary men or to think of the Deity in the temple as being made of stone, wood or metal, is condemned.
Niyamena: one should offer the greatest respect to the acaryas according to the standard regulations. A
devotee should also be compassionate to the poor. This does not refer to those who are poverty-stricken
materially. According to devotional vision, a man is poor if he is not in Krsna consciousness. A man may
be very rich materially, but if he is not Krsna conscious, he is considered poor. On the other hand, many
acaryas, such as Rupa Gosvami and Sanatana Gosvami, used to live beneath trees every night. Superficially
it appeared that they were poverty-stricken, but from their writings we can understand that in spiritual
life they were the richest personalities.
A devotee shows compassion to those poor souls who are wanting in spiritual knowledge by
enlightening them in order to elevate them to Krsna consciousness. That is one of the duties of a devotee.
He should also make friendship with persons who are on an equal level with himself or who have the
same understanding that he does. For a devotee, there is no point in making friendships with ordinary
persons; he should make friendship with other devotees so that by discussing among themselves, they
may elevate one another on the path of spiritual understanding. This is called ista-gosthi.
In Bhagavad-gita there is reference to bodhayantah parasparam, "discussing among themselves."
Generally pure devotees utilize their valuable time in chanting and discussing various activities of Lord
Krsna or Lord Caitanya amongst themselves. There are innumerable books, such as the puranas,
Mahabharata, Bhagavatam, Bhagavad-gita and Upanisads, which contain countless subjects for discussion
among two devotees or more. Friendship should be cemented between persons with mutual interests and
understanding. Such persons are said to be sva jati, "of the same caste." The devotee should avoid a
person whose character is not fixed in the standard understanding; even though he may be a Vaisnava, or
a devotee of Krsna, if his character is not correctly representative, then he should be avoided. One should
steadily control the senses and the mind and strictly follow the rules and regulations, and he should make
friendship with persons of the same standard.
