<h2>Text</h2>
vibhajya navadhatmanam
manavim suratotsukam
ramam niramayan reme
varsa-pugan muhurtavat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vibhajya--having divided; nava-dha--into nine; atmanam--himself; manavim--the daughter of Manu
(Devahuti); surata--for sex life; utsukam--who was eager; ramam--to his wife; niramayan--giving pleasure;
reme--he enjoyed; varsa-pugan--for many years; muhurtavat--like a moment.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After coming back to his hermitage, he divided himself into nine personalities just to give pleasure to
Devahuti, the daughter of Manu, who was eager for sex life. In that way he enjoyed with her for many,
many years, which passed just like a moment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, Devahuti, is described as suratotsuka. After traveling with her
husband all over the universe, in Mount Meru and the beautiful gardens of the heavenly kingdoms, she
naturally became sexually stimulated, and in order to satisfy her sexual desire, Kardama Muni expanded
himself into nine forms. Instead of one, he became nine, and nine persons had sexual intercourse with
Devahuti for many, many years. It is understood that the sexual appetite of a woman is nine times greater
than that of a man. That is clearly indicated here. Otherwise, Kardama Muni would have had no reason to
expand himself into nine. Here is another example of yogic power. As the Supreme Personality of
Godhead can expand Himself in millions of forms, a yogi can also expand up to nine forms, but not more
than that. Another example is that of Saubhari Muni; he also expanded himself into eight forms. But
however powerful a yogi may be, he cannot expand himself into more than eight or nine forms. The
Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, can expand Himself into millions of forms, ananta-rupa--
innumerable, countless forms--as stated in the Brahma-samhita. No one can compare to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead by any conceivable energetic manifestation of power.
