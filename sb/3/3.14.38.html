<h2>Text</h2>
kasyapa uvaca
aprayatyad atmanas te
dosan mauhurtikad uta
man-nidesaticarena
devanam catihelanat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kasyapah uvaca--the learned brahmana Kasyapa said; aprayatyat--because of the pollution; atmanah--of
the mind; te--your; dosat--because of defilement; mauhurtikat--in terms of the moment; uta--also; mat--
my; nidesa--direction; aticarena--being too neglectful; devanam--of the demigods; ca--also; atihelanat--
being too apathetic.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The learned Kasyapa said: Because of your mind's being polluted, because of defilement of the particular
time, because of your negligence of my directions, and because of your being apathetic to the demigods,
everything was inauspicious.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conditions for having good progeny in society are that the husband should be disciplined in
religious and regulative principles and the wife should be faithful to the husband. In Bhagavad-gita (7.11)
it is said that sexual intercourse according to religious principles is a representation of Krsna
consciousness. Before engaging in sexual intercourse, both the husband and the wife must consider their
mental condition, the particular time, the husband's direction, and obedience to the demigods. According
to Vedic society, there is a suitable auspicious time for sex life, which is called the time for garbhadhana.
Diti neglected all the principles of scriptural injunction, and therefore, although she was very anxious for
auspicious children, she was informed that her children would not be worthy to be the sons of a
brahmana. There is a clear indication herein that a brahmana's son is not always a brahmana. Personalities
like Ravana and Hiranyakasipu were actually born of brahmanas, but they were not accepted as
brahmanas because their fathers did not follow the regulative principles for their birth. Such children are
called demons, or Raksasas. There were only one or two Raksasas in the previous ages due to negligence
of the disciplinary methods, but during the age of Kali there is no discipline in sex life. How, then, can
one expect good children? Certainly unwanted children cannot be a source of happiness in society, but
through the Krsna consciousness movement they can be raised to the human standard by chanting the
holy name of God. That is the unique contribution of Lord Caitanya to human society.
