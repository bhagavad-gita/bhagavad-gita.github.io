<h2>Translation</h2>
He was adorned with a girdle that shone brightly on the yellow cloth covering His large hips, and He
wore a garland of fresh flowers which was distinguished by humming bees. His lovely wrists were graced
with bracelets, and He rested one of His hands on the shoulder of Garuda, His carrier, and twirled a lotus
with another hand.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is a full description of the Personality of Godhead as personally experienced by the sages. The
Lord's personal body was covered with yellow robes, and His waist was thin. In Vaikuntha, whenever
there is a flower garland on the chest of the Personality of Godhead or any one of His associates, it is
described that the humming bees are there. All these features were very beautiful and attractive for the
devotees. One of the Lord's hands rested on His carrier, Garuda, and in another hand He twirled a lotus
flower. These are personal characteristics of the Personality of Godhead, Narayana.
