<h2>Translation</h2>
You may narrate also about the auspicious characteristics of the Lord in His different incarnations for
the welfare of the twice-born, the cows and the demigods. Our minds are never satisfied completely,
although we continuously hear of His transcendental activities.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord appears in this universe in different incarnations like Matsya, Kurma, Varaha and Nrsimha,
and He manifests His different transcendental activities for the welfare of the twice-born, the cows and the
demigods. The Lord is directly concerned with the twice-born or civilized men. A civilized man is one
who has taken his birth twice. A living entity takes birth in this mundane world due to the union of male
and female. A human being is born due to union of the father and mother, but a civilized human being
has another birth by contact with a spiritual master, who becomes the actual father. The father and
mother of the material body are so only in one birth, and in the next birth the father and mother may be a
different couple. But the bona fide spiritual master, as the representative of the Lord, is the eternal father
because the spiritual master has the responsibility to lead the disciple to spiritual salvation, or the ultimate
goal of life. Therefore, a civilized man must be twice-born, otherwise he is no more than the lower
animals.
The cow is the most important animal for developing the human body to perfection. The body can be
maintained by any kind of foodstuff, but cow's milk is particularly essential for developing the finer
tissues of the human brain so that one can understand the intricacies of transcendental knowledge. A
civilized man is expected to live on foodstuffs comprising fruits, vegetables, grains, sugar and milk. The
bull helps in the agricultural process of producing grain, etc., and thus in one sense the bull is the father
of humankind, whereas the cow is the mother, for she supplies milk to human society. A civilized man is
therefore expected to give all protection to the bulls and cows.
The demigods, or the living entities who live in the higher planets, are far superior to human beings.
Since they have better arrangements for living conditions, they live far more luxuriously than human
beings, yet they are all devotees of the Lord. The Lord incarnates in different forms, such as those of a
fish, a tortoise, a hog, and a combined lion and man, just to give protection to civilized man, the cow and
the demigods, who are directly responsible for the regulative life of progressive self-realization. The whole
system of the material creation is planned so that the conditioned souls may have the opportunity for selfrealization.
One who takes advantage of such an arrangement is called a demigod or civilized man. The
cow is meant to help maintain such a high standard of living.
The Lord's pastimes for the protection of the twice-born civilized men, the cows and the demigods are
all transcendental. A human being is inclined to hear good narrations and stories, and therefore there are
so many books, magazines and newspapers on the market to satisfy the interests of the developed soul.
But the pleasure in such literature, after it is read once, becomes stale, and people do not take any interest
in reading such literature repeatedly. In fact, newspapers are read for less than an hour and then thrown
in the dustbins as rubbish. The case is similar with all other mundane literatures. But the beauty of
transcendental literatures like Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam is that they never become old. They
have been read in the world by civilized man for the last five thousand years, and they have never become
old. They are ever fresh to the learned scholars and devotees, and even by daily repetition of the verses of
Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, there is no satiation for devotees like Vidura. Vidura might have
heard the pastimes of the Lord many, many times before he met Maitreya, but still he wanted the same
narrations to be repeated because he was never satiated by hearing them. That is the transcendental nature
of the Lord's glorious pastimes.
