<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
sva-dharmacaranam saktya
vidharmac ca nivartanam
daival labdhena santosa
atmavic-caranarcanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sva-dharma-acaranam--executing one's prescribed duties; saktya--to the best of one's ability; vidharmat--
unauthorized duties; ca--and; nivartanam--avoiding; daivat--by the grace of the Lord; labdhena--with what
is achieved; santosah--satisfied; atma-vit--of the self-realized soul; carana--the feet; arcanam--worshiping.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One should execute his prescribed duties to the best of his ability and avoid performing duties not
allotted to him. One should be satisfied with as much gain as he achieves by the grace of the Lord, and
one should worship the lotus feet of a spiritual master.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse there are many important words which could be very elaborately explained, but we shall
briefly discuss the important aspects of each. The final statement is atmavic-caranarcanam. Atma-vit
means a self-realized soul or bona fide spiritual master. Unless one is self-realized and knows what his
relationship with the Supersoul is, he cannot be a bona fide spiritual master. Here it is recommended that
one should seek out a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him (arcanam), for by inquiring from
and worshiping him one can learn spiritual activities.
The first recommendation is sva-dharmacaranam. As long as we have this material body there are
various duties prescribed for us. Such duties are divided by a system of four social orders: brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. These particular duties are mentioned in the sastra, and particularly in
Bhagavad-gita. Sva-dharmacaranam means that one must discharge the prescribed duties of his particular
division of society faithfully and to the best of his ability. One should not accept another's duty. If one is
born in a particular society or community, he should perform the prescribed duties for that particular
division. If, however, one is fortunate enough to transcend the designation of birth in a particular society
or community by being elevated to the standard of spiritual identity, then his sva-dharma, or duty, is
solely that of serving the Supreme personality of Godhead. The actual duty of one who is advanced in
Krsna consciousness is to serve the Lord. As long as one remains in the bodily concept of life, he may act
according to the duties of social convention, but if one is elevated to the spiritual platform, he must
simply serve the Supreme Lord; that is the real execution of sva-dharma.
