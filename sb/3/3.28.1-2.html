<h2>Translation</h2>
Devahuti inquired: My dear Lord, You have already very scientifically described the symptoms of the
total material nature and the characteristics of the spirit according to the Sankhya system of philosophy.
Now I shall request You to explain the path of devotional service, which is the ultimate end of all
philosophical systems.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this Twenty-ninth Chapter, the glories of devotional service are elaborately explained, and the
influence of time on the conditioned soul is also described. The purpose of elaborately describing the
influence of time is to detach the conditioned soul from his material activities, which are considered to be
simply a waste of time. In the previous chapter, material nature, the spirit and the Supreme Lord, or
Supersoul, are analytically studied, and in this chapter the principles of bhakti-yoga, or devotional
service--the execution of activities in the eternal relationship between the living entities and the
Personality of Godhead--are explained.
Bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the basic principle of all systems of philosophy; all philosophy which
does not aim for devotional service to the Lord is considered merely mental speculation. But of course
bhakti-yoga with no philosophical basis is more or less sentiment. There are two classes of men. Some
consider themselves intellectually advanced and simply speculate and meditate, and others are
sentimental and have no philosophical basis for their propositions. Neither of these can achieve the
highest goal of life--or, if they do, it will take them many, many years. Vedic literature therefore suggests
that there are three elements--namely the Supreme Lord, the living entity and their eternal relationship--
and the goal of life is to follow the principles of bhakti, or devotional service, and ultimately attain to the
planet of the Supreme Lord in full devotion and love as an eternal servitor of the Lord.
Sankhya philosophy is the analytical study of all existence. One has to understand everything by
examining its nature and characteristics. This is called acquirement of knowledge. But one should not
simply acquire knowledge without reaching the goal of life or the basic principle for acquiring
knowledge--bhakti-yoga. If we give up bhakti-yoga and simply busy ourselves in the analytical study of
the nature of things as they are, then the result will be practically nil. It is stated in the Bhagavatam that
such engagement is something like husking a paddy. There is no use beating the husk if the grain has
already been removed. By the scientific study of material nature, the living entity and the Supersoul, one
has to understand the basic principle of devotional service to the Lord.
