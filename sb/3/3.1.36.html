<h2>Translation</h2>
Also let me inquire whether Maharaja Yudhisthira is now maintaining the kingdom according to
religious principles and with respect for the path of religion. Formerly Duryodhana was burning with
envy because Yudhisthira was being protected by the arms of Krsna and Arjuna as if they were his own
arms.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Maharaja Yudhisthira was the emblem of religion. When he was ruling his kingdom with the help of
Lord Krsna and Arjuna, the opulence of his kingdom surpassed all imaginations of the opulence of the
kingdom of heaven. His actual arms were Lord Krsna and Arjuna, and thus he surpassed everyone's
opulence. Duryodhana, being envious of this opulence, planned so many schemes to put Yudhisthira into
difficulty, and at last the Battle of Kuruksetra was brought about. After the Battle of Kuruksetra, Maharaja
Yudhisthira was again able to rule his legitimate kingdom, and he reinstated the principles of honor and
respect for religion. That is the beauty of a kingdom ruled by a pious king like Maharaja Yudhisthira.
