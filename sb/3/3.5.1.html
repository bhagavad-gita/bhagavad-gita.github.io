<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami said: Vidura, the best amongst the Kuru dynasty, who was perfect in devotional
service to the Lord, thus reached the source of the celestial Ganges River [Hardwar], where Maitreya, the
great, fathomless learned sage of the world, was seated. Vidura, who was perfect in gentleness and
satisfied in transcendence, inquired from him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vidura was already perfect due to his unalloyed devotion to the infallible Lord. The Lord and the living
entities are all qualitatively the same by nature, but the Lord is quantitatively much greater than any
individual living entity. He is ever infallible, whereas the living entities are prone to fall under the illusory
energy. Vidura had already surpassed the fallible nature of the living entity in conditional life due to his
being acyuta-bhava, or legitimately absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord. This stage of life is
called acyuta-bhava-siddha, or perfection by dint of devotional service. Anyone, therefore, who is
absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord is a liberated soul and has all admirable qualities. The
learned sage Maitreya was sitting in a solitary place on the bank of the Ganges at Hardwar, and Vidura,
who was a perfect devotee of the Lord and possessed all good transcendental qualities, approached him
for inquiry.
