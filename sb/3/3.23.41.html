<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
bhrajisnuna vimanena
kama-gena mahiyasa
vaimanikan atyaseta
caral lokan yathanilah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhrajisnuna--splendid; vimanena--with the airplane; kama-gena--which flew according to his desire;
mahiyasa--very great; vaimanikan--the demigods in their airplanes; atyaseta--he surpassed; caran--
traveling; lokan--through the planets; yatha--like; anilah--the air.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He traveled in that way through the various planets, as the air passes uncontrolled in every direction.
Coursing through the air in that great and splendid aerial mansion, which could fly at his will, he
surpassed even the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The planets occupied by the demigods are restricted to their own orbits, but Kardama Muni, by his
yogic power, could travel all over the different directions of the universe without restriction. The living
entities who are within the universe are called conditioned souls; that is, they are not free to move
everywhere. We are inhabitants of this earthly globe; we cannot move freely to other planets. In the
modern age, man is trying to go to other planets, but so far he has been unsuccessful. It is not possible to
travel to any other planets because by the laws of nature even the demigods cannot move from one planet
to another. But Kardama Muni, by his yogic power, could surpass the strength of the demigods and travel
in space in all directions. The comparison here is very suitable. The words yatha anilah indicate that as
the air is free to move anywhere without restriction, so Kardama Muni unrestrictedly traveled in all
directions of the universe.
