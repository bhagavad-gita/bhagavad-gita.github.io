<h2>Translation</h2>
By following this course, the yogi gradually develops pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Hari. In the course of his progress in devotional service, the hairs on his body stand erect through
excessive joy, and he is constantly bathed in a stream of tears occasioned by intense love. Gradually, even
the mind, which he used as a means to attract the Lord, as one attracts a fish to a hook, withdraws from
material activity.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here it is clearly mentioned that meditation, which is an action of the mind, is not the perfect stage of
samadhi, or absorption. In the beginning the mind is employed in attracting the form of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, but in the higher stages there is no question of using the mind. A devotee
becomes accustomed to serving the Supreme Lord by purification of his senses. In other words, the yoga
principles of meditation are required as long as one is not situated in pure devotional service. The mind is
used to purify the senses, but when the senses are purified by meditation, there is no need to sit in a
particular place and try to meditate upon the form of the Lord. One becomes so habituated that he
automatically engages in the personal service of the Lord. When the mind forcibly is engaged upon the
form of the Lord, this is called nirbija-yoga, or lifeless yoga, for the yogi does not automatically engage in
the personal service of the Lord. But when he is constantly thinking of the Lord, that is called sabija-yoga,
or living yoga. One has to be promoted to the platform of living yoga.
One should engage in the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day, as confirmed in the Brahmasamhita.
The stage of premanjana-cchurita can be attained by developing complete love. When one's love
for the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotional service is fully developed, one always sees the Lord,
even without artificially meditating on His form. His vision is divine because he has no other engagement.
At this stage of spiritual realization it is not necessary to engage the mind artificially. Since the meditation
recommended in the lower stages is a means to come to the platform of devotional service, those already
engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are above such meditation. This stage of
perfection is called Krsna consciousness.
