<h2>Text</h2>
manasaitani bhutani
pranamed bahu-manayan
isvaro jiva-kalaya
pravisto bhagavan iti
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
manasa--with the mind; etani--to these; bhutani--living entities; pranamet--he offers respects; bahumanayan--
showing regard; isvarah--the controller; jiva--of the living entities; kalaya--by His expansion as
the Supersoul; pravistah--has entered; bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; iti--thus.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Such a perfect devotee offers respects to every living entity because he is under the firm conviction that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead has entered the body of every living entity as the Supersoul, or
controller.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A perfect devotee, as described above, does not make the mistake of thinking that because the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as Paramatma has entered into the body of every living entity, every living entity
has become the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is foolishness. Suppose a person enters into a
room; that does not mean that the room has become that person. Similarly, that the Supreme Lord has
entered into each of the 8,400,000 particular types of material bodies does not mean that each of these
bodies has become the Supreme Lord. Because the Supreme Lord is present, however, a pure devotee
accepts each body as the temple of the Lord, and since the devotee offers respect to such temples in full
knowledge, he gives respect to every living entity in relationship with the Lord. Mayavadi philosophers
wrongly think that because the Supreme Person has entered the body of a poor man, the Supreme Lord
has become daridra-narayana, or poor Narayana. These are all blasphemous statements of atheists and
nondevotees.
