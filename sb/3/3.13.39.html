<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are worshipable by universal prayers, Vedic
hymns and sacrificial ingredients. We offer our obeisances unto You. You can be realized by the pure
mind freed from all visible and invisible material contamination. We offer our respectful obeisances to
You as the supreme spiritual master of knowledge in devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The qualification of bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord, is that the devotee should be free from all
material contaminations and desires. This freedom is called vairagya, or renouncement of material desires.
One who engages in devotional service to the Lord according to regulative principles is automatically
freed from material desires, and in that pure state of mind one can realize the Personality of Godhead. The
Personality of Godhead, being situated in everyone's heart, instructs the devotee regarding pure
devotional service so that he may ultimately achieve the association of the Lord. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (10.10) as follows:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
"To one who constantly engages in the devotional service of the Lord with faith and love, the Lord
certainly gives the intelligence to achieve Him at the ultimate end."
One has to conquer the mind, and one may do it by following the Vedic rituals and by performing
different types of sacrifice. The ultimate end of all those performances is to attain bhakti, or the devotional
service of the Lord. Without bhakti one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The
original Personality of Godhead or His innumerable expansions of Visnu are the only objects of worship
by all the Vedic rituals and sacrificial performances.
