<h2>Text</h2>
tesam supakva-yoganam
jita-svasendriyatmanam
labdha-yusmat-prasadanam
na kutascit parabhavah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tesam--of them; su-pakva-yoganam--who are mature mystics; jita--controlled; svasa--breath; indriya--the
senses; atmanam--the mind; labdha--attained; yusmat--your; prasadanam--mercy; na--not; kutascit--
anywhere; parabhavah--defeat.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
There is no defeat in this material world for persons who control the mind and senses by controlling the
breathing process and who are therefore experienced, mature mystics. This is because by such perfection
in yoga they have attained your mercy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The purpose of yogic performances is explained here. It is said that an experienced mystic attains full
control of the senses and the mind by controlling the breathing process. Therefore, controlling the
breathing process is not the ultimate aim of yoga. The real purpose of yogic performances is to control the
mind and the senses. Anyone who has such control is to be understood to be an experienced, mature
mystic yogi. It is indicated herein that a yogi who has control over the mind and senses has the actual
benediction of the Lord, and he has no fear. In other words, one cannot attain the mercy and benediction
of the Supreme Lord until one is able to control the mind and the senses. This is actually possible when
one fully engages in Krsna consciousness. A person whose senses and mind are always engaged in the
transcendental service of the Lord has no possibility of engaging in material activities. The devotees of the
Lord are not defeated anywhere in the universe. It is stated, narayana-parah sarve: one who is narayanapara,
or a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not afraid anywhere, whether he is sent to
hell or promoted to heaven (Bhag. 6.17.28).
