TRANSLATION
A pure devotee, who is attached to the activities of devotional service and who always engages in the
service of My lotus feet, never desires to become one with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly
engaged, always glorifies My pastimes and activities.
PURPORT
There are five kinds of liberation stated in the scriptures. One is to become one with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, or to forsake one's individuality and merge into the Supreme Spirit. This is called
ekatmatam. A devotee never accepts this kind of liberation. The other four liberations are: to be promoted
to the same planet as God (Vaikuntha), to associate personally with the Supreme Lord, to achieve the
same opulence as the Lord and to attain the same bodily features as the Supreme Lord. A pure devotee, as
will be explained by Kapila Muni, does not aspire for any of the five liberations. He especially despises as
hellish the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Sri Prabodhananda Sarasvati,
a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, said, kaivalyam narakayate: "The happiness of becoming one with the
Supreme Lord, which is aspired for by the Mayavadis, is considered hellish." That oneness is not for pure
devotees.
There are many so-called devotees who think that in the conditioned state we may worship the
Personality of Godhead but that ultimately there is no personality; they say that since the Absolute Truth
is impersonal, one can imagine a personal form of the impersonal Absolute Truth for the time being, but
as soon as one becomes liberated the worship stops. That is the theory put forward by the Mayavada
philosophy. Actually the impersonalists do not merge into the existence of the Supreme Person but into
His personal bodily luster, which is called the brahmajyoti. Although that brahmajyoti is not different
from His personal body, that sort of oneness (merging into the bodily luster of the Personality of
Godhead) is not accepted by a pure devotee because the devotees engage in greater pleasure than the socalled
pleasure of merging into His existence. The greatest pleasure is to serve the Lord. Devotees are
always thinking about how to serve Him; they are always designing ways and means to serve the Supreme
Lord, even in the midst of the greatest obstacles of material existence.
The Mayavadis accept the description of the pastimes of the Lord as stories, but actually they are not
stories; they are historical facts. Pure devotees accept the narrations of the pastimes of the Lord not as
stories but as Absolute Truth. The words mama paurusani are significant. Devotees are very much
attached to glorifying the activities of the Lord, whereas the Mayavadis cannot even think of these
activities. According to them the Absolute Truth is impersonal. Without personal existence, how can
there be activity? The impersonalists take the activities mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Bhagavadgita
and other Vedic literatures as fictitious stories, and therefore they interpret them most mischievously.
The have no idea of the Personality of Godhead. They unnecessarily poke their noses into the scripture
and interpret it in a deceptive way in order to mislead the innocent public. The activities of Mayavada
philosophy are very dangerous to the public, and therefore Lord Caitanya warned us never to hear from
any Mayavadi about any scripture. They will spoil the entire process, and the person hearing them will
never be able to come to the path of devotional service to attain the highest perfection, or will be able to
do so only after a very long time.
It is clearly stated by Kapila Muni that bhakti activities, or activities in devotional service, are
transcendental to mukti. This is called pancama-purusartha. Generally, people engage in the activities of
religion, economic development and sense gratification, and ultimately they work with an idea that they
are going to become one with the Supreme Lord (mukti). But bhakti is transcendental to all these
activities. The Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, begins by stating that all kinds of pretentious religiosity is
completely eradicated from the Bhagavatam. Ritualistic activities for economic development and sense
gratification and, after frustration in sense gratification, the desire to become one with the Supreme Lord,
are all completely rejected in the Bhagavatam. The Bhagavatam is especially meant for the pure devotees,
who always engage in Krsna consciousness, in the activities of the Lord, and always glorify these
transcendental activities. Pure devotees worship the transcendental activities of the Lord in Vrndavana,
Dvaraka and Mathura as they are narrated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other puranas. The Mayavadi
philosophers completely reject them as stories, but actually they are great and worshipable subject matters
and thus are relishable only for devotees. That is the difference between a Mayavadi and a pure devotee.
