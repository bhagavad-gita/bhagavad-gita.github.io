<h2>Translation</h2>
Simply by chanting and hearing of the transcendental name, form, etc., of the Personality of Godhead,
Sri Krsna, one can achieve the cessation of unlimited miserable conditions. Therefore what to speak of
those who have attained attraction for serving the flavor of the dust of the Lord's lotus feet?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Two different methods for controlling the material senses are recommended in the Vedic scriptural
wisdom. One of them is the process of jnana, or the path of philosophical understanding of the Supreme--
Brahma, Paramatma and Bhagavan. The other is that of direct engagement in the transcendental loving
devotional service of the Lord. Of these two most popular methods, the path of devotional service is
recommended here as the best because one on the path of devotional service does not have to wait for the
attainment of the fruitive results of pious activities or for the results of knowledge. The two stages of
executing devotional service are, first, the stage of practicing devotional service with our present senses
under the regulations of the recognized scriptures and, second, attaining sincere attachment for serving
the particles of the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord. The first stage is called sadhana-bhakti, or devotional
service for the neophyte, which is rendered under the direction of a pure devotee, and the second stage is
called raga-bhakti, in which the mature devotee automatically takes to the various services of the Lord out
of sincere attachment. The great sage Maitreya now gives the final answer to all the questions of Vidura:
devotional service to the Lord is the ultimate means to mitigate all the miserable conditions of material
existence. The path of knowledge or that of mystic gymnastics may be adopted as a means for the
purpose, but unless mixed with bhakti, or devotional service, they are unable to award the desired result.
By practicing sadhana-bhakti one may gradually rise to the point of raga-bhakti, and by performing ragabhakti
in loving transcendental service one can even control the Supreme Powerful Lord.
