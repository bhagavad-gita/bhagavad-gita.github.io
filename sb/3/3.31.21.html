<h2>Text</h2>
tatas te ksina-sukrtah
punar lokam imam sati
patanti vivasa devaih
sadyo vibhramsitodayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tatah--then; te--they; ksina--exhausted; su-krtah--results of their pious activities; punah--again; lokam
imam--to this planet; sati--O virtuous mother; patanti--fall; vivasah--helpless; devaih--by higher
arrangement; sadyah--suddenly; vibhramsita--caused to fall; udayah--their prosperity.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they fall down by higher arrangement and again
come back to this planet, just as any person raised to a high position sometimes all of a sudden falls.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is sometimes found that a person elevated to a very high position in government service falls down all
of a sudden, and no one can check him. Similarly, after finishing their period of enjoyment, foolish
persons who are very much interested in being elevated to the position of president in higher planets also
fall down to this planet. The distinction between the elevated position of a devotee and that of an ordinary
person attracted to fruitive activities is that when a devotee is elevated to the spiritual kingdom he never
falls down, whereas an ordinary person falls, even if he is elevated to the highest planetary system,
Brahmaloka. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (abrahma-bhuvanal lokah) that even if one is elevated to a
higher planet, he has to come down again. But Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita (8.16), mam upetya tu
kaunteya punar janma na vidyate: "Anyone who attains My abode never comes back to this conditioned
life of material existence."
