<h2>Text</h2>
yesam na tusto bhagavan
yajna-lingo janardanah
tesam sramo hy aparthaya
yad atma nadrtah svayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yesam--of those with whom; na--never; tustah--satisfied; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead; yajnalingah--
the form of sacrifice; janardanah--Lord Krsna, or the visnu-tattva; tesam--of them; sramah--labor;
hi--certainly; aparthaya--without profit; yat--because; atma--the Supreme Soul; na--not; adrtah--respected;
svayam--his own self.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Janardana [Lord Krsna], is the form to accept all the results of
sacrifice. If He is not satisfied, then one's labor for advancement is futile. He is the ultimate Self, and
therefore one who does not satisfy Him certainly neglects his own interests.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma is deputed as the supreme head of universal affairs, and he in his turn deputes Manu and others
as charges d'affaires of the material manifestation, but the whole show is for the satisfaction of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma knows how to satisfy the Lord, and similarly persons engaged
in the line of Brahma's plan of activities also know how to satisfy the Lord. The Lord is satisfied by the
process of devotional service, consisting of the ninefold process of hearing, chanting, etc. It is in one's
own sell-interest to execute prescribed devotional service, and anyone who neglects this process neglects
his own self-interest. Everyone wants to satisfy his senses, but above the senses is the mind, above the
mind is the intelligence, above the intelligence is the individual self, and above the individual self is the
Superself. Above even the Superself is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, visnu-tattva. The primeval
Lord and the cause of all causes is Sri Krsna. The complete process of perfectional service is to render
service for the satisfaction of the transcendental senses of Lord Krsna, who is known as Janardana.
