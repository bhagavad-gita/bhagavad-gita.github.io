<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the yogi can be in the self-realized position after conquering the insurmountable spell of maya,
who presents herself as both the cause and effect of this material manifestation and is therefore very
difficult to understand.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that the spell of maya, which covers the knowledge of the living entity, is
insurmountable. However, one who surrenders unto Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can
conquer this seemingly insurmountable spell of maya. Here also it is stated that the daivi prakrti, or the
external energy of the Supreme Lord, is durvibhavya, very difficult to understand and very difficult to
conquer. One must, however, conquer this insurmountable spell of maya, and this is possible, by the
grace of the Lord, when God reveals Himself to the surrendered soul. It is also stated here,
svarupenavatisthate. Svarupa means that one has to know that he is not the Supreme Soul, but rather, part
and parcel of the Supreme Soul; that is self-realization. To think falsely that one is the Supreme Soul and
that one is all-pervading is not svarupa. This is not realization of his actual position. The real position is
that one is part and parcel. It is recommended here that one remain in that position of actual selfrealization.
In Bhagavad-gita this understanding is defined as Brahman realization.
After Brahman realization, one can engage in the activities of Brahman. As long as one is not selfrealized,
he engages in activities based on false identification with the body. When one is situated in his
real self, then the activities of Brahman realization begin. The Mayavadi philosophers say that after
Brahman realization, all activities stop, but that is not actually so. If the soul is so active in its abnormal
condition, existing under the covering of matter, how can one deny its activity when free? An example
may be cited here. If a man in a diseased condition is very active, how can one imagine that when he is
free from the disease he will be inactive? Naturally the conclusion is that when one is free from all disease
his activities are pure. It may be said that the activities of Brahman realization are different from those of
conditional life, but that does not stop activity. This is indicated in Bhagavad-gita (18.54): after one
realizes oneself to be Brahman, devotional service begins. Mad-bhaktim labhate param: after Brahman
realization, one can engage in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore devotional service of the Lord
is activity in Brahman realization.
For those who engage in devotional service there is no spell of ma-ya-, and their situation is all-perfect.
The duty of the living entity, as a part and parcel of the whole, is to render devotional service to the
whole. That is the ultimate perfection of life.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-eighth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Lord Kapila's Instructions on the Execution of Devotional Service."
