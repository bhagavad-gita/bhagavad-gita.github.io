<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the great sages, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanat-kumara, upon reaching the abovementioned
Vaikuntha in the spiritual world by dint of their mystic yoga performance, perceived
unprecedented happiness. They found that the spiritual sky was illuminated by highly decorated airplanes
piloted by the best devotees of Vaikuntha and was predominated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is one without a second. He is above everyone. No one is equal to
Him, nor is anyone greater than Him. Therefore He is described here as visva-guru. He is the prime living
entity of the entire material and spiritual creation and is bhuvanaika-vandyam, the only worshipable
personality in the three worlds. The airplanes in the spiritual sky are self-illuminated and are piloted by
great devotees of the Lord. In other words, in the Vaikuntha planets there is no scarcity of the things
which are available in the material world; they are available, but they are more valuable because they are
spiritual and therefore eternal and blissful. The sages felt an unprecedented happiness because Vaikuntha
was not predominated by an ordinary man. The Vaikuntha planets are predominated by expansions of
Krsna, who are differently named as Madhusudana, Madhava, Narayana, Pradyumna, etc. These
transcendental planets are worshipable because the Personality of Godhead personally rules them. It is
said here that the sages reached the transcendental spiritual sky by dint of their mystic power. That is the
perfection of the yoga system. The breathing exercises and disciplines to keep health in proper order are
not the ultimate goals of yoga perfection. The yoga system as generally understood is astanga-yoga, or
siddhi, eightfold perfection in yoga. By dint of perfection in yoga one can become lighter than the lightest
and heavier than the heaviest; one can go wherever he likes and can achieve opulences as he likes. There
are eight such perfections. The rsis, the four Kumaras, reached Vaikuntha by becoming lighter than the
lightest and thus passing over the space of the material world. Modern mechanical space vehicles are
unsuccessful because they cannot go to the highest region of this material creation, and they certainly
cannot enter the spiritual sky. But by perfection of the yoga system one not only can travel through
material space, but can surpass material space and enter the spiritual sky. We learn this fact also from an
incident concerning Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa. It is understood that in one year Durvasa
Muni traveled everywhere and went into the spiritual sky to meet the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Narayana. By present standards, scientists calculate that if one could travel at the speed of light, it would
take forty thousand years to reach the highest planet of this material world. But the yoga system can carry
one without limitation or difficulty. The word yoga-maya is used in this verse. Yoga-maya-balena
vikuntham. The transcendental happiness exhibited in the spiritual world and all other spiritual
manifestations there are made possible by the influence of yoga-maya, the internal potency of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.
