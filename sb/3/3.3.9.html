TRANSLATION
The Yadus were all experienced devotees, learned and expert in psychic study. Over and above this, they
were always with the Lord in all kinds of relaxations, and still they were only able to know Him as the one
Supreme who dwells everywhere.
PURPORT
In the Vedas it is said that the Supreme Lord or the Paramatma cannot be understood simply by the
strength of one's erudition or power of mental speculation: nayam atma pravacanena labhyo na medhaya
na bahuna srutena (Katha Upanisad 1.2.23). He can be known only by one who has the mercy of the
Lord. The Yadavas were all exceptionally learned and experienced, but in spite of their knowing the Lord
as the one who lives in everyone's heart, they could not understand that He is the original Personality of
Godhead. This lack of knowledge was not due to their insufficient erudition; it was due to their
misfortune. In Vrndavana, however, the Lord was not even known as the Paramatma because the
residents of Vrndavana were pure unconventional devotees of the Lord and could think of Him only as
their object of love. They did not know that He is the Personality of Godhead. The Yadus, or the residents
of Dvaraka, however, could know Lord Krsna as Vasudeva, or the Supersoul living everywhere, but not as
the Supreme Lord. As scholars of the Vedas, they verified the Vedic hymns: eko devah. .. sarvabhutadhivasah...
antaryami... and vrsninam para-devata. ... The Yadus, therefore, accepted Lord Krsna as
the Supersoul incarnated in their family, and not more than that.
