<h2>Text</h2>
yatha hy apratibuddhasya
prasvapo bahv-anartha-bhrt
sa eva pratibuddhasya
na vai mohaya kalpate
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatha--as; hi--indeed; apratibuddhasya--of one who is sleeping; prasvapah--the dream; bahu-anarthabhrt--
bearing many inauspicious things; sah eva--that very dream; pratibuddhasya--of one who is awake;
na--not; vai--certainly; mohaya--for bewildering; kalpate--is capable.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
In the dreaming state one's consciousness is almost covered, and one sees many inauspicious things, but
when he is awakened and fully conscious, such inauspicious things cannot bewilder him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the condition of dreaming, when one's consciousness is almost covered, one may see many
unfavorable things which cause disturbance or anxiety, but upon awakening, although he remembers
what happened in the dream, he is not disturbed. Similarly the position of self-realization, or
understanding of one's real relationship with the Supreme Lord, makes one completely satisfied, and the
three modes of material nature, which are the cause of all disturbances, cannot affect him. In
contaminated consciousness one sees everything to be for his own enjoyment, but in pure consciousness,
or Krsna consciousness, he sees that everything exists for the enjoyment of the supreme enjoyer. That is
the difference between the dream state and wakefulness. The state of contaminated consciousness is
compared to dream consciousness, and Krsna consciousness is compared to the awakened stage of life.
Actually, as stated in Bhagavad-gita, the only absolute enjoyer is Krsna. One who can understand that
Krsna is the proprietor of all the three worlds and that He is the friend of everyone is peaceful and
independent. As long as a conditioned soul does not have this knowledge, he wants to be the enjoyer of
everything; he wants to become a humanitarian or philanthropist and open hospitals and schools for his
fellow human beings. This is all illusion, for one cannot benefit anyone by such material activities. If one
wishes to benefit his fellow brother, he must awaken his dormant Krsna consciousness. The Krsna
conscious position is that of pratibuddha, which means "pure consciousness."
