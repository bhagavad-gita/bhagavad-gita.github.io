vinastasu sva-mayasu
bhuyas cavrajya kesavam
rusopaguhamano 'mum
dadrse 'vasthitam bahih
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
vinastasu--when dispelled; sva-mayasu--his magic forces; bhuyah--again; ca--and; avrajya--after coming
into the presence; kesavam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rusa--full of rage; upaguhamanah--
embracing; amum--the Lord; dadrse--saw; avasthitam--standing; bahih--outside.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When the demon saw his magic forces dispelled, he once again came into the presence of the
Personality of Godhead, Kesava, and, full of rage, tried to embrace Him within his arms to crush Him. But
to his great amazement he found the Lord standing outside the circle of his arms.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the Lord is addressed as Kesava because He killed the demon Kesi in the beginning of
creation. Kesava is also a name of Krsna. Krsna is the origin of all incarnations, and it is confirmed in
Brahma-samhita that Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, exists
simultaneously in His different incarnations and expansions. The demon's attempt to measure the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is significant. The demon wanted to embrace Him with his arms,
thinking that with his limited arms he could capture the Absolute by material power. He did not know
that God is the greatest of the great and the smallest of the small. No one can capture the Supreme Lord or
bring Him under his control. But the demoniac person always attempts to measure the length and breadth
of the Supreme Lord. By His inconceivable potency the Lord can become the universal form, as explained
in Bhagavad-gita, and at the same time He can remain within the box of His devotees as their worshipable
Deity. There are many devotees who keep a statue of the Lord in a small box and carry it with them
everywhere; every morning they worship the Lord in the box. The Supreme Lord, Kesava, or the
Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not bound by any measurement of our calculation. He can remain with
His devotee in any suitable form, yet He is unapproachable by any amount of demoniac activities.
