<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord continued: My dear mother, devotees who receive such transcendental opulences are never
bereft of them; neither weapons nor the change of time can destroy such opulences. Because the devotees
accept Me as their friend, their relative, their son, preceptor, benefactor and Supreme Deity, they cannot
be deprived of their possessions at any time.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that one may elevate himself to the higher planetary systems, even up to
Brahmaloka, by dint of pious activities, but when the effects of such pious activities are finished, one
again comes back to this earth to begin a new life of activities. Thus even though one is promoted to the
higher planetary system for enjoyment and a long duration of life, still that is not a permanent settlement.
But as far as the devotees are concerned, their assets--the achievement of devotional service and the
consequent opulence of Vaikuntha, even on this planet--are never destroyed. In this verse Kapiladeva
addresses His mother as santa-rupa, indicating that the opulences of devotees are fixed because devotees
are eternally fixed in the Vaikuntha atmosphere, which is called santa-rupa because it is in the mode of
pure goodness, undisturbed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Once one is fixed in the devotional
service of the Lord, his position of transcendental service cannot be destroyed, and the pleasure and
service simply increase unlimitedly. For the devotees engaged in Krsna consciousness, in the Vaikuntha
atmosphere, there is no influence of time. In the material world the influence of time destroys everything,
but in the Vaikuntha atmosphere there is no influence of time or of the demigods because there are no
demigods in the Vaikuntha planets. Here our activities are controlled by different demigods; even if we
move our hand and leg, the action is controlled by the demigods. But in the Vaikuntha atmosphere there
is no influence of the demigods or of time; therefore there is no question of destruction. When the time
element is present, there is the certainty of destruction, but when there is no time element--past, present
or future--then everything is eternal. Therefore this verse uses the words na nanksyanti, indicating that
the transcendental opulences will never be destroyed.
The reason for freedom from destruction is also described. The devotees accept the Supreme Lord as the
most dear personality and reciprocate with Him in different relationships. They accept the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as the dearmost friend, the dearmost relative, the dearmost son, the dearmost
preceptor, the dearmost well-wisher or the dearmost Deity. The Lord is eternal; therefore any relationship
in which we accept Him is also eternal. It is clearly confirmed herein that the relationships cannot be
destroyed, and therefore the opulences of those relationships are never destroyed. Every living entity has
the propensity to love someone. We can see that if someone has no object of love, he generally directs his
love to a pet animal like a cat or a dog. Thus the eternal propensity for love in all living entities is always
searching for a place to reside. From this verse we can learn that we can love the Supreme Personality of
Godhead as our dearmost object--as a friend, as a son, as a preceptor or as a well-wisher--and there will be
no cheating and no end to such love. We shall eternally enjoy the relationship with the Supreme Lord in
different aspects. A special feature of this verse is the acceptance of the Supreme Lord as the supreme
preceptor. Bhagavad-gita was spoken directly by the Supreme Lord, and Arjuna accepted Krsna as guru, or
spiritual master. Similarly, we should accept only Krsna as the supreme spiritual master.
Krsna, of course, means Krsna and His confidential devotees; Krsna is not alone. When we speak of
Krsna, "Krsna" means Krsna in His name, in His form, in His qualities, in His abode and in His associates.
Krsna is never alone, for the devotees of Krsna are not impersonalists. For example, a king is always
associated with his secretary, his commander, his servant and so much paraphernalia. As soon as we
accept Krsna and His associates as our preceptors, no ill effects can destroy our knowledge. In the
material world the knowledge which we acquire may change because of the influence of time, but
nevertheless the conclusions received from Bhagavad-gita, directly from the speeches of the Supreme
Lord, Krsna, can never change. There is no use interpreting Bhagavad-gita; it is eternal.
Krsna, the Supreme Lord, should be accepted as one's best friend. He will never cheat. He will always
give His friendly advice and friendly protection to the devotee. If Krsna is accepted as a son, He will never
die. Here we have a very loving son or child, but the father and mother, or those who are affectionate
towards him, always hope, "May my son not die." But Krsna actually never will die. Therefore those who
accept Krsna, or the Supreme Lord, as their son will never be bereft of their son. In many instances
devotees have accepted the Deity as a son. In Bengal there are many such instances, and even after the
death of the devotee, the Deity performs the sraddha ceremony for the father. The relationship is never
destroyed. People are accustomed to worship different forms of demigods, but in Bhagavad-gita such a
mentality is condemned; therefore one should be intelligent enough to worship only the Supreme
Personality of Godhead in His different forms such as Laksmi-Narayana, Sita-Rama and Radha-Krsna.
Thus one will never be cheated. By worshiping the demigods one may elevate himself to the higher
planets, but during the dissolution of the material world, the deity and the abode of the deity will be
destroyed. But one who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead is promoted to the Vaikuntha
planets, where there is no influence of time, destruction or annihilation. The conclusion is that the time
influence cannot act upon devotees who have accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as
everything.
