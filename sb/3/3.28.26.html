<h2>Translation</h2>
The yogi should then meditate on the chest of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the abode of
goddess Maha-Laksmi. The Lord's chest is the source of all transcendental pleasure for the mind and full
satisfaction for the eyes. The yogi should then imprint on his mind the neck of the Personality of
Godhead, who is adored by the entire universe. The neck of the Lord serves to enhance the beauty of the
Kaustubha gem, which hangs on His chest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Upanisads it is said that the various energies of the Lord are working to create, destroy and
maintain. These inconceivable varieties of energy are stored in the bosom of the Lord. As people generally
say, God is all-powerful. That prowess is represented by Maha-Laksmi, the reservoir of all energies, who is
situated on the bosom of the transcendental form of the Lord. The yogi who can meditate perfectly on
that spot on the transcendental form of the Lord can derive many material powers, which comprise the
eight perfections of the yoga system.
It is stated herein that the beauty of the neck of the Lord enhances the beauty of the Kaustubha gem
rather than vice versa. The gem itself becomes more beautiful because it is situated on the neck of the
Lord. A yogi is therefore recommended to meditate upon the Lord's neck. The Lord's transcendental form
can either be meditated upon in the mind or placed in a temple in the form of a statue and decorated in
such a way that everyone can contemplate it. Temple worship, therefore, is meant for persons who are not
so advanced that they can meditate upon the form of the Lord. There is no difference between constantly
visiting the temple and directly seeing the transcendental form of the Lord; they are of equal value. The
advantageous position of the yogi is that he can sit anywhere in a solitary place and meditate upon the
form of the Lord. A less advanced person, however, has to go to the temple, and as long as he does not go
to the temple he is unable to see the form of the Lord. Either by hearing, seeing or meditating, the
objective is the transcendental form of the Lord; there is no question of voidness or impersonalism. The
Lord can bestow the blessings of transcendental pleasure upon either the visitor of the temple, the
meditator-yogi or one who hears about the Lord's transcendental form from scriptures like the Srimad-
Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita. There are nine processes for executing devotional service, of which
smaranam, or meditation, is one. Yogis take advantage of the process of smaranam, whereas bhakti-yogis
take special advantage of the process of hearing and chanting.
