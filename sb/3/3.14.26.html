<h2>Text</h2>
na yasya loke sva-janah paro va
natyadrto nota kascid vigarhyah
vayam vratair yac-caranapaviddham
asasmahe 'jam bata bhukta-bhogam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--never; yasya--of whom; loke--in the world; sva-janah--kinsman; parah--unconnected; va--nor; na--
neither; ati--greater; adrtah--favorable; na--not; uta--or; kascit--anyone; vigarhyah--criminal; vayam--we;
vrataih--by vows; yat--whose; carana--feet; apaviddham--rejected; asasmahe--respectfully worship; ajam--
maha-prasada; bata--certainly; bhukta-bhogam--remnants of foodstuff.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Siva regards no one as his relative, yet there is no one who is not connected with him; he does not
regard anyone as very favorable or abominable. We respectfully worship the remnants of his foodstuff,
and we vow to accept what is rejected by him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kasyapa informed his wife that just because Lord Siva happened to be his brother-in-law, that should
not encourage her in her offense towards him. Kasyapa warned her that actually Lord Siva is not
connected with anyone, nor is anyone his enemy. Since he is one of the three controllers of the universal
affairs, he is equal to everyone. His greatness is incomparable because he is a great devotee of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. It is said that among all the devotees of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Siva is
the greatest. Thus the remnants of foodstuff left by him are accepted by other devotees as maha-prasada,
or great spiritual foodstuff. The remnants of foodstuff offered to Lord Krsna are called prasada, but when
the same prasada is eaten by a great devotee like Lord Siva, it is called maha-prasada. Lord Siva is so great
that he does not care for the material prosperity for which every one of us is so eager. Parvati, who is the
powerful material nature personified, is under his full control as his wife, yet he does not use her even to
build a residential house. He prefers to remain without shelter, and his great wife also agrees to live with
him humbly. People in general worship goddess Durga, the wife of Lord Siva, for material prosperity, but
Lord Siva engages her in his service without material desire. He simply advises his great wife that of all
kinds of worship, the worship of Visnu is the highest, and greater than that is the worship of a great
devotee or anything in relation with Visnu.
