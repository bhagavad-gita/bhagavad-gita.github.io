<h2>Translation</h2>
[After the end of the Battle of Kuruksetra, the Lord said:] The abatement of the earth's great burden,
eighteen aksauhinis, has now been effected with the help of Drona, Bhisma, Arjuna and Bhima. But what
is this? There is still the great strength of the Yadu dynasty, born of Myself, which may be a more
unbearable burden.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is a wrong theory that due to an increase in population the world becomes overburdened and
therefore there are wars and other annihilating processes. The earth is never overburdened. The heaviest
mountains and oceans on the face of the earth hold more living entities than there are human beings, and
they are not overburdened. If a census were taken of all the living beings on the surface of the earth,
certainly it would be found that the number of humans is not even five percent of the total number of
living beings. If the birthrate of human beings is increasing, then the birthrate of other living beings is
increasing proportionately. The birthrate of lower animals--beasts, aquatics, birds, etc.--is far greater than
that of human beings. There is an adequate arrangement for food for all the living beings all over the earth
by the order of the Supreme Lord, and He can arrange more and more if there is actually a
disproportionate increase of living beings.
Therefore, there is no question of an increase in population causing a burden. The earth became
overburdened due to dharma-glani, or irregular discharge of the Lord's desire. The Lord appeared on the
earth to curb the increase in miscreants, and not the increase in population, as is wrongly put forward by
the mundane economist. When Lord Krsna appeared, there had been a sufficient increase in miscreants
who had violated the desire of the Lord. The material creation is meant for fulfilling the desire of the
Lord, and His desire is that the conditioned souls who are unfit to enter into the kingdom of God have a
chance to improve their conditions for entering. The entire process of cosmic arrangement is intended
just to give a chance to the conditioned souls to enter the kingdom of God, and there is an adequate
arrangement for their maintenance by the nature of the Lord.
Therefore, although there may be a great increase in population on the surface of the earth, if the people
are exactly in line with God consciousness and are not miscreants, such a burden on the earth is a source
of pleasure for her. There are two kinds of burdens. There is the burden of the beast and the burden of
love. The burden of the beast is unbearable, but the burden of love is a source of pleasure. Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti describes the burden of love very practically. He says that the burden of the
husband on the young wife, the burden of the child on the lap of the mother, and the burden of wealth on
the businessman, although actually burdens from the viewpoint of heaviness, are sources of pleasure, and
in the absence of such burdensome objects, one may feel the burden of separation, which is heavier to
bear than the actual burden of love. When Lord Krsna referred to the burden of the Yadu dynasty on the
earth, He referred to something different than the burden of the beast. The large numbers of family
members born of Lord Krsna counted to some millions and were certainly a great increase in the
population of the earth, but because all of them were expansions of the Lord Himself by His
transcendental plenary expansions, they were a source of great pleasure for the earth. When the Lord
referred to them in connection with the burden on the earth, He had in mind their imminent
disappearance from the earth. All the members of the family of Lord Krsna were incarnations of different
demigods, and they were to disappear from the surface of the earth along with the Lord. When He
referred to the unbearable heaviness on the earth in connection with the Yadu dynasty, He was referring
to the burden of their separation. Srila Jiva Gosvami confirms this inference.
