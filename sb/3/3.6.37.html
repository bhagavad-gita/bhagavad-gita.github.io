<h2>Text</h2>
ekanta-labham vacaso nu pumsam
susloka-mauler guna-vadam ahuh
srutes ca vidvadbhir upakrtayam
katha-sudhayam upasamprayogam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
eka-anta--the one which has no comparison; labham--gain; vacasah--by discussions; nu pumsam--after
the Supreme Person; susloka--pious; mauleh--activities; guna-vadam--glorification; ahuh--it is so said;
sruteh--of the ear; ca--also; vidvadbhih--by the learned; upakrtayam--being so edited; katha-sudhayam--in
the nectar of such a transcendental message; upasamprayogam--serves the real purpose, being nearer to.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The highest perfectional gain of humanity is to engage in discussions of the activities and glories of the
Pious Actor. Such activities are so nicely arranged in writing by the greatly learned sages that the actual
purpose of the ear is served just by being near them.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The impersonalists are very much afraid of hearing the activities of the Lord because they think that the
happiness derived from the transcendental situation of Brahman is the ultimate goal of life; they think that
anyone's activity, even that of the Personality of Godhead, is mundane. But the idea of happiness
indicated in this verse is different because it relates to the activities of the Supreme Personality, who has
transcendental qualities. The word guna-vadam is significant because the qualities of the Lord and His
activities and pastimes are the subject matter for the discussions of devotees. A rsi like Maitreya is
certainly not interested in discussing anything pertaining to mundane qualities, yet he says that the
highest perfectional stage of transcendental realization is to discuss the Lord's activities. Srila Jiva
Gosvami, therefore, concludes that topics regarding the transcendental activities of the Lord are far
beyond the transcendental realization of kaivalya happiness. These transcendental activities of the Lord
are so arranged in writing by the great sages that simply by hearing of those narrations one becomes
perfectly self-realized, and the proper use of the ear and the tongue is also achieved. Srimad-Bhagavatam
is one of such great literatures, and the highest perfectional state of life is attained simply by hearing and
reciting its contents.
