<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
evam samuditas tena
kapilena prajapatih
daksini-krtya tam prito
vanam eva jagama ha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--the great sage Maitreya said; evam--thus; samuditah--addressed; tena--by Him;
kapilena--by Kapila; prajapatih--the progenitor of human society; daksini-krtya--having circumambulated;
tam--Him; pritah--being pacified; vanam--to the forest; eva--indeed; jagama--he left; ha--then.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: Thus when Kardama Muni, the progenitor of human society, was spoken to in fullness
by his son, Kapila, he circumambulated Him, and with a good, pacified mind he at once left for the forest.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Going to the forest is compulsory for everyone. It is not a mental excursion upon which one person
goes and another does not. Everyone should go to the forest at least as a vanaprastha. Forest-going means
to take one-hundred-percent shelter of the Supreme Lord, as explained by Prahlada Maharaja in his talks
with his father. Sada samudvigna-dhiyam (Bhag. 7.5.5). People who have accepted a temporary, material
body are always full of anxieties. One should not, therefore, be very much affected by this material body,
but should try to be freed. The preliminary process to become freed is to go to the forest or give up family
relationships and exclusively engage in Krsna consciousness. That is the purpose of going to the forest.
Otherwise, the forest is only a place of monkeys and wild animals. To go to the forest does not mean to
become a monkey or a ferocious animal. It means to accept exclusively the shelter of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead and engage oneself in full service. One does not actually have to go to the forest.
At the present moment this is not at all advisable for a man who has spent his life all along in big cities. As
explained by Prahlada Maharaja (hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam), one should not remain always
engaged in the responsibilities of family life because family life without Krsna consciousness is just like a
blind well. Alone in a field, if one falls into a blind well and no one is there to save him, he may cry for
years, and no one will see or hear where the crying is coming from. Death is sure. Similarly, those who are
forgetful of their eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord are in the blind well of family life; their
position is very ominous. Prahlada Maharaja advised that one should give up this well somehow or other
and take to Krsna consciousness and thus be freed from material entanglement, which is full of anxieties.
