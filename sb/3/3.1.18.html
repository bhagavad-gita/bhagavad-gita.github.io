<h2>Text</h2>
puresu punyopavanadri-kunjesv
apanka-toyesu sarit-sarahsu
ananta-lingaih samalankrtesu
cacara tirthayatanesv ananyah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
puresu--holy places like Ayodhya, Dvaraka and Mathura; punya--piety; upavana--the air; adri--hill;
kunjesu--in the orchards; apanka--without sin; toyesu--in the water; sarit--river; sarahsu--lakes; anantalingaih--
the forms of the Unlimited; samalankrtesu--being so decorated; cacara--executed; tirtha--places of
pilgrimage; ayatanesu--holy lands; ananyah--alone or seeing Krsna alone.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He began to travel alone, thinking only of Krsna, through various holy places like Ayodhya, Dvaraka
and Mathura. He traveled where the air, hill, orchard, river and lake are all pure and sinless and where the
forms of the Unlimited decorate the temples. Thus he performed the pilgrim's progress.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
These arca forms of the Lord may be considered idols by the atheists, but that does not matter for
persons like Vidura or His many other servants. The forms of the Lord are mentioned here as anantalinga.
Such forms of the Lord have unlimited potency, the same as that of the Lord Himself. There is no
difference between the potencies of the arca and those of the personal forms of the Lord. The example of
the postbox and post office may be applied here. The little postboxes distributed all over the city have the
same potency as the postal system in general. The duty of the post office is to carry letters from one place
to another. If one puts letters in postboxes authorized by the general post office, the function of carrying
letters is performed without a doubt. Similarly, the arca-murti can also deliver the same unlimited potency
of the Lord as when He is personally present. Vidura, therefore, could see nothing but Krsna in the
different arca forms, and ultimately he was able to realize Krsna alone and nothing else.
