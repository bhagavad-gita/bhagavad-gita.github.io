<h2>Text</h2>
devahutir uvaca
nirvinna nitaram bhumann
asad-indriya-tarsanat
yena sambhavyamanena
prapannandham tamah prabho
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
devahutih uvaca--Devahuti said; nirvinna--disgusted; nitaram--very; bhuman--O my Lord; asat--
impermanent; indriya--of the senses; tarsanat--from agitation; yena--by which; sambhavyamanena--being
prevalent; prapanna--I have fallen; andham tamah--into the abyss of ignorance; prabho--O my Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Devahuti said: I am very sick of the disturbance caused by my material senses, for because of this sense
disturbance, my Lord, I have fallen into the abyss of ignorance.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the word asad-indriya-tarsanat is significant. Asat means "impermanent," "temporary," and indriya
means "senses." Thus asad-indriya-tarsanat means "from being agitated by the temporarily manifest
senses of the material body." We are evolving through different statuses of material bodily existence--
sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body--and therefore the engagements of our
material senses are also changing. Anything which changes is called temporary, or asat. We should know
that beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now covered by the material
body. The permanent senses, being contaminated by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service,
therefore, involves freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is completely
removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Krsna consciousness, we have reached sad-indriya,
or eternal sensory activities. Eternal sensory activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary
sensory activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of material sense gratification,
there is no opportunity to hear transcendental messages from a person like Kapila. Devahuti expressed
that she was tired. Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing the
instructions of Lord Kapila.
