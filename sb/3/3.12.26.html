<h2>Text</h2>
hrdi kamo bhruvah krodho
lobhas cadhara-dacchadat
asyad vak sindhavo medhran
nirrtih payor aghasrayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
hrdi--from the heart; kamah--lust; bhruvah--from the eyebrows; krodhah--anger; lobhah--greed; ca--
also; adhara-dacchadat--from between the lips; asyat--from the mouth; vak--speaking; sindhavah--the
seas; medhrat--from the penis; nirrtih--low activities; payoh--from the anus; agha-asrayah--reservoir of all
vices.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lust and desire became manifested from the heart of Brahma, anger from between his eyebrows, greed
from between his lips, the power of speaking from his mouth, the ocean from his penis, and low and
abominable activities from his anus, the source of all sins.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A conditioned soul is under the influence of mental speculation. However great one may be in the
estimation of mundane education and learning, he cannot be free from the influence of psychic activities.
Therefore it is very difficult to give up lust and the desires for low activities until one is in the line of
devotional service to the Lord. When one is frustrated in lust and low desires, anger is generated from the
mind and expressed from between the eyebrows. Ordinary men are therefore advised to concentrate the
mind by focusing on the place between the eyebrows, whereas the devotees of the Lord are already
practiced to place the Supreme Personality of Godhead on the seat of their minds. The theory of becoming
desireless is untenable because the mind cannot be made desireless. When it is recommended that one be
desireless, it is understood that one should not desire things which are destructive to spiritual values. A
devotee of the Lord always has the Lord in his mind, and thus he does not need to be desireless because
all his desires are in relationship with the service of the Lord. The power of speaking is called Sarasvati, or
the goddess of learning, and the birthplace of the goddess of learning is the mouth of Brahma. Even if a
man is endowed with the favor of the goddess of learning, it is quite possible for his heart to be full of lust
and material desire and his eyebrows to display symptoms of anger. One may be very learned in the
mundane estimation, but that does not mean that he is free from all low activities of lust and anger. Good
qualifications can be expected only from a pure devotee, who is always engaged in the thought of the
Lord, or in samadhi, with faith.
