<h2>Translation</h2>
Just try to understand the mighty strength of My maya in the shape of woman, who by the mere
movement of her eyebrows can keep even the greatest conquerors of the world under her grip.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many instances in the history of the world of a great conqueror's being captivated by the
charms of a Cleopatra. One has to study the captivating potency of woman, and man's attraction for that
potency. From what source was this generated? According to Vedanta-sutra, we can understand that
everything is generated from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is enunciated there, janmady asya
yatah. This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Person, Brahman, the
Absolute Truth, is the source from whom everything emanates. The captivating power of woman, and
man's susceptibility to such attraction, must also exist in the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the
spiritual world and must be represented in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord.
The Lord is the Supreme Person, the supreme male. As a common male wants to be attracted by a
female, that propensity similarly exists in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also wants to be
attracted by the beautiful features of a woman. Now the question is, if He wants to be captivated by such
womanly attraction, would He be attracted by any material woman? It is not possible. Even persons who
are in this material existence can give up womanly attraction if they are attracted by the Supreme
Brahman. Such was the case with Haridasa Thakura. A beautiful prostitute tried to attract him in the dead
of night, but since he was situated in devotional service, in transcendental love of Godhead, Haridasa
Thakura was not captivated. Rather, he turned the prostitute into a great devotee by his transcendental
association. This material attraction, therefore, certainly cannot attract the Supreme Lord. When He wants
to be attracted by a woman, He has to create such a woman from His own energy. That woman is
Radharani. It is explained by the Gosvamis that Radharani is the manifestation of the pleasure potency of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Supreme Lord wants to derive transcendental pleasure,
He has to create a woman from His internal potency. Thus the tendency to be attracted by womanly
beauty is natural because it exists in the spiritual world. In the material world it is reflected pervertedly,
and therefore there are so many inebrieties.
Instead of being attracted by material beauty, if one is accustomed to be attracted by the beauty of
Radharani and Krsna, then the statement of Bhagavad-gita, param drstva nivartate, holds true. When one
is attracted by the transcendental beauty of Radha and Krsna, he is no longer attracted by material
feminine beauty. That is the special significance of Radha-Krsna worship. That is testified to by
Yamunacarya. He says, "Since I have become attracted by the beauty of Radha and Krsna, when there is
attraction for a woman or a memory of sex life with a woman, I at once spit on it, and my face turns in
disgust." When we are attracted by Madana-mohana and the beauty of Krsna and His consorts, then the
shackles of conditioned life, namely the beauty of a material woman, cannot attract us.
