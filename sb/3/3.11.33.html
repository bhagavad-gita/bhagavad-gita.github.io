<h2>Text</h2>
evam-vidhair aho-ratraih
kala-gatyopalaksitaih
apaksitam ivasyapi
paramayur vayah-satam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; vidhaih--by the process of; ahah--days; ratraih--by nights; kala-gatya--advancement of time;
upalaksitaih--by such symptoms; apaksitam--declined; iva--just like; asya--his; api--although; paramaayuh--
duration of life; vayah--years; satam--one hundred.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the process of the exhaustion of the duration of life exists for every one of the living beings,
including Lord Brahma. One's life endures for only one hundred years, in terms of the times in the
different planets.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living being lives for one hundred years in terms of the times in different planets for different
entities. These one hundred years of life are not equal in every case. The longest duration of one hundred
years belongs to Brahma, but although the life of Brahma is very long, it expires in the course of time.
Brahma is also afraid of his death, and thus he performs devotional service to the Lord, just to release
himself from the clutches of illusory energy. Animals, of course, have no sense of responsibility, but even
humans, who have developed a sense of responsibility, while away their valuable time without engaging
in devotional service to the Lord; they live merrily, unafraid of impending death. This is the madness of
human society. The madman has no responsibility in life. Similarly, a human being who does not develop
a sense of responsibility before he dies is no better than the madman who tries to enjoy material life very
happily without concern for the future. It is necessary that every human being be responsible in preparing
himself for the next life, even if he has a duration of life like that of Brahma, the greatest of all living
creatures within the universe.
