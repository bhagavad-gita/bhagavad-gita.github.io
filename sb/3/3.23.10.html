<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Devahuti said: My dear husband, O best of brahmanas, I know that you have achieved perfection and
are the master of all the infallible mystic powers because you are under the protection of yogamaya, the
transcendental nature. But you once made a promise that our bodily union should now fulfill, since
children are a great quality for a chaste woman who has a glorious husband.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti expressed her happiness by uttering the word bata, for she knew that her husband was in a
highly elevated, transcendental position and was under the shelter of yogamaya. As stated in Bhagavadgita,
those who are great souls, mahatmas, are not under the control of the material energy. The Supreme
Lord has two energies, material and spiritual. The living entities are marginal energy. As marginal energy,
a person may be under the control of the material energy or the spiritual energy (yogamaya). Kardama
Muni was a great soul, and therefore he was under the spiritual energy, which means that he was directly
connected with the Supreme Lord. The symptom of this is Krsna consciousness, constant engagement in
devotional service. This was known to Devahuti, yet she was anxious to have a son by bodily union with
the sage. She reminded her husband of his promise to her parents: "I will remain only until the time of
Devahuti's pregnancy." She reminded him that for a chaste woman to have a child by a great personality is
most glorious. She wanted to be pregnant, and she prayed for that. The word stri means "expansion." By
bodily union of the husband and wife their qualities are expanded: children born of good parents are
expansions of the parents' personal qualifications. Both Kardama Muni and Devahuti were spiritually
enlightened; therefore she desired from the beginning that first she be pregnant and then she be
empowered with the achievement of God's grace and love of God. For a woman it is a great ambition to
have a son of the same quality as a highly qualified husband. Since she had the opportunity to have
Kardama Muni as her husband, she also desired to have a child by bodily union.
