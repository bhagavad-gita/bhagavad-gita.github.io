<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
brahman duhitrbhis tubhyam
vimrgyah patayah samah
kascit syan me visokaya
tvayi pravrajite vanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
brahman--my dear brahmana; duhitrbhih--by the daughters themselves; tubhyam--for you; vimrgyah--to
be found out; patayah--husbands; samah--suitable; kascit--someone; syat--there should be; me--my;
visokaya--for solace; tvayi--when you; pravrajite--departed; vanam--to the forest.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear brahmana, as far as your daughters are concerned, they will find their own suitable husbands
and go away to their respective homes. But who will give me solace after your departure as a sannyasi?
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that the father himself becomes the son in another form. The father and son are therefore
considered to be nondifferent. A widow who has her son is actually not a widow, because she has the
representative of her husband. Similarly, Devahuti is indirectly asking Kardama Muni to leave a
representative so that in his absence she might be relieved of her anxieties by a suitable son. A
householder is not expected to remain at home for all his days. After getting his sons and daughters
married, a householder can retire from household life, leaving his wife in the charge of the grown-up
sons. That is the social convention of the Vedic system. Devahuti is indirectly asking that in his absence
from home there be at least one male child to give her relief from her anxieties. This relief means spiritual
instruction. Relief does not mean material comforts. Material comforts will end with the end of the body,
but spiritual instruction will not end; it will go on with the spirit soul. Instruction in spiritual
advancement is necessary, but without having a worthy son, how could Devahuti advance in spiritual
knowledge? It is the duty of the husband to liquidate his debt to his wife. The wife gives her sincere
service to the husband, and he becomes indebted to her because one cannot accept service from his
subordinate without giving him something in exchange. The spiritual master cannot accept service from a
disciple without awarding him spiritual instruction. That is the reciprocation of love and duty. Thus
Devahuti reminds her husband, Kardama Muni, that she has rendered him faithful service. Even
considering the situation on the basis of liquidating his debt toward his wife, he must give a male child
before he leaves. Indirectly, Devahuti requests her husband to remain at home a few days more, or at least
until a male child is born.
