<h2>Translation</h2>
Knowledge is the ultimate perfection of self-realization. I shall explain that knowledge unto you by
which the knots of attachment to the material world are cut.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that by proper understanding of the pure self, or by self-realization, one can be freed from
material attachment. Knowledge leads one to attain the ultimate perfection of life and to see oneself as he
is. The Svetasvatara Upanisad (3.8) also confirms this. Tam eva viditvati-mrtyum eti: simply by
understanding one's spiritual position, or by seeing oneself as he is, one can be freed from material
entanglement. In various ways, the seeing of oneself is described in the Vedic literatures, and it is
confirmed in the Bhagavatam (purusasya atma-darsanam) that one has to see oneself and know what he
is. As Kapiladeva explains to His mother, this "seeing" can be done by hearing from the proper
authoritative source. Kapiladeva is the greatest authority because He is the Personality of Godhead, and if
someone accepts whatever is explained as it is, without interpretation, then he can see himself.
Lord Caitanya explained to Sanatana Gosvami the real constitutional position of the individual. He said
directly that each and every individual soul is eternally a servitor of Krsna. Jivera 'svarupa' haya--krsnera
'nitya-dasa': every individual soul is eternally a servitor. When one is fixed in the understanding that he is
part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and that his eternal position is to serve in association with the
Supreme Lord, he becomes self-realized. This position of rightly understanding oneself cuts the knot of
material attraction (hrdaya-granthi-bhedanam). Due to false ego, or false identification of oneself with the
body and the material world, one is entrapped by maya, but as soon as one understands that he is
qualitatively the same substance as the Supreme Lord because he belongs to the same category of spirit
soul, and that his perpetual position is to serve, one attains atma-darsanam and hrdaya-granthi-bhedanam,
self-realization. When one can cut the knot of attachment to the material world, his understanding is
called knowledge. Atma-darsanam means to see oneself by knowledge; therefore, when one is freed from
the false ego by the cultivation of real knowledge, he sees himself, and that is the ultimate necessity of
human life. The soul is thus isolated from the entanglement of the twenty-four categories of material
nature. Pursuit of the systematic philosophic process called Sankhya is called knowledge and selfrevelation.
