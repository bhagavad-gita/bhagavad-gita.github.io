<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prajapatih--Kasyapa; nama--names; tayoh--of the two; akarsit--gave; yah--who; prak--first; sva-dehat--
from his body; yamayoh--of the twins; ajayata--was delivered; tam--him; vai--indeed; hiranyakasipum--

<h2>Translation</h2>
Kasyapa, Prajapati, the creator of the living entities, gave his twin sons their names; the one who was
born first he named Hiranyaksa, and the one who was first conceived by Diti he named Hiranyakasipu.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There is an authoritative Vedic literature called Pinda-siddhi in which the scientific understanding of
pregnancy is very nicely described. It is stated that when the male secretion enters the menstrual flux in
the uterus in two successive drops, the mother develops two embryos in her womb, and she brings forth
twins in a reverse order to that in which they were first conceived; the child conceived first is born later,
and the one conceived later is brought forth first. The first child conceived in the womb lives behind the
second child, so when birth takes place the second child appears first, and the first child appears second.
In this case it is understood that Hiranyaksa, the second child conceived, was delivered first, whereas
Hiranyakasipu, the child who was behind him, having been conceived first, was born second.
