<h2>Text</h2>
tasmin prasanne sakalasisam prabhau
kim durlabham tabhir alam lavatmabhih
ananya-drstya bhajatam guhasayah
svayam vidhatte sva-gatim parah param
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmin--unto Him; prasanne--being pleased; sakala-asisam--of all benediction; prabhau--unto the Lord;
kim--what is that; durlabham--very difficult to obtain; tabhih--with them; alam--away; lava-atmabhih--
with insignificant gains; ananya-drstya--by nothing but devotional service; bhajatam--of those who are
engaged in devotional service; guha-asayah--residing within the heart; svayam--personally; vidhatte--
executes; sva-gatim--in His own abode; parah--the supreme; param--transcendental.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Nothing remains unachieved when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with someone. By
transcendental achievement one understands everything else to be insignificant. One who engages in
transcendental loving service is elevated to the highest perfectional stage by the Lord Himself, who is
seated in everyone's heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (10.10), the Lord gives intelligence to the pure devotees so that they may be
elevated to the highest perfectional stage. It is confirmed herein that a pure devotee, who constantly
engages in the loving service of the Lord, is awarded all knowledge necessary to reach the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. For such a devotee there is nothing valuable to be achieved but the Lord's
service. If one serves faithfully, there is no possibility of frustration because the Lord Himself takes charge
of the devotee's advancement. The Lord is seated in everyone's heart, and He knows the devotee's motive
and arranges everything achievable. In other words, the pseudo devotee, who is anxious to achieve
material gains, cannot attain the highest perfectional stage because the Lord is in knowledge of his motive.
One merely has to become sincere in his purpose, and then the Lord is there to help in every way.
