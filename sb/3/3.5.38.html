<h2>Translation</h2>
The controlling deities of all the above-mentioned physical elements are empowered expansions of Lord
Visnu. They are embodied by eternal time under the external energy, and they are His parts and parcels.
Because they were entrusted with different functions of universal duties and were unable to perform
them, they offered fascinating prayers to the Lord as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The conception of various controlling demigods who inhabit the higher planetary systems for the
management of universal affairs is not imaginary, as proposed by persons with a poor fund of knowledge.
The demigods are expanded parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord Visnu, and they are embodied by time,
external energy and partial consciousness of the Supreme. Human beings, animals, birds, etc., are also
parts and parcels of the Lord and have different material bodies, but they are not the controlling deities of
material affairs. They are, rather, controlled by such demigods. Such control is not superfluous; it is as
necessary as the controlling departments in the affairs of a modern state. The demigods should not be
despised by the controlled living beings. They are all great devotees of the Lord entrusted to execute
certain functions of universal affairs. One may be angry with Yamaraja for his thankless task of punishing
sinful souls, but Yamaraja is one of the authorized devotees of the Lord, and so are all the other demigods.
A devotee of the Lord is never controlled by such deputed demigods, who function as assistants of the
Lord, but he shows them all respects on account of the responsible positions to which they have been
appointed by the Lord. At the same time, a devotee of the Lord does not foolishly mistake them to be the
Supreme Lord. Only foolish persons accept the demigods as being on the same level as Visnu; actually
they are all appointed as servants of Visnu.
Anyone who places the Lord and the demigods on the same level is called a pasandi, or atheist. The
demigods are worshiped by persons who are more or less adherents of the processes of jnana, yoga and
karma, i.e., the impersonalists, meditators and fruitive workers. The devotees, however, worship only the
Supreme Lord Visnu. This worship is not for any material benefit, as desired by all the materialists, even
up to the salvationists, mystics and fruitive workers. Devotees worship the Supreme Lord to attain
unalloyed devotion to the Lord. The Lord, however, is not worshiped by others, who have no program for
attaining love of God, which is the essential aim of human life. Persons averse to a loving relationship
with God are more or less condemned by their own actions.
The Lord is equal to every living entity, just like the flowing Ganges. The Ganges water is meant for the
purification of everyone, yet the trees on the banks of the Ganges have different values. A mango tree on
the bank of the Ganges drinks the water, and the nimba tree also drinks the same water. But the fruits of
both trees are different. One is celestially sweet, and the other is hellishly bitter. The condemned
bitterness of the nimba is due to its own past work, just as the sweetness of the mango is also due to its
own karma. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):
tan aham dvisatah kruran
samsaresu naradhaman
ksipamy ajasram asubhan
asurisv eva yonisu
"The envious, the mischievous, the lowest of mankind, these do I ever put back into the ocean of
material existence, into various demoniac species of life." Demigods like Yamaraja and other controllers
are there for the unwanted conditioned souls who always engage in threatening the tranquillity of the
kingdom of God. Since all the demigods are confidential devotee-servitors of the Lord, they are never to
be condemned.
