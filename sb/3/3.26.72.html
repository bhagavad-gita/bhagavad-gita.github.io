tam--upon Him; asmin--in this; pratyak-atmanam--the Supersoul; dhiya--with the mind; yogapravrttaya--
engaged in devotional service; bhaktya--through devotion; viraktya--through detachment;
jnanena--through spiritual knowledge; vivicya--considering carefully; atmani--in the body; cintayet--one
should contemplate.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, through devotion, detachment and advancement in spiritual knowledge acquired through
concentrated devotional service, one should contemplate that Supersoul as present in this very body
although simultaneously apart from it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One can realize the Supersoul within oneself. He is within one's body but apart from the body, or
transcendental to the body. Although sitting in the same body as the individual soul, the Supersoul has no
affection for the body, whereas the individual soul does. One has to detach himself, therefore, from this
material body, by discharging devotional service. It is clearly mentioned here (bhaktya) that one has to
execute devotional service to the Supreme. As it is stated in the First Canto, Second Chapter, of Srimad-
Bhagavatam (1.2.7), vasudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogah prayojitah. When Vasudeva, the all-pervading
Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is served in completely pure devotion, detachment from the
material world immediately begins. The purpose of Sankhya is to detach oneself from material
contamination. This can be achieved simply by devotional service to the Supreme personality of Godhead.
When one is detached from the attraction of material prosperity, one can actually concentrate his mind
upon the Supersoul. As long as the mind is distracted towards the material, there is no possibility of
concentrating one's mind and intelligence upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His partial
representation, Supersoul. In other words, one cannot concentrate one's mind and energy upon the
Supreme unless one is detached from the material world. Following detachment from the material world,
one can actually attain transcendental knowledge of the Absolute Truth. As long as one is entangled in
sense enjoyment, or material enjoyment, it is not possible to understand the Absolute Truth. This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.54). One who is freed from material contamination is joyful and can enter
into devotional service, and by devotional service he can be liberated.
In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, it is stated that one becomes joyful by discharging devotional
service. In that joyful attitude, one can understand the science of God, or Krsna consciousness; otherwise
it is not possible. The analytical study of the elements of material nature and the concentration of the
mind upon the Supersoul are the sum and substance of the Sankhya philosophical system. The perfection
of this sankhya-yoga culminates in devotional service unto the Absolute Truth.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Twenty-sixth Chapter, of the Srimad-
Bhagavatam, entitled "Fundamental Principles of Material Nature."
Chapter Twenty-seven
