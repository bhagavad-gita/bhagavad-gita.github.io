<h2>Text</h2>
daivadhinesu kamesu
daivadhinah svayam puman
ko visrambheta yogena
yogesvaram anuvratah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
daiva--supernatural; adhinesu--being controlled; kamesu--in sense enjoyment; daiva-adhinah--
controlled by supernatural force; svayam--himself; puman--living entity; kah--whoever; visrambheta--can
have faith in; yogena--by devotional service; yogesvaram--the Supreme Lord; anuvratah--serving.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Every living entity is controlled by a supernatural force, and thus his sense enjoyment is also under the
control of that supernatural force. No one, therefore, can put his faith in Lord Krsna's transcendental
sense activities but one who has become a devotee of the Lord by rendering devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita no one can understand the transcendental birth and activities of the Lord.
The same fact is herein corroborated: no one but one who is enlightened by the devotional service of the
Lord can understand the difference between the Lord's activities and those of others, who are controlled
by the supernatural force. The sense enjoyment of all animals, men and demigods within the purview of
the material universe is controlled by the supernatural force called the prakrti, or daivi-maya. No one is
independent in obtaining sense enjoyment, and everyone in this material world is after sense enjoyment.
Persons who are themselves under the control of supernatural power cannot believe that Lord Krsna is
not under any control beyond Himself in the matter of sense enjoyment. They cannot understand that His
senses are transcendental. In the Brahma-samhita the Lord's senses are described as omnipotent; i.e., with
any sense He can perform the activities of the other senses. One who has limited senses cannot believe
that the Lord can eat by His transcendental power of hearing and can perform the act of sex life simply by
seeing. The controlled living entity cannot even dream of such sense activities in his conditional life. But
simply by the activities of bhakti-yoga, he can understand that the Lord and His activities are always
transcendental. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi
tattvatah: one cannot know even a fraction of the activities of the Lord if he is not a pure devotee of the
Lord.
