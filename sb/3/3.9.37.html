<h2>Text</h2>
tubhyam mad-vicikitsayam
atma me darsito 'bahih
nalena salile mulam
puskarasya vicinvatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tubhyam--unto you; mat--Me; vicikitsayam--on your trying to know; atma--self; me--of Myself;
darsitah--exhibited; abahih--from within; nalena--through the stem; salile--in the water; mulam--root;
puskarasya--of the lotus, the primeval source; vicinvatah--contemplating.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When you were contemplating whether there was a source to the stem of the lotus of your birth and you
even entered into that stem, you could not trace out anything. But at that time I manifested My form from
within.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Personality of Godhead can be experienced only by His causeless mercy, not by mental speculation
or with the help of the material senses. Material senses cannot approach the transcendental understanding
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He can be appreciated only by submissive devotional service
when He reveals Himself before the devotee. Only by love of Godhead can one know God, and not
otherwise. The Personality of Godhead cannot be seen with the material eyes, but He can be seen from
within by spiritual eyes opened by the ointment of love of Godhead. As long as one's spiritual eyes are
closed due to the dirty covering of matter, one cannot see the Lord. But when the dirt is removed by the
process of devotional service, one can see the Lord, without a doubt. Brahma's personal endeavor to see
the root of the lotus pipe failed, but when the Lord was satisfied by his penance and devotion, He revealed
Himself from within with no external endeavor.
