TRANSLATION
The gigantic universal form is represented by three, ten and one in the sense that He is the body and the
mind and the senses, He is the dynamic force for all movements by ten kinds of life energy, and He is the
one heart where life energy is generated.
PURPORT
In Bhagavad-gita (7.4-5) it is stated that the eight elements earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence
and false ego are all products of the Lord's inferior energy, whereas the living entities, who are seen to
utilize the inferior energy, originally belong to the superior energy, the internal potency of the Lord. The
eight inferior energies work grossly and subtly, whereas the superior energy works as the central
generating force. This is experienced in the human body. The gross elements, namely, earth, etc., form the
external gross body and are like a coat, whereas the subtle mind and false ego act like the inner clothing
of the body.
The movements of the body are first generated from the heart, and all the activities of the body are made
possible by the senses, powered by the ten kinds of air within the body. The ten kinds of air are described
as follows: The main air passing through the nose in breathing is called prana. The air which passes
through the rectum as evacuated bodily air is called apana. The air which adjusts the foodstuff within the
stomach and which sometimes sounds as belching is called samana. The air which passes through the
throat and the stoppage of which constitutes suffocation is called the udana air. Aid the total air which
circulates throughout the entire body is called the vyana air. Subtler than these five airs, there are others
also. That which facilitates the opening of the eyes, mouth, etc., is called naga air. The air which increases
appetite is called krkara air. The air which helps contraction is called kurma air. The air which helps
relaxation by opening the mouth wide (in yawning) is called devadatta air, and the air which helps
sustenance is called dhananjaya air.
All these airs are generated from the center of the heart, which is one only. This central energy is
superior energy of the Lord, who is seated within the heart with the soul of the body, who acts under the
guidance of the Lord. This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (15.15) as follows:
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto
mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca
vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
vedanta-krd veda-vid eva caham
The complete central force is generated from the heart by the Lord, who is seated there and who helps
the conditioned soul in remembering and forgetting. The conditioned state is due to the soul's
forgetfulness of his relationship of subordination to the Lord. One who wants to continue to forget the
Lord is helped by the Lord to forget Him birth after birth, but one who remembers Him, by dint of
association with a devotee of the Lord, is helped to remember Him more and more. Thus the conditioned
soul can ultimately go back home, back to Godhead.
This process of transcendental help by the Lord is described in Bhagavad-gita (10.10) as follows:
tesam satata-yuktanam
bhajatam priti-purvakam
dadami buddhi-yogam tam
yena mam upayanti te
The buddhi-yoga process of self-realization with intelligence transcendental to the mind (devotional
service) can alone elevate one from the conditioned state of material entanglement in the cosmic
construction. The conditioned state of the living entity is like that of a person who is within the depths of
a huge mechanical arrangement. The mental speculators can reach the point of buddhi-yoga after many,
many lifetimes of speculation, but the intelligent person who begins from the platform of intelligence
above the mind makes rapid progress in self-realization. Because the buddhi-yoga process entails no fear
of deterioration or retrogression at any time, it is the guaranteed path to self-realization, as confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita (2.40). The mental speculators cannot understand that the two birds (Svetasvatara
Upanisad) sitting in one tree are the soul and the Supersoul. The individual soul eats the fruit of the tree,
while the other bird does not eat the fruit but only observes the activities of the eating bird. Without
attachment, the witnessing bird helps the fruit-eating bird perform fruitful activities. One who cannot
understand this difference between the soul and the Supersoul, or God and the living entities, is certainly
still in the entanglement of the cosmic machinery and thus must still await the time when he will be free
from bondage.
