TRANSLATION
After arriving there, all of them took bath, and with the water of this place of pilgrimage they offered
their respects to the forefathers, demigods and great sages and thus satisfied them. They gave cows to the
brahmanas in royal charity.
PURPORT
Amongst the devotees of the Lord there are several divisions, mainly nitya-siddhas and sadhana-siddhas.
The nitya-siddha devotees never fall down to the region of the material atmosphere, even though they
sometimes come onto the material plane to execute the mission of the Lord. The sadhana-siddha devotees
are chosen from the conditioned souls. Out of the sadhana devotees, there are mixed and pure devotees.
The mixed devotees are sometimes enthusiastic about fruitive activities and are habituated to
philosophical speculation. The pure devotees are free from all these mixtures and are completely absorbed
in the service of the Lord, regardless of how and where they are situated. Pure devotees of the Lord are
not enthusiastic to put aside their service to the Lord in order to go visit holy places of pilgrimage. A great
devotee of the Lord in modern times, Sri Narottama dasa Thakura, has sung like this: "To visit holy places
of pilgrimage is another bewilderment of the mind because devotional service to the Lord at any place is
the last word in spiritual perfection."
For pure devotees of the Lord who are completely satisfied with the transcendental loving service of the
Lord, there is hardly any necessity to visit the various places of pilgrimage. But those who are not so
advanced have the prescribed duties of visiting pilgrimage sites and regularly performing the rituals. The
part of the princely order of the Yadu dynasty who went to Prabhasa performed all duties to be done in a
place of pilgrimage and offered their pious actions to their forefathers and others.
As a rule, every human being is indebted to God, the demigods, great sages, other living entities, people
in general, forefathers, etc., for various contributions received from them. Thus everyone is obliged to
repay the debt of gratitude. The Yadus who went to the Prabhasa pilgrimage site performed their duties by
distributing land, gold, and well-nourished cows in royal charity, as described in the following verse.
