ayata-yamas tasyasan
yamah svantara-yapanah
srnvato dhyayato visnoh
kurvato bruvatah kathah
SYNONYMS
ayata-yamah--time never lost; tasya--of Manu; asan--were; yamah--the hours; sva-antara--his duration of
life; yapanah--bringing to an end; srnvatah--hearing; dhyayatah--contemplating; visnoh--of Lord Visnu;
kurvatah--acting; bruvatah--speaking; kathah--the topics.
TRANSLATION
Consequently, although his duration of life gradually came to an end, his long life, consisting of a
Manvantara era, was not spent in vain, since he ever engaged in hearing, contemplating, writing down and
chanting the pastimes of the Lord.
PURPORT
As freshly prepared food is very tasteful but if kept for three or four hours becomes stale and tasteless,
so the existence of material enjoyment can endure as long as life is fresh, but at the fag end of life
everything becomes tasteless, and everything appears to be vain and painful. The life of Emperor
Svayambhuva Manu, however, was not tasteless; as he grew older, his life remained as fresh as in the
beginning because of his continued Krsna consciousness. The life of a man in Krsna consciousness is
always fresh. It is said that the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening and its business is to
reduce the duration of everyone's life. But the sunrise and sunset cannot diminish the life of one who
engages in Krsna consciousness. Svayambhuva Manu's life did not become stale after some time, for he
engaged himself always in chanting about and meditating upon Lord Visnu. He was the greatest yogi
because he never wasted his time. It is especially mentioned here, visnoh kurvato bruvatah kathah. When
he talked, he talked only of Krsna and Visnu, the Personality of Godhead; when he heard something, it
was about Krsna; when he meditated, it was upon Krsna and His activities.
It is stated that his life was very long, seventy-one yugas. One yuga is completed in 4,320,000 years,
seventy-one of such yugas is the duration of the life of a Manu, and fourteen such Manus come and go in
one years--Manu engaged in Krsna consciousness by chanting, hearing, talking about and meditating
upon Krsna. Therefore, his life was not wasted, nor did it become stale.
