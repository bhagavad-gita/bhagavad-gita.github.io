<h2>Text</h2>
samyag-darsanaya buddhya
yoga-vairagya-yuktaya
maya-viracite loke
caren nyasya kalevaram
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
samyak-darsanaya--endowed with right vision; buddhya--through reason; yoga--by devotional service;
vairagya--by detachment; yuktaya--strengthened; maya-viracite--arranged by maya; loke--to this world;
caret--one should move about; nyasya--relegating; kalevaram--the body.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Endowed with right vision and strengthened by devotional service and a pessimistic attitude towards
material identity, one should relegate his body to this illusory world through his reason. Thus one can be
unconcerned with this material world.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is sometimes misunderstood that if one has to associate with persons engaged in devotional service,
he will not be able to solve the economic problem. To answer this argument, it is described here that one
has to associate with liberated persons not directly, physically, but by understanding, through philosophy
and logic, the problems of life. It is stated here, samyag-darsanaya buddhya: one has to see perfectly, and
by intelligence and yogic practice one has to renounce this world. That renunciation can be achieved by
the process recommended in the Second Chapter of the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
The devotee's intelligence is always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His attitude
towards the material existence is one of detachment, for he knows perfectly well that this material world
is a creation of illusory energy. Realizing himself to be part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, the devotee
discharges his devotional service and is completely aloof from material action and reaction. Thus at the
end he gives up his material body, or the material energy, and as pure soul he enters the kingdom of God.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Thirty-first Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Lord Kapila's Instructions on the Movements of the Living Entities."
Chapter Thirty-two
