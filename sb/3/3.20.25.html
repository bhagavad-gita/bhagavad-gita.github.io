<h2>Text</h2>
sa upavrajya varadam
prapannarti-haram harim
anugrahaya bhaktanam
anurupatma-darsanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--Lord Brahma; upavrajya--approaching; vara-dam--the bestower of all boons; prapanna--of those
taking shelter at His lotus feet; arti--distress; haram--who dispels; harim--Lord Sri Hari; anugrahaya--for
showing mercy; bhaktanam--to His devotees; anurupa--in suitable forms; atma-darsanam--who manifests
Himself.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He approached the Personality of Godhead, who bestows all boons and who dispels the agony of His
devotees and of those who take shelter of His lotus feet. He manifests His innumerable transcendental
forms for the satisfaction of His devotees.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the words bhaktanam anurupatma-darsanam mean that the Personality of Godhead manifests His
multiforms according to the desires of the devotees. For example, Hanumanji (Vajrangaji) wanted to see
the form of the Lord as the Personality of Godhead Ramacandra, whereas other Vaisnavas want to see the
form of Radha-Krsna, and still other devotees want to see the Lord in the form of Laksmi-Narayana. The
Mayavadi philosophers think that although all these forms are assumed by the Lord just as the devotees
desire to see Him, actually He is impersonal. From Brahma-samhita, however, we can understand that this
is not so, for the Lord has multiforms. It is said in the Brahma-samhita, advaitam acyutam. The Lord does
not appear before the devotee because of the devotee's imagination. Brahma-samhita further explains that
the Lord has innumerable forms: ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan. He exists in millions and
millions of forms. There are Lord are innumerable. In the Bhagavatam it is stated that as the waves in the
sea cannot be counted but appear and disappear continually, the incarnations and forms of the Lord are
innumerable. A devotee is attached to a particular form, and it is that form which he worships. We have
just described the first appearance of the boar within this universe. There are innumerable universes, and
somewhere or other the boar form is now existing. All the forms of the Lord are eternal. It is the devotee's
inclination to worship a particular form, and he engages in devotional service to that form. In a verse in
the Ramayana, Hanuman, the great devotee of Rama, said, "I know that there is no difference between the
Sita-Rama and Laksmi-Narayana forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but nevertheless, the form
of Rama and Sita has absorbed my affection and love. Therefore I want to see the Lord in the forms of
Rama and Sita." Similarly, the Gaudiya Vaisnava loves the forms of Radha and Krsna, and Krsna and
Rukmini at Dvaraka. The words bhaktanam anurupatma-darsanam mean that the Lord is always pleased
to favor the devotee in the particular form in which the devotee wants to worship and render service unto
Him. In this verse it is stated that Brahma approached Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This
form of the Lord is Ksirodakasayi Visnu. Whenever there is some trouble and Brahma has to approach the
Lord, he can approach Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and it is the grace of the Lord that whenever Brahma
approaches about disturbances in the universe, the Lord gives him relief in so many ways.
