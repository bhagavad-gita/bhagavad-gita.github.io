<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
manye 'suran bhagavatams tryadhise
samrambha-margabhinivista-cittan
ye samyuge 'caksata tarksya-putram
amse sunabhayudham apatantam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
manye--I think; asuran--the demons; bhagavatan--great devotees; tri-adhise--unto the Lord of the threes;
samrambha--enmity; marga--by the way of; abhinivista-cittan--absorbed in thought; ye--those; samyuge--
in the fight; acaksata--could see; tarksya-putram--Garuda, the carrier of the Lord; amse--on the shoulder;
sunabha--the wheel; ayudham--one who carries the weapon; apatantam--coming forward.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I consider the demons, who are inimical toward the Lord, to be more than the devotees because while
fighting with the Lord, absorbed in thoughts of enmity, they are able to see the Lord carried on the
shoulder of Garuda, the son of Tarksya [Kasyapa], and carrying the wheel weapon in His hand.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The asuras who fought against the Lord face to face got salvation due to their being killed by the Lord.
This salvation of the demons is not due to their being devotees of the Lord; it is because of the Lord's
causeless mercy. Anyone who is slightly in touch with the Lord, somehow or other, is greatly benefited,
even to the point of salvation, due to the excellence of the Lord. He is so kind that He awards salvation
even to His enemies because they come into contact with Him and are indirectly absorbed in Him by their
inimical thoughts. Actually, the demons can never be equal to the pure devotees, but Uddhava was
thinking in that way because of his feelings of separation. He was thinking that at the last stage of his life
he might not be able to see the Lord face to face as did the demons. The fact is that the devotees who are
always engaged in the devotional service of the Lord in transcendental love are rewarded many hundreds
and thousands of times more than the demons by being elevated to the spiritual planets, where they
remain with the Lord in eternal, blissful existence. The demons and impersonalists are awarded the
facility of merging in the brahmajyoti effulgence of the Lord, whereas the devotees are admitted into the
spiritual planets. For comparison, one can just imagine the difference between floating in space and
residing in one of the planets in the sky. The pleasure of the living entities on the planets is greater than
that of those who have no body and who merge with the molecules of the sun's rays. The impersonalists,
therefore, are no more favored than the enemies of the Lord; rather, they are both on the same level of
spiritual salvation.
