maitreya uvaca
sva-sambhavam nisamyaivam
tapo-vidya-samadhibhih
yavan mano-vacah stutva
virarama sa khinnavat
SYNONYMS
maitreyah uvaca--the great sage Maitreya said; sva-sambhavam--the source of his appearance; nisamya--
by seeing; evam--thus; tapah--penance; vidya--knowledge; samadhibhih--as also by concentration of the
mind; yavat--as far as possible; manah--mind; vacah--words; stutva--having prayed; virarama--became
silent; sah--he (Brahma); khinna-vat--as if tired.
TRANSLATION
The sage Maitreya said: O Vidura, after observing the source of his appearance, namely the Personality
of Godhead, Brahma prayed for His mercy as far as his mind and words would permit him. Thus having
prayed, he became silent, as if tired from his activities of penance, knowledge and mental concentration.
PURPORT
Brahma's enlightenment in knowledge was due to the Lord sitting within his heart. After being created,
Brahma could not ascertain the source of his appearance, but after penance and mental concentration he
could see the source of his birth, and thus he became enlightened through his heart. The spiritual master
outside and the spiritual master within are both representations of the Lord. Unless one has contact with
such bona fide representations, one cannot claim to be a spiritual master. Lord Brahma had no
opportunity to take the help of a spiritual master from outside because at that time Brahma himself was
the only creature in the universe. Therefore, on becoming satisfied by the prayers of Brahma, the Lord
enlightened him about everything from within.
TEXTS 27-28

brahmano madhusudanah
visanna-cetasam tena
kalpa-vyatikarambhasa
loka-samsthana-vijnana
atmanah parikhidyatah
tam ahagadhaya vaca

SYNONYMS
atha--thereupon; abhipretam--intention; anviksya--observing; brahmanah--of Brahma; madhusudanah--
the killer of the Madhu demon; visanna--depressed; cetasam--of the heart; tena--by him; kalpa--
millennium; vyatikara-ambhasa--devastating water; loka-samsthana--situation of the planetary system;
vijnane--in the science; atmanah--of himself; parikhidyatah--sufficiently anxious; tam--unto him; aha--
said; agadhaya--deeply thoughtful; vaca--by words; kasmalam--impurities; samayan--removing; iva--like
that.
TRANSLATION
The Lord saw that Brahma was very anxious about the planning and construction of the different
planetary systems and was depressed upon seeing the devastating water. He could understand the
intention of Brahma, and thus He spoke in deep, thoughtful words, removing all the illusion that had
arisen.
PURPORT
The devastating water was so fearful that even Brahma was perturbed at its appearance and became very
anxious about how to situate the different planetary systems in outer space to accommodate the different
kinds of living entities, such as the human beings, those lower than the human beings, and the
superhuman beings. All the planets in the universe are situated according to the different grades of living
entities under the influence of the modes of material nature. There are three modes of material nature,
and when they are mixed with one another they become nine. When the nine are mixed they become
eighty-one, and the eighty-one also become mixed, and thus we ultimately do not know how the delusion
increases and increases. Lord Brahma had to accommodate different places and situations for the requisite
bodies of the conditioned souls. The task was meant only for Brahma, and no one in the universe can even
understand how difficult it was. But by the grace of the Lord, Brahma was able to execute the tremendous
task so perfectly that everyone is amazed to see the workmanship of the vidhata, or the regulator.
