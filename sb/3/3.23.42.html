<h2>Text</h2>
kim durapadanam tesam
pumsam uddama-cetasam
yair asritas tirtha-padas
carano vyasanatyayah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kim--what; durapadanam--difficult to achieve; tesam--for those; pumsam--men; uddama-cetasam--who
are determined; yaih--by whom; asritah--taken refuge; tirtha-padah--of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead; caranah--feet; vyasana-atyayah--which vanquish dangers.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
What is difficult to achieve for determined men who have taken refuge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead's lotus feet? His feet are the source of sacred rivers like the Ganges, which put an end to the
dangers of mundane life.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words yair asritas tirtha-padas caranah are significant here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is
known as tirtha-pada. The Ganges is called a sacred river because it emanates from the toe of Visnu. The
Ganges is meant to eradicate all the material distresses of the conditioned souls. For any living entity,
therefore, who has taken shelter of the holy lotus feet of the Lord, nothing is impossible. Kardama Muni is
special not because he was a great mystic, but because he was a great devotee. Therefore it is said here
that for a great devotee like Kardama Muni, nothing is impossible. Although yogis can perform wonderful
feats, as Kardama has already displayed, Kardama was more than a yogi because he was a great devotee of
the Lord; therefore he was more glorious than an ordinary yogi. As it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, "Out
of the many yogis, he who is a devotee of the Lord is first class." For a person like Kardama Muni there is
no question of being conditioned; he was already a liberated soul and better than the demigods, who are
also conditioned. Although he was enjoying with his wife and many other women, he was above material,
conditional life. Therefore the word vyasanatyayah is used to indicate that he was beyond the position of a
conditioned soul. He was transcendental to all material limitations.
