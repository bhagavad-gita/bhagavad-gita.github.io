<h2>Text</h2>
naraka-stho 'pi deham vai
na pumams tyaktum icchati
narakyam nirvrtau satyam
deva-maya-vimohitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
naraka--in hell; sthah--situated; api--even; deham--body; vai--indeed; na--not; puman--person;
tyaktum--to leave; icchati--wishes; narakyam--hellish; nirvrtau--enjoyment; satyam--when existing; devamaya--
by the illusory energy of Visnu; vimohitah--deluded.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The conditioned living entity is satisfied in his own particular species of life; while deluded by the
covering influence of the illusory energy, he feels little inclined to cast off his body, even when in hell, for
he takes delight in hellish enjoyment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said that once Indra, the King of heaven, was cursed by his spiritual master, Brhaspati, on account
of his misbehavior, and he became a hog on this planet. After many days, when Brahma wanted to recall
him to his heavenly kingdom, Indra, in the form of a hog, forgot everything of his royal position in the
heavenly kingdom, and he refused to go back. This is the spell of maya. Even Indra forgets his heavenly
standard of life and is satisfied with the standard of a hog's life. By the influence of maya the conditioned
soul becomes so affectionate towards his particular type of body that if he is offered, "Give up this body,
and immediately you will have a king's body," he will not agree. This attachment strongly affects all
conditioned living entities. Lord Krsna is personally canvassing, "Give up everything in this material
world. Come to Me, and I shall give you all protection," but we are not agreeable. We think, "We are
quite all right. Why should we surrender unto Krsna and go back to His kingdom?" This is called illusion,
or maya. Everyone is satisfied with his standard of living, however abominable it may be.
