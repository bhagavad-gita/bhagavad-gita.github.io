<h2>Text</h2>
desatah kalato yo 'sav
avasthatah svato 'nyatah
aviluptavabodhatma
sa yujyetajaya katham
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
desatah--circumstantial; kalatah--by the influence of time; yah--one who; asau--the living entity;
avasthatah--by situation; svatah--by dream; anyatah--by others; avilupta--extinct; avabodha--
consciousness; atma--pure self; sah--he; yujyeta--engaged; ajaya--with nescience; katham--how is it so.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The pure soul is pure consciousness and is never out of consciousness, either due to circumstances,
time, situations, dreams or other causes. How then does he become engaged in nescience?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The consciousness of the living being is always present and never changes under any circumstances, as
above mentioned. When a living man moves from one place to another, he is conscious that he has
changed his position. He is always present in the past, present and future, like electricity. One can
remember incidents from his past and can conjecture about his future also on the basis of past experience.
He never forgets his personal identity, even though he is placed in awkward circumstances. How then can
the living entity become forgetful of his real identity as pure spirit soul and identify with matter unless
influenced by something beyond himself? The conclusion is that the living entity is influenced by the
avidya potency, as confirmed in both the Visnu Purana and the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam. The
living entity is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (7.5) as para prakrti, and in the Visnu Purana he is mentioned
as the para sakti. He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord as potency and not as the potent. The potent
can exhibit many potencies, but the potency cannot equal the potent at any stage. One potency may be
overcome by another potency, but to the potent, all potencies are under control. The jiva potency, or the
ksetrajna-sakti of the Lord, has the tendency to be overpowered by the external potency, avidya-karmasamjna,
and in this way he is placed in the awkward circumstances of material existence. The living entity
cannot be forgetful of his real identity unless influenced by the avidya potency. Because the living entity is
prone to the influence of the avidya potency, he can never equal the supreme potent.
