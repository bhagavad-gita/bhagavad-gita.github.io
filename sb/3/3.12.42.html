<h2>Translation</h2>
Then the thread ceremony for the twice-born was inaugurated, as were the rules to be followed for at
least one year after acceptance of the Vedas, rules for observing complete abstinence from sex life,
vocations in terms of Vedic injunctions, various professional duties in household life, and the method of
maintaining a livelihood without anyone's cooperation by picking up rejected grains.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
During student life the brahmacaris were given full instructions about the importance of the human
form of life. Thus the basic education was designed to encourage the student in becoming free from family
encumbrances. Only students unable to accept such a vow in life were allowed to go home and marry a
suitable wife. Otherwise, the student would remain a permanent brahmacari, observing complete
abstinence from sex life for his whole life. It all depended on the quality of the student's training. We had
the opportunity to meet an avowed brahmacari in the personality of our spiritual master, Om Visnupada
Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Gosvami Maharaja. Such a great soul is called a naisthika-brahmacari.
