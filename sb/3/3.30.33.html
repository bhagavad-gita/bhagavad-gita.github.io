kevalena hy adharmena
kutumba-bharanotsukah
yati jivo 'ndha-tamisram
caramam tamasah padam
SYNONYMS
kevalena--simply; hi--certainly; adharmena--by irreligious activities; kutumba--family; bharana--to
maintain; utsukah--eager; yati--goes; jivah--a person; andha-tamisram--to Andha-tamisra; caramam--
ultimate; tamasah--of darkness; padam--region.
TRANSLATION
Therefore a person who is very eager to maintain his family and kinsmen simply by black methods
certainly goes to the darkest region of hell, which is known as Andha-tamisra.
PURPORT
Three words in this verse are very significant. Kevalena means "only by black methods," adharmena
means "unrighteous" or "irreligious," and kutumba-bharana means "family maintenance." Maintaining
one's family is certainly the duty of a householder, but one should be eager to earn his livelihood by the
prescribed method, as stated in the scriptures. In Bhagavad-gita it is described that the Lord has divided
the social system into four classifications of castes, or varnas, according to quality and work. Apart from
Bhagavad-gita, in every society a man is known according to his quality and work. For example, when a
man is constructing wooden furniture, he is called a carpenter, and a man who works with an anvil and
iron is called a blacksmith. Similarly, a man who is engaged in the medical or engineering fields has a
particular duty and designation. All these human activities have been divided by the Supreme Lord into
four varnas, namely brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra. In Bhagavad-gita and in other Vedic literatures,
the specific duties of the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra are mentioned.
One should work honestly according to his qualification. He should not earn his livelihood unfairly, by
means for which he is not qualified. If a brahmana who works as a priest so that he may enlighten his
followers with the spiritual way of life is not qualified as a priest, then he is cheating the public. One
should not earn by such unfair means. The same is applicable to a ksatriya or to a vaisya. It is especially
mentioned that the means of livelihood of those who are trying to advance in Krsna consciousness must
be very fair and uncomplicated. Here it is mentioned that he who earns his livelihood by unfair means
(kevalena) is sent to the darkest hellish region. Otherwise, if one maintains his family by prescribed
methods and honest means, there is no objection to one's being a family man.
