the plea, by such a show; kalena--by the eternal time; amogha--unfailing; vanchitah--one who so desires;
samhrtya--closing; sva-kulam--own family; sphitam--excessively numerous; tyaksyan--after giving up;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami replied: My dear King, the cursing of the brahmanas was only a plea, but the actual
fact was the supreme desire of the Lord. He wanted to disappear from the face of the earth after
dispatching His excessively numerous family members. He thought to Himself as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse the word tyaksyan is very significant in relation to Lord Sri Krsna's leaving His body. Since
He is the eternal form of existence, knowledge and bliss, His body and His Self are identical. Therefore
how is it possible that He would leave His body and then disappear from the vision of the world? There is
a great controversy amongst the nondevotees or Mayavadis about the mysterious disappearance of the
Lord, and the doubts of those men with a poor fund of knowledge have been very elaborately cleared by
Srila Jiva Gosvami in his Krsna-sandarbha.
According to Brahma-samhita, the Lord has many forms. It is stated therein that the Lord has
innumerable forms, and when He appears within the vision of the living entities, as Lord Krsna actually
appeared, all such forms amalgamate with Him. Besides all these infallible forms, He has His universal
form, as manifested before Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra. Here in this verse the word sphitam is
also used, which indicates that He left His gigantic universal form called the virat-rupa, not His primeval,
eternal form, because there is hardly any possibility of His changing His form of sac-cid-ananda. This
simple understanding is at once realized by the devotees of the Lord, but those who are nondevotees, who
perform hardly any devotional service to the Lord, either do not understand this simple fact or purposely
raise a controversy to defeat the eternity of the transcendental body of the Lord. This is due to the defect
called the cheating propensity of the imperfect living entities.
By practical experience also, it is seen, up to the present day, that the Lord's transcendental form is
worshiped by devotees in different temples, and all the devotees of the Lord factually realize that the form
of the Deity in the temple is nondifferent from the form of the Lord. This inconceivable performance of
the internal potency of the Lord is described in Bhagavad-gita (7.25): naham prakasah sarvasya yogamaya-
samavrtah. The Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to everyone. In the padma purana it is
said, atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih. The name and form of the Lord cannot be
perceived by the material senses, but when He appears within the vision of the mundane people He
assumes the form of the virat-rupa. This is an additional material exhibition of form and is supported by
the logic of a subject and its adjectives. In grammar, when an adjective is taken away from the subject, the
subject it modifies does not change. Similarly, when the Lord quits His virat-rupa, His eternal form does
not change, although there is no material difference between Himself and any one of His innumerable
forms. In the Fifth Canto it will be seen how the Lord is worshiped in different planets in His different
forms, even now, and how He is worshiped in different temples of this earth also.
Srila Jiva Gosvami and Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura have very elaborately explained this
incident of the Lord's disappearance in their commentaries, quoting various authentic versions of Vedic
literatures. We purposely do not include them all here to avoid an increase in the volume of this book.
The entire matter is explained in Bhagavad-gita, as quoted above: the Lord reserves the right of not being
exposed to everyone. He always keeps Himself out of the vision of the nondevotees, who are devoid of
love and devotion, and thus He puts them still further away from the Lord. The Lord appeared on the
invitation of Brahma, who prayed before the Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and therefore when the Lord appeared,
all the forms of Visnu amalgamated with Him, and when the mission was fulfilled, all of them
disintegrated from Him in the usual course.
