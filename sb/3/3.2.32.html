<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Lord, Krsna, desired to utilize the opulent financial strength of Maharaja Nanda for
worship of the cows, and also He wanted to give a lesson to Indra, the King of heaven. Thus He advised
His father to perform worship of go, or the pasturing land and the cows, with the help of learned
brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Since He is the teacher of everyone, the Lord also taught His father, Nanda Maharaja. Nanda Maharaja
was a well-to-do landholder and owner of many cows, and, as was the custom, he used to perform yearly
worship of Indra, the King of heaven, with great opulence. This worship of demigods by the general
populace is also advised in the Vedic literature just so people can accept the superior power of the Lord.
The demigods are servants of the Lord deputed to look after the management of various activities of
universal affairs. Therefore it is advised in the Vedic scriptures that one should perform yajnas to appease
the demigods. But one who is devoted to the Supreme Lord has no need to appease the demigods.
Worship of the demigods by common people is an arrangement for acknowledging the supremacy of the
Supreme Lord, but it is not necessary. Such appeasement is generally recommended for material gains
only. As we have already discussed in the Second Canto of this literature, one who admits the supremacy
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to worship the secondary demigods. Sometimes,
being worshiped and adored by less intelligent living beings, the demigods become puffed up with power
and forget the supremacy of the Lord. This happened when Lord Krsna was present in the universe, and
thus the Lord wanted to give a lesson to the King of heaven, Indra. He therefore asked Maharaja Nanda to
stop the sacrifice offered to Indra and to use the money properly by performing a ceremony worshiping
the cows and the pasturing ground on the hill of Govardhana. By this act Lord Krsna taught human
society, as He has instructed in the Bhagavad-gita also, that one should worship the Supreme Lord by all
acts and by all their results. That will bring about the desired success. The vaisyas are specifically advised
to give protection to the cows and their pasturing ground or agricultural land instead of squandering their
hard-earned money. That will satisfy the Lord. The perfection of one's occupational duty, whether in the
sphere of duty to oneself, one's community or one's nation, is judged by the degree to which the Lord is
satisfied.
