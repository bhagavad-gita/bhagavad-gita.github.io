paravaresam prakrtim
asyotpatty-anta-bhavanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
surya-dvarena--through the path of illumination; te--they; yanti--approach; purusam--the Personality of
Godhead; visvatah-mukham--whose face is turned everywhere; para-avara-isam--the proprietor of the
spiritual and material worlds; prakrtim--the material cause; asya--of the world; utpatti--of manifestation;
anta--of dissolution; bhavanam--the cause.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Through the path of illumination, such liberated persons approach the complete Personality of
Godhead, who is the proprietor of the material and spiritual worlds and is the supreme cause of their
manifestation and dissolution.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word surya-dvarena means "by the illuminated path," or through the sun planet. The illuminated
path is devotional service. It is advised in the Vedas not to pass through the darkness, but to pass through
the sun planet. It is also recommended here that by traversing the illuminated path one can be freed from
the contamination of the material modes of nature; by that path one can enter into the kingdom where the
completely perfect Personality of Godhead resides. The words purusam visvato-mukham mean the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is all-perfect. All living entities other than the Supreme Personality
of Godhead are very small, although they may be big by our calculation. Everyone is infinitesimal, and
therefore in the Vedas the Supreme Lord is called the supreme eternal amongst all eternals. He is the
proprietor of the material and spiritual worlds and the supreme cause of manifestation. Material nature is
only the ingredient because actually the manifestation is caused by His energy. The material energy is also
His energy; just as the combination of father and mother is the cause of childbirth, so the combination of
the material energy and the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the
manifestation of the material world. The efficient cause, therefore, is not matter, but the Lord Himself.
