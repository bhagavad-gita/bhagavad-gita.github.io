<h2>Text</h2>
tat praticcha dvijagryemam
sraddhayopahrtam maya
sarvatmananurupam te
grhamedhisu karmasu
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat--therefore; praticcha--please accept; dvija-agrya--O best of the brahmanas; imam--her; sraddhaya--
with faith; upahrtam--offered as a presentation; maya--by me; sarva-atmana--in every way; anurupam--
suitable; te--for you; grha-medhisu--in the household; karmasu--duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore please accept her, O chief of the brahmanas, for I offer her with faith and she is in every
respect fit to be your wife and take charge of your household duties.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The words grhamedhisu karmasu mean "in household duties." Another word is also used here:
sarvatmananurupam. The purport is that a wife should not only be equal to her husband in age, character
and qualities, but must be helpful to him in his household duties. The household duty of a man is not to
satisfy his sense gratification, but to remain with a wife and children and at the same time attain
advancement in spiritual life. One who does not do so is not a householder but a grhamedhi. Two words
are used in Sanskrit literature; one is grhastha, and the other is grhamedhi. The difference between
grhamedhi and grhastha is that grhastha is also an asrama, or spiritual order, but if one simply satisfies his
senses as a householder, then he is a grhamedhi. For a grhamedhi, to accept a wife means to satisfy the
senses, but for a grhastha a qualified wife is an assistant in every respect for advancement in spiritual
activities. It is the duty of the wife to take charge of household affairs and not to compete with the
husband. A wife is meant to help, but she cannot help her husband unless he is completely equal to her in
age, character and quality.
