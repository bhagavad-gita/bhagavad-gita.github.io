<h2>Text</h2>
yam ahur atmano hy ardham
sreyas-kamasya manini
yasyam sva-dhuram adhyasya
pumams carati vijvarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yam--the wife who; ahuh--is said; atmanah--of the body; hi--thus; ardham--half; sreyah--welfare;
kamasya--of all desires; manini--O respectful one; yasyam--in whom; sva-dhuram--all responsibilities;
adhyasya--entrusting; puman--a man; carati--moves; vijvarah--without anxiety.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O respectful one, a wife is so helpful that she is called the better half of a man's body because of her
sharing in all auspicious activities. A man can move without anxiety entrusting all responsibilities to his
wife.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By the Vedic injunction, the wife is accepted as the better half of a man's body because she is supposed
to be responsible for discharging half of the duties of the husband. A family man has a responsibility to
perform five kinds of sacrifices, called panca-yajna, in order to get relief from all kinds of unavoidable
sinful reaction incurred in the course of his affairs. When a man becomes qualitatively like the cats and
dogs, he forgets his duties in cultivating spiritual values, and thus he accepts his wife as a sense
gratificatory agency. When the wife is accepted as a sense gratificatory agency, personal beauty is the main
consideration, and as soon as there is a break in personal sense gratification, there is disruption or
divorce. But when husband and wife aim at spiritual advancement by mutual cooperation, there is no
consideration of personal beauty or the disruption of so-called love. In the material world there is no
question of love. Marriage is actually a duty performed in mutual cooperation as directed in the
authoritative scriptures for spiritual advancement. Therefore marriage is essential in order to avoid the life
of cats and dogs, who are not meant for spiritual enlightenment.
