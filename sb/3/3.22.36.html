<h2>Text</h2>
sa evam svantaram ninye
yuganam eka-saptatim
vasudeva-prasangena
paribhuta-gati-trayah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--he (Svayambhuva Manu); evam--thus; sva-antaram--his own period; ninye--passed; yuganam--of
the cycles of four ages; eka-saptatim--seventy-one; vasudeva--with Vasudeva; prasangena--by topics
connected; paribhuta--transcended; gati-trayah--the three destinations.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He passed his time, which lasted seventy-one cycles of the four ages [71 x 4,320,000 years], always
thinking of Vasudeva and always engaged in matters regarding Vasudeva. Thus he transcended the three
destinations.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The three destinations are meant for persons who are under the control of the three modes of material
nature. These destinations are sometimes described as the awakened, dreaming and unconscious stages.
In Bhagavad-gita the three destinations are described as the destinations of persons in the modes of
goodness, passion and ignorance. It is stated in the Gita that those who are in the mode of goodness are
promoted to better living conditions in higher planets, and those who are in the mode of passion remain
within this material world on the earth or on heavenly planets, but those who are in the mode of
ignorance are degraded to an animal life on planets where life is lower than human. But one who is Krsna
conscious is above these three modes of material nature. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that anyone who
engages in devotional service to the Lord automatically becomes transcendental to the three destinations
of material nature and is situated in the brahma-bhuta, or self-realized, stage. Although Svayambhuva
Manu, the ruler of this material world, appeared to be absorbed in material happiness, he was neither in
the mode of goodness nor in the modes of passion or ignorance, but in the transcendental stage.
Therefore, one who fully engages in devotional service is always liberated. Bilvamangala Thakura, a
great devotee of the Lord, stated: "If I have unflinching devotion to the lotus feet of Krsna, then Mother
Liberation is always engaged in my service. The complete perfection of material enjoyment, religion and
economic development is at my command." People are after dharma, artha, kama and moksa. Generally
they perform religious activities to achieve some material gain, and they engage in material activity for
sense gratification. After being frustrated in material sense gratification, one wants to be liberated and
become one with the Absolute Truth. These four principles form the transcendental path for the less
intelligent. Those who are actually intelligent engage in Krsna consciousness, not caring for these four
principles of the transcendental method. They at once elevate themselves to the transcendental platform
which is above liberation. Liberation is not a very great achievement for a devotee, to say nothing of the
results of ritualistic performances in religion, economic development or the materialistic life of sense
gratification. Devotees do not care for these. They are situated always on the transcendental platform of
the brahma-bhuta stage of self-realization.
