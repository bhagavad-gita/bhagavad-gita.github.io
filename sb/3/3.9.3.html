<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, I do not see a form superior to Your present form of eternal bliss and knowledge. In Your
impersonal Brahman effulgence in the spiritual sky, there is no occasional change and no deterioration of
internal potency. I surrender unto You because whereas I am proud of my material body and senses, Your
Lordship is the cause of the cosmic manifestation and yet You are untouched by matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: the Supreme
Personality of Godhead can only be partially known, and only by the process of devotional service to the
Lord. Lord Brahma became aware that the Supreme Lord Krsna has many, many eternal, blissful forms of
knowledge. He has described such expansions of the Supreme Lord, Govinda, in his Brahma-samhita
(5.33), as follows:
advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam
adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca
vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is nondual and infallible. He is the original cause of all
causes, even though He expands in many, many forms. Although He is the oldest personality, He is ever
youthful, unaffected by old age. The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be known by the academic
wisdom of the Vedas; one has to approach the devotee of the Lord to understand Him."
The only way to understand the Lord as He is, is by devotional service to the Lord, or by approaching
the devotee of the Lord who always has the Lord in his heart. By devotional perfection one can
understand that the impersonal brahmajyoti is only a partial representation of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Lord Krsna, and that the three purusa expansions in the material creation are His plenary
portions. In the spiritual sky of the brahmajyoti there is no change of various kalpas or millenniums, and
there are no creative activities in the Vaikuntha worlds. The influence of time is conspicuous by its
absence. The rays of the transcendental body of the Lord, the unlimited brahmajyoti, are undeterred by
the influence of material energy. In the material world also, the initial creator is the Lord Himself. He
brings about the creation of Brahma, who becomes the subsequent creator, empowered by the Lord.
