<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus consciously engaged in devotional service in the association of devotees, a person gains distaste for
sense gratification, both in this world and in the next, by constantly thinking about the activities of the
Lord. This process of Krsna consciousness is the easiest process of mystic power; when one is actually
situated on that path of devotional service, he is able to control the mind.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that they can enjoy sense gratification
not only in this life but also in the next. For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly
kingdom of higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association of devotees prefers
to contemplate the activities of the Lord--how He has created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how
the creation dissolves, and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord's pastimes are going on. There are full
literatures describing these activities of the Lord, especially Bhagavad-gita, Brahma-samhita and Srimad-
Bhagavatam. The sincere devotee who associates with devotees gets the opportunity to hear and
contemplate this subject of the pastimes of the Lord, and the result is that he feels distaste for so-called
happiness in this or that world, in heaven or on other planets. The devotees are simply interested in being
transferred to the personal association of the Lord; they have no more attraction for temporary so-called
happiness. That is the position of one who is yoga-yukta. One who is fixed in mystic power is not
disturbed by the allurement of this world or that world; he is interested in the matters of spiritual
understanding or the spiritual situation. This sublime situation is very easily attained by the easiest
process, bhakti-yoga. Rjubhir yoga-margaih. A very suitable word used here is rjubhih, or "very easy."
There are different processes of yoga-marga, attaining yoga perfection, but this process, devotional service
to the Lord, is the easiest. Not only is it the easiest process, but the result is sublime. Everyone, therefore,
should try to take this process of Krsna consciousness and reach the highest perfection of life.
