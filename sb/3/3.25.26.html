TRANSLATION
When Kardama Muni understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the chief of all the
demigods, Visnu, had descended, Kardama approached Him in a secluded place, offered obeisances and
spoke as follows.
PURPORT
Lord Visnu is called tri-yuga. He appears in three yugas--Satya, Treta and Dvapara--but in Kali-yuga He
does not appear. From the prayers of Prahlada Maharaja, however, we understand that He appears garbed
as a devotee in Kali-yuga. Lord Caitanya is that devotee. Krsna appeared in the form of a devotee, but
although He never disclosed Himself, Rupa Gosvami could understand His identity, for the Lord cannot
hide Himself from a pure devotee. Rupa Gosvami detected Him when he offered his first obeisances to
Lord Caitanya. He knew that Lord Caitanya was Krsna Himself and therefore offered his obeisances with
the following words: "I offer my respects to Krsna, who has now appeared as Lord Caitanya." This is also
confirmed in the prayers of Prahlada Maharaja: in Kali-yuga He does not directly appear, but He appears
as a devotee. Visnu, therefore, is known as tri-yuga. Another explanation of tri-yuga is that He has three
pairs of divine attributes, namely power and affluence, piety and renown, and wisdom and dispassion.
According to Sridhara Svami, His three pairs of opulences are complete riches and complete strength,
complete fame and complete beauty, and complete wisdom and complete renunciation. There are
different interpretations of tri-yuga, but it is accepted by all learned scholars that tri-yuga means Visnu.
When Kardama Muni understood that his son, Kapila, was Visnu Himself, he wanted to offer his
obeisances. Therefore, when Kapila was alone he offered his respects and expressed his mind as follows.
