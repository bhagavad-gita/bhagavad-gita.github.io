<h2>Translation</h2>
All the demigods from the upper, lower and middle universal planetary systems assembled at the altar of
the rajasuya sacrifice performed by Maharaja Yudhisthira. After seeing the beautiful bodily features of
Lord Krsna, they all contemplated that He was the ultimate dexterous creation of Brahma, the creator of
human beings.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There was nothing comparable to the bodily features of Lord Krsna when He was present in this world.
The most beautiful object in the material world may be compared to the blue lotus flower or the full
moon in the sky, but even the lotus flower and the moon were defeated by the beauty of the bodily
features of Lord Krsna, and this was certified by the demigods, the most beautiful living creatures in the
universe. The demigods thought that Lord Krsna, like themselves, was also created by Lord Brahma, but
in fact Brahma was created by Lord Krsna. It was not within the power of Brahma to create the
transcendental beauty of the Supreme Lord. No one is the creator of Krsna; rather, He is the creator of
everyone. As He says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate.
