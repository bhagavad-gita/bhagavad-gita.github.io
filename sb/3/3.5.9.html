<h2>Text</h2>
yena prajanam uta atma-karmarupabhidhanam
ca bhidam vyadhatta
narayano visvasrg atma-yonir
etac ca no varnaya vipra-varya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yena--by which; prajanam--of those who are born; uta--as also; atma-karma--destined engagement;
rupa--form and feature; abhidhanam--endeavors; ca--also; bhidam--differentiation; vyadhatta--dispersed;
narayanah--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; visvasrk--the creator of the universe; atma-yonih--selfsufficient;
etat--all these; ca--also; nah--unto us; varnaya--describe; vipra-varya--O chief amongst the
brahmanas.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O chief amongst the brahmanas, please also describe how Narayana, the creator of the universe and the
self-sufficient Lord, has differently created the natures, activities, forms, features and names of the
different living creatures.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Every living being is under the plan of his natural inclinations in terms of the modes of material nature.
His work is manifested in terms of the nature of the three modes, his form and bodily features are
designed according to his work, and his name is designated according to his bodily features. For example,
the higher classes of men are white (sukla), and the lower classes of men are black. This division of white
and black is in terms of one's white and black duties of life. Pious acts lead one to take birth in a good and
highly placed family, to become rich, to become learned, and to acquire beautiful bodily features. Impious
acts lead one to become poor by parentage, to be always in want, to become a fool or illiterate and to
acquire ugly bodily features. Vidura requested Maitreya to explain these differences between all the living
creatures made by Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
