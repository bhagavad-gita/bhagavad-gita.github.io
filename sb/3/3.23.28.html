tam ayantam abhipretya
brahmavartat prajah patim
gita-samstuti-vaditraih
pratyudiyuh praharsitah
SYNONYMS
tam--him; ayantam--who was arriving; abhipretya--knowing of; brahmavartat--from Brahmavarta;
prajah--his subjects; patim--their lord; gita-samstuti-vaditraih--with songs, praise and instrumental music;
pratyudiyuh--came forward to greet; praharsitah--overjoyed.
TRANSLATION
Overjoyed to know of his arrival, his subjects came forth from Brahmavarta to greet their returning lord
with songs, prayers and musical instruments.
PURPORT
It is the custom of the citizens of a kingdom's capital to receive the king when he returns from a tour.
There is a similar description when Krsna returned to Dvaraka after the Battle of Kuruksetra. At that time
He was received by all classes of citizens at the gate of the city. Formerly, capital cities were surrounded
by walls, and there were different gates for regular entrance. Even in Delhi today there are old gates, and
some other old cities have such gates where citizens would gather to receive the king. Here also the
citizens of Barhismati, the capital of Brahmavarta, the kingdom of Svayambhuva, came nicely dressed to
receive the Emperor with decorations and musical instruments.
TEXTS 29-30
barhismati nama puri
sarva-sampat-samanvita
nyapatan yatra romani
yajnasyangam vidhunvatah
kusah kasas ta evasan
sasvad-dharita-varcasah
rsayo yaih parabhavya
yajna-ghnan yajnam ijire
SYNONYMS
barhismati--Barhismati; nama--named; puri--city; sarva-sampat--all kinds of wealth; samanvita--full of;
nyapatan--fell down; yatra--where; romani--the hairs; yajnasya--of Lord Boar; angam--His body;
vidhunvatah--shaking; kusah--kusa grass; kasah--kasa grass; te--they; eva--certainly; asan--became; sasvatharita--
of evergreen; varcasah--having the color; rsayah--the sages; yaih--by which; parabhavya--defeating;
yajna-ghnan--the disturbers of the sacrificial performances; yajnam--Lord Visnu; ijire--they worshiped.
TRANSLATION
The city of Barhismati, rich in all kinds of wealth, was so called because Lord Visnu's hair dropped there
from His body when He manifested Himself as Lord Boar. As He shook His body, this very hair fell and
turned into blades of evergreen kusa grass and kasa [another kind of grass used for mats], by means of
which the sages worshiped Lord Visnu after defeating the demons who had interfered with the
performance of their sacrifices.
PURPORT
Any place directly connected with the Supreme Lord is called pitha-sthana. Barhismati, the capital of
Svayambhuva Manu, was exalted not because the city was very rich in wealth and opulence, but because
the hairs of Lord Varaha fell at this very spot. These hairs of the Lord later grew as green grass, and the
sages used to worship the Lord with that grass after the time when the Lord killed the demon Hiranyaksa.
Yajna means Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita, karma is described as
yajnartha. Yajnartha-karma means "work done only for the satisfaction of Visnu." If something is done for
sense gratification or any other purpose, it will be binding upon the worker. If one wants to be freed from
the reaction of his work, he must perform everything for the satisfaction of Visnu, or Yajna. In the capital
of Svayambhuva Manu, Barhismati, these particular functions were being performed by the great sages
and saintly persons.
