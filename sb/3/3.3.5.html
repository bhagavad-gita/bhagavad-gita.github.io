TRANSLATION
It was so observed by Vidura that Uddhava had all the transcendental bodily changes due to total
ecstasy, and he was trying to wipe away tears of separation from his eyes. Thus Vidura could understand
that Uddhava had completely assimilated extensive love for the Lord.
PURPORT
The symptoms of the highest order of devotional life were observed by Vidura, an experienced devotee
of the Lord, and he confirmed Uddhava's perfectional stage of love of Godhead. Ecstatic bodily changes
are manifested from the spiritual plane and are not artificial expressions developed by practice. There are
three different stages of development in devotional service. The first stage is that of following the
regulative principles prescribed in the codes of devotional service, the second stage is that of assimilation
and realization of the steady condition of devotional service, and the last stage is that of ecstasy
symptomized by transcendental bodily expression. The nine different modes of devotional service, such as
hearing, chanting and remembering, are the beginning of the process. By regular hearing of the glories
and pastimes of the Lord, the impurities in the student's heart begin to be washed off. The more one is
cleansed of impurities, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service. Gradually the activities take the
forms of steadiness, firm faith, taste, realization and assimilation, one after another. These different stages
of gradual development increase love of God to the highest stage, and in the highest stage there are still
more symptoms, such as affection, anger and attachment, gradually rising in exceptional cases to the
maha-bhava stage, which is generally not possible for the living entities. All these were manifested by
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the personification of love of God.
In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by Srila Rupa Gosvami, the chief disciple of Lord Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, these transcendental symptoms displayed by pure devotees like Uddhava are systematically
described. We have written a summary study of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu entitled The Nectar of Devotion,
and one may consult this book for more detailed information on the science of devotional service.
