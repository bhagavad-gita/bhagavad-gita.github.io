<h2>Translation</h2>
Saunaka continued: There is no one who knows more than the Lord Himself. No one is more
worshipable or more mature a yogi than He. He is therefore the master of the Vedas, and to hear about
Him always is the actual pleasure of the senses.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is stated that no one can be equal to or greater than the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. This is confirmed in the Vedas also: eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman. He is the supreme living
entity and is supplying the necessities of all other living entities. Thus all other living entities, both visnutattva
and jiva-tattva, are subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna. The same concept is
confirmed here. Na hy asya varsmanah pumsam: amongst the living entities, no one can surpass the
Supreme Person because no one is richer, more famous, stronger, more beautiful, wiser or more
renounced than He. These qualifications make Him the Supreme Godhead, the cause of all causes. Yogis
are very proud of performing wonderful feats, but no one can compare to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
Anyone who is associated with the Supreme Lord is accepted as a first-class yogi. Devotees may not be
as powerful as the Supreme Lord, but by constant association with the Lord they become as good as the
Lord Himself. Sometimes the devotees act more powerfully than the Lord. Of course, that is the Lord's
concession.
Also used here is the word varimnah, meaning "the most worshipful of all yogis." To hear from Krsna is
the real pleasure of the senses; therefore He is known as Govinda, for by His words, by His teachings, by
His instruction--by everything connected with Him--He enlivens the senses. Whatever He instructs is
from the transcendental platform, and His instructions, being absolute, are nondifferent from Him.
Hearing from Krsna or His expansion or plenary expansion like Kapila is very pleasing to the senses.
Bhagavad-gita can be read or heard many times, but because it gives great pleasure, the more one reads
Bhagavad-gita the more he gets the appetite to read and understand it, and each time he gets new
enlightenment. That is the nature of the transcendental message. Similarly, we find that transcendental
happiness in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The more we hear and chant the glories of the Lord, the more we
become happy.
