trai-vargikas te purusa
vimukha hari-medhasah
kathayam kathaniyoruvikramasya
madhudvisah
SYNONYMS
trai-vargikah--interested in the three elevating processes; te--those; purusah--persons; vimukhah--not
interested; hari-medhasah--of Lord Hari; kathayam--in the pastimes; kathaniya--worth chanting of; uruvikramasya--
whose excellent prowess; madhu-dvisah--the killer of the Madhu demon.
TRANSLATION
Such persons are called trai-vargika because they are interested in the three elevating processes. They
are averse to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can give relief to the conditioned soul. They are
not interested in the Supreme Personality's pastimes, which are worth hearing because of His
transcendental prowess.
PURPORT
According to Vedic thought, there are four elevating principles, namely religiosity, economic
development, sense gratification and liberation. Persons who are simply interested in material enjoyment
make plans to execute prescribed duties. They are interested in the three elevating processes of religious
rituals, economic elevation and sense enjoyment. By developing their economic condition, they can enjoy
material life. Materialistic persons, therefore, are interested in those elevating processes, which are called
trai-vargika. Trai means "three"; vargika means "elevating processes." Such materialistic persons are never
attracted by the Supreme personality of Godhead. Rather, they are antagonistic towards Him.
The Supreme personality of Godhead is here described as hari-medhah, or "He who can deliver one
from the cycle of birth and death." Materialistic persons are never interested in hearing about the
marvelous pastimes of the Lord. They think that they are fictions and stories and that the Supreme
Godhead is also a man of material nature. They are not fit for advancing in devotional service, or Krsna
consciousness. Such materialistic persons are interested in newspaper stories, novels and imaginary
dramas. The factual activities of the Lord, such as Lord Krsna's acting in the Battle of Kuruksetra, or the
activities of the Pandavas, or the Lord's activities in Vrndavana or Dvaraka, are related in the Bhagavadgita
and Srimad-Bhagavatam, which are full of the activities of the Lord. But materialistic persons who
engage in elevating their position in the material world are not interested in such activities of the Lord.
They may be interested in the activities of a great politician or a great rich man of this world, but they are
not interested in the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord.
