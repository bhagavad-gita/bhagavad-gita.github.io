<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
padbhyam--from the legs; bhagavatah--of the Personality of Godhead; jajne--became manifested;
susrusa--service; dharma--occupational duty; siddhaye--for the matter of; tasyam--in that; jatah--being
generated; pura--formerly; sudrah--the servitors; yat-vrttya--the occupation by which; tusyate--becomes
satisfied; harih--the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter, service was manifested from the legs of the Personality of Godhead for the sake of perfecting
the religious function. Situated on the legs are the sudras, who satisfy the Lord by service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Service is the real constitutional occupation of all living entities. The living entities are meant to render
service to the Lord, and they can attain religious perfection by this service attitude. One cannot attain
religious perfection simply by speculating to attain theoretical knowledge. The jnani division of
spiritualists go on speculating only to distinguish the soul from matter, but they have no information of
the activities of the soul after being liberated by knowledge. It is said that persons who only mentally
speculate to know things as they are and who do not engage in the transcendental loving service of the
Lord are simply wasting their time.
It is clearly said here that the principle of service was generated from the legs of the Lord for the sake of
perfecting the religious process, but this transcendental service is different from the idea of service in the
material world. In the material world, no one wants to be a servant; everyone wants to become the master
because false mastership is the basic disease of the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul in the material
world wants to lord it over others. Illusioned by the external energy of the Lord, he is forced to become a
servant of the material world. That is the real position of the conditioned soul. The last snare of the
illusory, external energy is the conception of becoming one with the Lord, and due to this conception the
illusioned soul remains in the bondage of material energy, falsely thinking himself a liberated soul and "as
good as Narayana."
It is actually better to be a sudra than to be a brahmana and not develop the service attitude, because
that attitude alone satisfies the Lord. Every living being--even if he be a brahmana by qualification--must
take to the transcendental service of the Lord. Both Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-Bhagavatam support
that this service attitude is the perfection of the living entity. A brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra can
perfect his occupational duties only by rendering service unto the Lord. A brahmana is supposed to know
this fact due to his perfection in Vedic wisdom. The other sections are supposed to follow the direction of
the brahmana Vaisnava (one who is a brahmana by qualification and a Vaisnava by action). That will
make the entire society perfect in regard to the order of its social construction. A disordered society
cannot satisfy either the members of the society or the Lord. Even if one is not a perfect brahmana,
ksatriya, vaisya or sudra but takes to the service of the Lord, not caring for the perfection of his social
position, he becomes a perfect human being simply by developing the attitude of service to the Supreme
Lord.
