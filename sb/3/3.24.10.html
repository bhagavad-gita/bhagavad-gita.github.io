<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavantam param brahma
sattvenamsena satru-han
tattva-sankhyana-vijnaptyai
jatam vidvan ajah svarat
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavantam--the Lord; param--supreme; brahma--Brahman; sattvena--having an uncontaminated
existence; amsena--by a plenary portion; satru-han--O killer of the enemy, Vidura; tattva-sankhyana--the
philosophy of the twenty-four material elements; vijnaptyai--for explaining; jatam--appeared; vidvan--
knowing; ajah--the unborn (Lord Brahma); sva-rat--independent.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya continued: O killer of the enemy, the unborn Lord Brahma, who is almost independent in
acquiring knowledge, could understand that a portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His
quality of pure existence, had appeared in the womb of Devahuti just to explain the complete state of
knowledge known as sankhya-yoga.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter, it is stated that the Lord Himself is the compiler of Vedanta-sutra,
and He is the perfect knower of Vedanta-sutra. Similarly, the Sankhya philosophy is compiled by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead in His appearance as Kapila. There is an imitation Kapila who has a
Sankhya philosophical system, but Kapila the incarnation of God is different from that Kapila. Kapila the
son of Kardama Muni, in His system of Sankhya philosophy, very explicitly explained not only the
material world but also the spiritual world. Brahma could understand this fact because he is svarat, almost
independent in receiving knowledge. He is called svarat because he did not go to any school or college to
learn but learned everything from within. Because Brahma is the first living creature within this universe,
he had no teacher; his teacher was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, who is seated in the
heart of every living creature. Brahma acquired knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord within the
heart; therefore he is sometimes called svarat and aja.
Another important point is stated here. Sattvenamsena: when the Supreme Personality of Godhead
appears, He brings with Him all His paraphernalia of Vaikuntha; therefore His name, His form, His
quality, His paraphernalia and His entourage all belong to the transcendental world. Real goodness is in
the transcendental world. Here in the material world, the quality of goodness is not pure. Goodness may
exist, but there must also be some tinges of passion and ignorance. In the spiritual world the unalloyed
quality of goodness prevails; there the quality of goodness is called suddha-sattva, pure goodness. Another
name for suddha-sattva is vasudeva because God is born from Vasudeva. Another meaning is that when
one is purely situated in the qualities of goodness, he can understand the form, name, quality,
paraphernalia and entourage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The word amsena also indicates that
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appeared as Kapiladeva in a portion of His portion. God
expands either as kala or as amsa. Amsa means "direct expansion," and kala means "expansion of the
expansion." There is no difference between the expansion, the expansion of the expansion, and the
Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, as there is no difference between one candle and another--but
still the candle from which the others are lit is called the original. Krsna, therefore, is called the
Parabrahman, or the ultimate Godhead and cause of all causes.
