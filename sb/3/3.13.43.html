<h2>Translation</h2>
Who else but You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could deliver the earth from within the water?
It is not very wonderful for You, however, because You acted most wonderfully in the creation of the
universe. By Your energy You have created this wonderful cosmic manifestation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a scientist discovers something impressive to the ignorant mass of people, the common man,
without inquiry, accepts such a discovery as wonderful. But the intelligent man is not struck with wonder
by such discoveries. He gives all credit to the person who created the wonderful brain of the scientist. A
common man is also struck with wonder by the wonderful action of material nature, and he gives all
credit to the cosmic manifestation. The learned Krsna conscious person, however, knows well that behind
the cosmic manifestation is the brain of Krsna, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena
prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram. Since Krsna can direct the wonderful cosmic manifestation, it is not at all
wonderful for Him to assume the gigantic form of a boar and thus deliver the earth from the mire of the
water. A devotee is therefore not astonished to see the wonderful boar because he knows that the Lord is
able to act far more wonderfully by His potencies, which are inconceivable to the brain of even the most
erudite scientist.
