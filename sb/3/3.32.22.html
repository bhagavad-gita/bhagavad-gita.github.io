<h2>Text</h2>
tam eva dhyayati devam
apatyam kapilam harim
babhuvacirato vatsa
nihsprha tadrse grhe
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--upon Him; eva--certainly; dhyayati--meditating; devam--divine; apatyam--son; kapilam--Lord
Kapila; harim--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; babhuva--became; aciratah--very soon; vatsa--O dear
Vidura; nihsprha--unattached; tadrse grhe--to such a home.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Vidura, thus always meditating upon her son, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapiladeva, she
very soon became unattached to her nicely decorated home.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here is a practical example of how one can elevate oneself in spiritual advancement by Krsna
consciousness. Kapiladeva is Krsna, and He appeared as the son of Devahuti. After Kapiladeva left home,
Devahuti was absorbed in thought of Him, and thus she was always Krsna conscious. Her constant
situation in Krsna consciousness enabled her to be detached from hearth and home.
Unless we are able to transfer our attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no
possibility of becoming freed from material attachment. The Srimad-Bhagavatam, therefore, confirms that
it is not possible for one to become liberated by cultivation of empiric philosophical speculation. Simply
knowing that one is not matter but spirit soul, or Brahman, does not purify one's intelligence. Even if the
impersonalist reaches the highest platform of spiritual realization, he falls down again to material
attachment because of not being situated in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.
The devotees adopt the devotional process, hearing about the Supreme Lord's pastimes and glorifying
His activities and thereby always remembering His beautiful eternal form. By rendering service, becoming
His friend or His servant and offering Him everything that one possesses, one is able to enter into the
kingdom of God. As it is said in Bhagavad-gita, tato mam tattvato jnatva: after discharging pure devotional
service, one can understand the Supreme personality of Godhead in fact, and thus one becomes eligible to
enter into His association in one of the spiritual planets.
