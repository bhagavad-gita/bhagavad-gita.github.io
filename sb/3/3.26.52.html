<h2>Translation</h2>
This universal egg, or the universe in the shape of an egg, is called the manifestation of material energy.
Its layers of water, air, fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva increase in thickness one after another. Each layer is
ten times bigger than the previous one, and the final outside layer is covered by pradhana. Within this egg
is the universal form of Lord Hari, of whose body the fourteen planetary systems are parts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This universe, or the universal sky which we can visualize with its innumerable planets, is shaped just
like an egg. As an egg is covered by a shell, the universe is also covered by various layers. The first layer is
water, the next is fire, then air, then sky, and the ultimate holding crust is pradhana. Within this egglike
universe is the universal form of the Lord as the virat-purusa. All the different planetary situations are
parts of His body. This is already explained in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, Second Canto. The
planetary systems are considered to form different bodily parts of that universal form of the Lord. Persons
who cannot directly engage in the worship of the transcendental form of the Lord are advised to think of
and worship this universal form. The lowest planetary system, Patala, is considered to be the sole of the
Supreme Lord, and the earth is considered to be the belly of the Lord. Brahmaloka, or the highest
planetary system, where Brahma lives, is considered to be the head of the Lord.
This virat-purusa is considered an incarnation of the Lord. The original form of the Lord is Krsna, as
confirmed in Brahma-samhita: adi-purusa. The virat-purusa is also purusa, but He is not adi-purusa. The
adi-purusa is Krsna. Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah. anadir adir govindah. In Bhagavadgita
Krsna is also accepted as the adi-purusa, the original. Krsna says, "No one is greater than I." There are
innumerable expansions of the Lord, and all of them are purusas, or enjoyers, but neither the virat-purusa
nor the purusa-avataras--Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu--nor any
of the many other expansions, is the original. In each universe there are Garbhodakasayi Visnu, the viratpurusa
and Ksirodakasayi Visnu. The active manifestation of the virat-purusa is described here. persons
who are in the lower grade of understanding regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead may think of
the universal form of the Lord, for that is advised in the Bhagavatam.
The dimensions of the universe are estimated here. The outer covering is made of layers of water, air,
fire, sky, ego and mahat-tattva, and each layer is ten times greater than the one previous. The space within
the hollow of the universe cannot be measured by any human scientist or anyone else, and beyond the
hollow there are seven coverings, each one ten times greater than the one preceding it. The layer of water
is ten times greater than the diameter of the universe, and the layer of fire is ten times greater than that of
water. Similarly, the layer of air is ten times greater than that of fire. These dimensions are all
inconceivable to the tiny brain of a human being.
It is also stated that this description is of only one egglike universe. There are innumerable universes
besides this one, and some of them are many, many times greater. It is considered, in fact, that this
universe is the smallest; therefore the predominating superintendent, or Brahma, has only four heads for
management. In other universes, which are far greater than this one, Brahma has more heads. In the
Caitanya-caritamrta it is stated that all these Brahmas were called one day by Lord Krsna on the inquiry of
the small Brahma, who, after seeing all the larger Brahmas, was thunderstruck. That is the inconceivable
potency of the Lord. No one can measure the length and breadth of God by speculation or by false
identification with God. These attempts are symptoms of lunacy.
