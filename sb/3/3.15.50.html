<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, we therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Your eternal form as the Personality of
Godhead, which You have so kindly manifested before us. Your supreme, eternal form cannot be seen by
unfortunate, less intelligent persons, but we are so much satisfied in our mind and vision to see it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The four sages were impersonalists in the beginning of their spiritual life, but afterwards, by the grace of
their father and spiritual master, Brahma, they understood the eternal, spiritual form of the Lord and felt
completely satisfied. In other words, the transcendentalists who aspire to the impersonal Brahman or
localized Paramatma are not fully satisfied and still hanker for more. Even if they are satisfied in their
minds, still, transcendentally, their eyes are not satisfied. But as soon as such persons come to realize the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are satisfied in all respects. In other words, they become devotees
and want to see the form of the Lord continually. It is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita that one who has
developed transcendental love of Krsna by smearing his eyes with the ointment of love sees constantly the
eternal form of the Lord. The particular word used in this connection, anatmanam, signifies those who
have no control over the mind and senses and who therefore speculate and want to become one with the
Lord. Such persons cannot have the pleasure of seeing the eternal form of the Lord. For the impersonalists
and the so-called yogis, the Lord is always hidden by the curtain of yogamaya. Bhagavad-gita says that
even when Lord Krsna was seen by everyone while He was present on the surface of the earth, the
impersonalists and the so-called yogis could not see Him because they were devoid of devotional eyesight.
The theory of the impersonalists and so-called yogis is that the Supreme Lord assumes a particular form
when He comes in touch with maya, although actually He has no form. This very conception of the
impersonalists and so-called yogis checks them from seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is.
The Lord, therefore, is always beyond the sight of such nondevotees. The four sages felt so much obliged
to the Lord that they offered their respectful obeisances unto Him again and again.
Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Fifteenth Chapter, of the Srimad-Bhagavatam,
entitled "Description of the Kingdom of God."
