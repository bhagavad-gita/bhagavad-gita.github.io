<h2>Text</h2>
kaccid dhareh saumya sutah sadrksa

<p></p>

kaccit--whether; hareh--of the Personality of Godhead; saumya--O grave one; sutah--son; sadrksah--
similar; aste--fares well; agranih--foremost; rathinam--of the warriors; sadhu--well behaved; sambah--
Samba; asuta--gave birth; yam--whom; jambavati--Jambavati, a queen of Lord Krsna's; vratadhya--enriched

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O gentle one, does Samba fare well? He exactly resembles the son of the Personality of Godhead. In a
previous birth he was born as Karttikeya in the womb of the wife of Lord Siva, and now he has been born
in the womb of Jambavati, the most enriched wife of Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Siva, one of the three qualitative incarnations of the Personality of Godhead, is the plenary
expansion of the Lord. Karttikeya, born of him, is on the level of Pradyumna, another son of Lord Krsna.
When Lord Sri Krsna descends into the material world, all His plenary portions also appear with Him to
exhibit different functions of the Lord. But for the pastimes at Vrndavana, all functions are performed by
the Lord's different plenary expansions. Vasudeva is a plenary expansion of Narayana. When the Lord
appeared as Vasudeva before Devaki and Vasudeva, He appeared in His capacity as Narayana. Similarly, all
the demigods of the heavenly kingdom appeared as associates of the Lord in the forms of Pradyumna,
Samba, Uddhava, etc. It is learned here that Kamadeva appeared as Pradyumna, Karttikeya as Samba, and
one of the Vasus as Uddhava. All of them served in their different capacities in order to enrich the
pastimes of Krsna.
