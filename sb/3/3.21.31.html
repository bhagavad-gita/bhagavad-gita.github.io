<h2>Translation</h2>
Showing compassion to all living entities, you will attain self-realization. Giving assurance of safety to
all, you will perceive your own self as well as all the universes in Me, and Myself in you.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The simple process of self-realization for every living entity is described here. The first principle to be
understood is that this world is a product of the supreme will. There is an identity of this world with the
Supreme Lord. This identity is accepted in a misconceived way by the impersonalists; they say that the
Supreme Absolute Truth, transforming Himself into the universe, loses His separate existence. Thus they
accept the world and everything in it to be the Lord. That is pantheism, wherein everything is considered
to be the Lord. This is the view of the impersonalist. But those who are personal devotees of the Lord take
everything to be the property of the Supreme Lord. Everything, whatever we see, is the manifestation of
the Supreme Lord; therefore, everything should be engaged in the service of the Lord. This is oneness.
The difference between the impersonalist and the personalist is that the impersonalist does not accept the
separate existence of the Lord, but the personalist accepts the Lord; he understands that although He
distributes Himself in so many ways, He has His separate personal existence. This is described in
Bhagavad-gita: "I am spread all over the universe in My impersonal form. Everything is resting on Me, but
I am not present." There is a nice example regarding the sun and the sunshine. The sun, by its sunshine,
is spread all over the universe, and all the planets rest on the sunshine. But all the planets are different
from the sun planet; one cannot say that because the planets are resting on the sunshine, these planets are
also the sun. Similarly, the impersonal or pantheistic view that everything is God is not a very intelligent
proposal. The real position, as explained by the Lord Himself, is that although nothing can exist without
Him, it is not a fact that everything is Him. He is different from everything. So here also the Lord says:
"You will see everything in the world to be nondifferent from Me." This means that everything should be
considered a product of the Lord's energy, and therefore everything should be employed in the service of
the Lord. One's energy should be utilized for one's self-interest. That is the perfection of the energy.
This energy can be utilized for real self-interest if one is compassionate. A person in Krsna
consciousness, a devotee of the Lord, is always compassionate. He is not satisfied that only he himself is a
devotee, but he tries to distribute the knowledge of devotional service to everyone. There are many
devotees of the Lord who faced many risks in distributing the devotional service of the Lord to people in
general. That should be done.
It is also said that a person who goes to the temple of the Lord and worships with great devotion, but
who does not show sympathy to people in general or show respect to other devotees, is considered to be a
third-class devotee. The second-class devotee is he who is merciful and compassionate to the fallen soul.
The second-class devotee is always cognizant of his position as an eternal servant of the Lord; he therefore
makes friendships with devotees of the Lord, acts compassionately toward the general public in teaching
them devotional service, and refuses to cooperate or associate with nondevotees. As long as one is not
compassionate to people in general in his devotional service to the Lord, he is a third-class devotee. The
first-class devotee gives assurance to every living being that there is no fear of this material existence: "Let
us live in Krsna consciousness and conquer the nescience of material existence."
It is indicated here that Kardama Muni was directed by the Lord to be very compassionate and liberal in
his householder life and to give assurance to the people in his renounced life. A sannyasi, one in the
renounced order of life, is meant to give enlightenment to the people. He should travel, going from home
to home to enlighten. The householder, by the spell of maya, becomes absorbed in family affairs and
forgets his relationship with Krsna. If he dies in forgetfulness, like the cats and dogs, then his life is
spoiled. It is the duty of a sannyasi, therefore, to go and awaken the forgetful souls with enlightenment of
their eternal relationship with the Lord and to engage them in devotional service. The devotee should
show mercy to the fallen souls and also give them the assurance of fearlessness. As soon as one becomes a
devotee of the Lord, he is convinced that he is protected by the Lord. Fear itself is afraid of the Lord;
therefore, what has he to do with fearfulness?
To award fearlessness to the common man is the greatest act of charity. A sannyasi, or one who is in the
renounced order of life, should wander from door to door, from village to village, from town to town and
from country to country, all over the world as far as he is able to travel, and enlighten the householders
about Krsna consciousness. A person who is a householder but is initiated by a sannyasi has the duty to
spread Krsna consciousness at home; as far as possible, he should call his friends and neighbors to his
house and hold classes in Krsna consciousness. Holding a class means chanting the holy name of Krsna
and speaking from Bhagavad-gita or Srimad-Bhagavatam. There are immense literatures for spreading
Krsna consciousness, and it is the duty of each and every householder to learn about Krsna from his
sannyasi spiritual master. There is a division of labor in the Lord's service. The householder's duty is to
earn money because a sannyasi is not supposed to earn money but is completely dependent on the
householder. The householder should earn money by business or by profession and spend at least fifty
percent of his income to spread Krsna consciousness; twenty-five percent he can spend for his family, and
twenty-five percent he should save to meet emergencies. This example was shown by Rupa Gosvami, so
devotees should follow it.
Actually, to be one with the Supreme Lord means to be one with the interest of the Lord. Becoming one
with the Supreme Lord does not imply becoming as great as the Supreme Lord. It is impossible. The part
is never equal to the whole. The living entity is always a minute part. Therefore his oneness with the Lord
is that he is interested in the one interest of the Lord. The Lord wants every living entity to always think
about Him, to be His devotee and always worship Him. This is clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita: man-mana
bhava mad-bhaktah. Krsna wants everyone always to think of Him. Everyone should always offer
obeisances to Krsna. This is the will of the Supreme Lord, and devotees should try to fulfill His desire.
Since the Lord is unlimited, His desire is also unlimited. There is no stoppage, and therefore the service of
the devotee is also unlimited. In the transcendental world there is unlimited competition between the
Lord and the servitor. The Lord wants to fulfill His desires unlimitedly, and the devotee also serves Him to
fulfill His unlimited desires. There is an unlimited oneness of interest between the Lord and His devotee.
