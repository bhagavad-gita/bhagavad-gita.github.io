<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: Devahuti was fully faithful and respectful toward the direction of her husband,
Kardama, who was one of the Prajapatis, or generators of human beings in the universe. O great sage, she
thus began to worship the master of the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in
everyone's heart.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This is the process of spiritual realization; one has to receive instruction from a bona fide spiritual
master. Kardama Muni was Devahuti's husband, but because he instructed her on how to achieve spiritual
perfection, he naturally became her spiritual master also. There are many instances wherein the husband
becomes the spiritual master. Lord Siva also is the spiritual master of his consort, Parvati. A husband
should be so enlightened that he should become the spiritual master of his wife in order to enlighten her
in the advancement of Krsna consciousness. Generally stri, or woman, is less intelligent than man;
therefore, if the husband is intelligent enough, the woman gets a great opportunity for spiritual
enlightenment.
Here it is clearly said (samyak sraddhaya) that with great faith one should receive knowledge from the
spiritual master and with great faith execute the performance of service. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti
Thakura, in his commentary on Bhagavad-gita, has especially stressed the instruction of the spiritual
master. One should accept the instruction of the spiritual master as one's life and soul. Whether one is
liberated or not liberated, one should execute the instruction of the spiritual master with great faith. It is
also stated that the Lord is situated in everyone's heart. One does not have to seek the Lord outside; He is
already there. One simply has to concentrate on one's worship in good faith, as instructed by the bona fide
spiritual master, and one's efforts will come out successfully. It is also clear that the Supreme Personality
of Godhead does not appear as an ordinary child; He appears as He is. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, He
appears by His own internal potency, atma-maya. And how does He appear? He appears when pleased by
the worship of a devotee. A devotee may ask the Lord to appear as her son. The Lord is already sitting
within the heart, and if He comes out from the body of a devotee it does not mean that the particular
woman becomes His mother in the material sense. He is always there, but in order to please His devotee,
He appears as her son.
