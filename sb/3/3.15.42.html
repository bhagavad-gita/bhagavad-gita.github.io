<h2>Translation</h2>
The exquisite beauty of Narayana, being many times magnified by the intelligence of His devotees, was
so attractive that it defeated the pride of the goddess of fortune in being the most beautiful. My dear
demigods, the Lord who thus manifested Himself is worshipable by me, by Lord Siva and by all of you.
The sages regarded Him with unsated eyes and joyously bowed their heads at His lotus feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The beauty of the Lord was so enchanting that it could not be sufficiently described. The goddess of
fortune is supposed to be the most beautiful sight within the spiritual and material creations of the Lord;
she has a sense of being the most beautiful, yet her beauty was defeated when the Lord appeared. In other
words, the beauty of the goddess of fortune is secondary in the presence of the Lord. In the words of
Vaisnava poets, it is said that the Lord's beauty is so enchanting that it defeats hundreds of thousands of
Cupids. He is therefore called Madana-mohana. It is also described that the Lord sometimes becomes mad
after the beauty of Radharani. Poets describe that under those circumstances, although Lord Krsna is
Madana-mohana, He becomes Madana-daha, or enchanted by the beauty of Radharani. Actually the Lord's
beauty is superexcellent, surpassing even the beauty of Laksmi in Vaikuntha. The devotees of the Lord in
the Vaikuntha planets want to see the Lord as the most beautiful, but the devotees in Gokula or Krsnaloka
want to see Radharani as more beautiful than Krsna. The adjustment is that the Lord, being bhaktavatsala,
or one who wants to please His devotees, assumes such features so that devotees like Lord
Brahma, Lord Siva and other demigods may be pleased. Here also, for the devotee-sages, the Kumaras, the
Lord appeared in His most beautiful feature, and they continued to see Him without satiation and wanted
to continue seeing Him more and more.
