<h2>Translation</h2>
O My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment.
You must seek attachment to such holy men, for this counteracts the pernicious effects of material
attachment.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kapila Muni herein advises His mother, Devahuti, that if she wants to be free from material attachment,
she should increase her attachment for the sadhus, or devotees who are completely freed from all material
attachment. In Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter, verse 5, it is stated who is qualified to enter into the
kingdom of Godhead. It is said there, nirmana-moha jita-sanga-dosah. This refers to one who is
completely freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness. A person may be materially
very rich, opulent or respectable, but if he at all wants to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, back
home, back to Godhead, then he has to be freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness,
because that is a false position.
The word moha used here means the false understanding that one is rich or poor. In this material world,
the conception that one is very rich or very poor--or any such consciousness in connection with material
existence--is false, because this body itself is false, or temporary. A pure soul who is prepared to be freed
from this material entanglement must first of all be free from the association of the three modes of nature.
Our consciousness at the present moment is polluted because of association with the three modes of
nature; therefore in Bhagavad-gita the same principle is stated. It is advised, jita-sanga-dosah: one should
be freed from the contaminated association of the three modes of material nature. Here also, in the
Srimad-Bhagavatam, this is confirmed: a pure devotee, who is preparing to transfer himself to the spiritual
kingdom, is also freed from the association of the three modes of material nature. We have to seek the
association of such devotees. For this reason we have begun the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness. There are many mercantile, scientific and other associations in human society to develop
a particular type of education or consciousness, but there is no association which helps one to get free
from all material association. If anyone has reached the stage where he must become free from this
material contamination, then he has to seek the association of devotees, wherein Krsna consciousness is
exclusively cultured. One can thereby become freed from all material association.
Because a devotee is freed from all contaminated material association, he is not affected by the miseries
of material existence. Even though he appears to be in the material world, he is not affected by the
miseries of the material world. How is it possible? There is a very good example in the activities of the cat.
The cat carries her kittens in her mouth, and when she kills a rat she also carries the booty in her mouth.
Thus both are carried in the mouth of the cat, but they are in different conditions. The kitten feels
comfort in the mouth of the mother, whereas when the rat is carried in the mouth of the cat, the rat feels
the blows of death. Similarly, those who are sadhavah, or devotees engaged in Krsna consciousness in the
transcendental service of the Lord, do not feel the contamination of material miseries, whereas those who
are not devotees in Krsna consciousness actually feel the miseries of material existence. One should
therefore give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of persons engaged in
Krsna consciousness, and by such association he will benefit in spiritual advancement. By their words and
instructions, he will be able to cut off his attachment to material existence.
