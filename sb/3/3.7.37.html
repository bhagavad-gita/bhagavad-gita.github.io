pratisankramah--dissolutions; tatra--thereupon; imam--unto the Supreme Lord; ke--who are they;

<h2>Translation</h2>
Please describe how many dissolutions there are for the elements of material nature and who survives
after the dissolutions to serve the Lord while He is asleep.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the Brahma-samhita (5.47-48) it is said that all the material manifestations with innumerable
universes appear and disappear with the breathing of Maha-Visnu lying in yoga-nidra, or mystic sleep.
yah karanarnava-jale bhajati sma yoganidram
ananta-jagad-anda-saroma-kupah
adhara-saktim avalambya param sva-murtim
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya
jivanti loma-vilaja jagad-anda-nathah
visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
"Govinda, the ultimate and Supreme Personality of Godhead [Lord Krsna], lies sleeping unlimitedly on
the Causal Ocean in order to create unlimited numbers of universes during that sleep. He lies on the
water by His own internal potency, and I worship that original Supreme Godhead.
"Due to His breathing, innumerable universes come into existence, and when He withdraws His breath
there occurs the dissolution of all the lords of the universes. That plenary portion of the Supreme Lord is
called Maha-Visnu, and He is a part of the part of Lord Krsna. I worship Govinda, the original Lord."
After the dissolution of the material manifestations, the Lord and His kingdom beyond the Causal
Ocean do not disappear, nor do the inhabitants, the Lord's associates. The associates of the Lord are far
more numerous than the living entities who have forgotten the Lord due to material association. The
impersonalist's explanation of the word aham in the four verses of the original Bhagavatam--aham evasam
evagre etc.--is refuted here. The Lord and His eternal associates remain after the dissolution. Vidura's
inquiry about such persons is a clear indication of the existence of all the paraphernalia of the Lord. This
is also confirmed in the Kasi-khanda, as quoted by both Jiva Gosvami and Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti,
who follow in the footsteps of Srila Sridhara Svami.
na cyavante hi yad-bhakta
mahatyam pralayapadi
ato 'cyuto 'khile loke
sa ekah sarva-go 'vyayah
"The devotees of the Lord never annihilate their individual existences even after the dissolution of the
entire cosmic manifestation. The Lord and the devotees who associate with Him are always eternal, in
both the material and spiritual worlds."
