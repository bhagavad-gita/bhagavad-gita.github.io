<h2>Text</h2>
deho 'pi daiva-vasagah khalu karma yavat
svarambhakam pratisamiksata eva sasuh
tam sa-prapancam adhirudha-samadhi-yogah
svapnam punar na bhajate pratibuddha-vastuh
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dehah--the body; api--moreover; daiva-vasa-gah--under the control of the Personality of Godhead;
khalu--indeed; karma--activities; yavat--as much as; sva-arambhakam--begun by himself; pratisamiksate--
continues to function; eva--certainly; sa-asuh--along with the senses; tam--the body; sa-prapancam--with
its expansions; adhirudha-samadhi-yogah--being situated in samadhi by yoga practice; svapnam--born in a
dream; punah--again; na--not; bhajate--he does accept as his own; pratibuddha--awake; vastuh--to his
constitutional position.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The body of such a liberated yogi, along with the senses, is taken charge of by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, and it functions until its destined activities are finished. The liberated devotee, being awake
to his constitutional position and thus situated in samadhi, the highest perfectional stage of yoga, does not
accept the by-products of the material body as his own. Thus he considers his bodily activities to be like
the activities of a body in a dream.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The following questions may be posed. As long as the liberated soul is in contact with the body, why
don't the bodily activities affect him? Doesn't he actually become contaminated by the action and reaction
of material activities? In answer to such questions, this verse explains that the material body of a liberated
soul is taken charge of by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is not acting due to the living force of
the living entity; it is simply acting as a reaction to past activities. Even after being switched off, an electric
fan moves for some time. That movement is not due to the electric current, but is a continuation of the
last movement; similarly, although a liberated soul appears to be acting just like an ordinary man, his
actions are to be accepted as the continuation of past activities. In a dream one may see himself expanded
through many bodies, but when awake he can understand that those bodies were all false. Similarly,
although a liberated soul has the by-products of the body--children, wife, house, etc.--he does not identify
himself with those bodily expansions. He knows that they are all products of the material dream. The
gross body is made of the gross elements of matter, and the subtle body is made of mind, intelligence, ego
and contaminated consciousness. If one can accept the subtle body of a dream as false and not identify
oneself with that body, then certainly an awake person need not identify with the gross body. As one who
is awake has no connection with the activities of the body in a dream, an awakened, liberated soul has no
connection with the activities of the present body. In other words, because he is acquainted with his
constitutional position, he never accepts the bodily concept of life.
