<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
satarupa--Empress Satarupa; maha-rajni--the Empress; paribarhan--dowry; maha-dhanan--valuable
presents; dam-patyoh--to the bride and bridegroom; paryadat--gave; pritya--out of affection; bhusa--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Empress Satarupa lovingly gave most valuable presents, suitable for the occasion, such as jewelry,
clothes and household articles, in dowry to the bride and bridegroom.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The custom of giving one's daughter in charity with a dowry is still current in India. The gifts are given
according to the position of the father of the bride. Paribarhan maha-dhanan means the dowry which
must be awarded to the bridegroom at the time of marriage. Here maha-dhanan means greatly valuable
gifts befitting the dowry of an empress. The words bhusa-vasah paricchadan also appear here. Bhusa
means "ornaments," vasah means "clothing," and paricchadan means "various household articles." All
things befitting the marriage ceremony of an emperor's daughter were awarded to Kardama Muni, who
was until now observing celibacy as a brahmacari. The bride, Devahuti, was very richly dressed with
ornaments and clothing.
In this way Kardama Muni was married with full opulence to a qualified wife and was endowed with the
necessary paraphernalia for household life. In the Vedic way of marriage such a dowry is still given to the
bridegroom by the father of the bride; even in poverty-stricken India there are marriages where hundreds
and thousands of rupees are spent for a dowry. The dowry system is not illegal, as some have tried to
prove. The dowry is a gift given to the daughter by the father to show good will, and it is compulsory. In
rare cases where the father is completely unable to give a dowry, it is enjoined that he must at least give a
fruit and a flower. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, God can also be pleased even by a fruit and a flower. When
there is financial inability and no question of accumulating a dowry by another means, one can give a fruit
and flower for the satisfaction of the bridegroom.
