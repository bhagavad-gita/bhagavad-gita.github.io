<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus the devotee who worships Me, the all-pervading Lord of the universe, in unflinching devotional
service, gives up all aspirations to be promoted to heavenly planets or to become happy in this world with
wealth, children, cattle, home or anything in relationship with the body. I take him to the other side of
birth and death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Unflinching devotional service, as described in these two verses, means engaging oneself in full Krsna
consciousness, or devotional service, accepting the Supreme Lord as all in all. Since the Supreme Lord is
all-inclusive, if anyone worships Him with unflinching faith, he has automatically achieved all other
opulences and performed all other duties. The Lord promises herein that He takes His devotee to the
other side of birth and death. Lord Caitanya, therefore, recommended that one who aspires to go beyond
birth and death should have no material possessions. This means that one should not try to be happy in
this world or to be promoted to the heavenly world, nor should he try for material wealth, children,
houses or cattle.
How liberation is imperceptibly achieved by a pure devotee and what the symptoms are have been
explained. For the conditioned soul there are two statuses of living. One status is in this present life, and
the other is our preparation for the next life. If I am in the mode of goodness then I may be preparing for
promotion to the higher planets, if I am in the mode of passion then I shall remain here in a society where
activity is very prominent, and if I am in the mode of ignorance I may be degraded to animal life or a
lower grade of human life. But for a devotee there is no concern for this life or the next life because in any
life he does not desire elevation in material prosperity or a high-grade or low-grade life. He prays to the
Lord, "My dear Lord, it does not matter where I am born, but let me be born, even as an ant, in the house
of a devotee." A pure devotee does not pray to the Lord for liberation from this material bondage.
Actually, the pure devotee never thinks that he is fit for liberation. Considering his past life and his
mischievous activities, he thinks that he is fit to be sent to the lowest region of hell. If in this life I am
trying to become a devotee, this does not mean that in my many past lives I was one-hundred-percent
pious. That is not possible. A devotee, therefore, is always conscious of his real position. Only by his full
surrender to the Lord, by the Lord's grace, are his sufferings made shorter. As stated in Bhagavad-gita,
"Surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all kinds of sinful reaction." That is His mercy.
But this does not mean that one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord has committed no
misdeeds in his past life. A devotee always prays, "For my misdeeds, may I be born again and again, but
my only prayer is that I may not forget Your service." The devotee has that much mental strength, and he
prays to the Lord: "May I be born again and again, but let me be born in the home of Your pure devotee so
that I may again get a chance to develop myself."
A pure devotee is not anxious to elevate himself in his next birth. He has already given up that sort of
hope. In any life in which one is born, as a householder, or even as an animal, one must have some
children, some resources or some possessions, but a devotee is not anxious to possess anything. He is
satisfied with whatever is obtainable by God's grace. He is not at all attached to improving his social status
or improving the status of education of his children. He is not neglectful--he is dutiful--but he does not
spend too much time on the upliftment of temporary household or social life. He fully engages in the
service of the Lord, and for other affairs he simply spares as much time as absolutely necessary
(yatharham upayunjatah). Such a pure devotee does not care for what is going to happen in the next life
or in this life; he does not care even for family, children or society. He fully engages in the service of the
Lord in Krsna consciousness. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that without the knowledge of the devotee, the
Lord arranges for His devotee to be immediately transferred to His transcendental abode just after leaving
his body. After quitting his body he does not go into the womb of another mother. The ordinary common
living entity, after death, is transferred to the womb of another mother, according to his karma, or
activities, to take another type of body. But as far as the devotee is concerned, he is at once transferred to
the spiritual world in the association of the Lord. That is the Lord's special mercy. How it is possible is
explained in the following verses. Because He is all-powerful, the Lord can do anything and everything.
He can excuse all sinful reactions. He can immediately transfer a person to Vaikunthaloka. That is the
inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is favorably disposed to the pure
devotees.
