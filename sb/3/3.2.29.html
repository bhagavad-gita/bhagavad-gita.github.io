<h2>Translation</h2>
While herding the very beautiful bulls, the Lord, who was the reservoir of all opulence and fortune,
used to blow His flute, and thus He enlivened His faithful followers, the cowherd boys.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As He grew to six and seven years old, the Lord was given charge of looking after the cows and bulls in
the grazing grounds. He was the son of a well-to-do landholder who owned hundreds and thousands of
cows, and according to Vedic economics, one is considered to be a rich man by the strength of his store of
grains and cows. With only these two things, cows and grain, humanity can solve its eating problem.
Human society needs only sufficient grain and sufficient cows to solve its economic problems. All other
things but these two are artificial necessities created by man to kill his valuable life at the human level and
waste his time in things which are not needed. Lord Krsna, as the teacher of human society, personally
showed by His acts that the mercantile community, or the vaisyas, should herd cows and bulls and thus
give protection to the valuable animals. According to smrti regulation, the cow is the mother and the bull
the father of the human being. The cow is the mother because just as one sucks the breast of one's
mother, human society takes cow's milk. Similarly, the bull is the father of human society because the
father earns for the children just as the bull tills the ground to produce food grains. Human society will
kill its spirit of life by killing the father and the mother. It is mentioned herein that the beautiful cows and
bulls were of various checkered colors--red, black, green, yellow, ash, etc. And because of their colors and
healthy smiling features, the atmosphere was enlivening.
Over and above all, the Lord used to play His celebrated flute. The sound vibrated by His flute would
give His friends such transcendental pleasure that they would forget all the talks of the brahmananda
which is so praised by the impersonalists. These cowherd boys, as will be explained by Sukadeva
Gosvami, were living entities who had accumulated heaps of pious acts and thus were enjoying with the
Lord in person and were hearing His transcendental flute. The Brahma-samhita (5.30) confirms the Lord's
blowing His transcendental flute.
venum kvanantam aravinda-dalayataksam
barhavatamsam asitambuda-sundarangam
kandarpa-koti-kaminiya-visesa-sobham
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami
Brahmaji said, "I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who plays on His transcendental flute. His eyes
are like lotus flowers, He is decorated with peacock plumes, and His bodily color resembles a fresh black
cloud although His bodily features are more beautiful than millions of cupids." These are the special
features of the Lord.
