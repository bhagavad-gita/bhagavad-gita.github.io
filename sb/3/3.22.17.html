<h2>Text</h2>
yam harmya-prsthe kvanad-anghri-sobham
vikridatim kanduka-vihvalaksim
visvavasur nyapatat svad vimanad
vilokya sammoha-vimudha-cetah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yam--whom; harmya-prsthe--on the roof of the palace; kvanat-anghri-sobham--whose beauty was
heightened by the tinkling ornaments on her feet; vikridatim--playing; kanduka-vihvala-aksim--with eyes
bewildered, following her ball; visvavasuh--Visvavasu; nyapatat--fell down; svat--from his own; vimanat--
from the airplane; vilokya--seeing; sammoha-vimudha-cetah--whose mind was stupefied.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I have heard that Visvavasu, the great Gandharva, his mind stupefied with infatuation, fell from his
airplane after seeing your daughter playing with a ball on the roof of the palace, for she was indeed
beautiful with her tinkling ankle bells and her eyes moving to and fro.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood that not only at the present moment but in those days also there were skyscrapers.
Herein we find the word harmya-prsthe. Harmya means "a very big palatial building." Svad vimanat
means "from his own airplane." It is suggested that private airplanes or helicopters were also current in
those days. The Gandharva Visvavasu, while flying in the sky, could see Devahuti playing ball on the roof
of the palace. Ball playing was also current, but aristocratic girls would not play in a public place. Ball
playing and other such pleasures were not meant for ordinary women and girls; only princesses like
Devahuti could indulge in such sports. It is described here that she was seen from the flying airplane. This
indicates that the palace was very high, otherwise how could one see her from an airplane? The vision was
so distinct that the Gandharva Visvavasu was bewildered by her beauty and by hearing the sound of her
ankle bangles, and being captivated by the sound and beauty, he fell down. Kardama Muni mentioned the
incident as he had heard it.
