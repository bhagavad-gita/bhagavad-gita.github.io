<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
etavaty eva susrusa
karya pitari putrakaih
badham ity anumanyeta
gauravena guror vacah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
etavati--to this extent; eva--exactly; susrusa--service; karya--ought to be rendered; pitari--to the father;
putrakaih--by the sons; badham iti--accepting, "Yes, sir"; anumanyeta--he should obey; gauravena--with
due deference; guroh--of the guru; vacah--commands.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sons ought to render service to their father exactly to this extent. One should obey the command of his
father or spiritual master with due deference, saying, "Yes, sir."
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Two words in this verse are very important; one word is pitari, and another word is guroh. The son or
disciple should accept the words of his spiritual master and father without hesitation. Whatever the father
and the spiritual master order should be taken without argument: "Yes." There should be no instance in
which the disciple or the son says, "This is not correct. I cannot carry it out." When he says that, he is
fallen. The father and the spiritual master are on the same platform because a spiritual master is the
second father. The higher classes are called dvija, twice-born. Whenever there is a question of birth, there
must be a father. The first birth is made possible by the actual father, and the second birth is made
possible by the spiritual master. Sometimes the father and the spiritual master may be the same man, and
sometimes they are different men. In any case, the order of the father or the order of the spiritual master
must be carried out without hesitation, with an immediate yes. There should be no argument. That is real
service to the father and to the spiritual master. Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has stated that the order
of the spiritual master is the life and soul of the disciples. As a man cannot separate his life from his body,
a disciple cannot separate the order of the spiritual master from his life. If a disciple follows the
instruction of the spiritual master in that way, he is sure to become perfect. This is confirmed in the
Upanisads: the import of Vedic instruction is revealed automatically only to one who has implicit faith in
the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in his spiritual master. One may be materially considered an
illiterate man, but if he has faith in the spiritual master as well as in the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
then the meaning of scriptural revelation is immediately manifested before him.
