<h2>Translation</h2>
After showing his wife the globe of the universe and its different arrangements, full of many wonders,
the great yogi Kardama Muni returned to his own hermitage.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
All the planets are here described as gola, round. Every planet is round, and each planet is a different
shelter, just like islands in the great ocean. Planets are sometimes called dvipa or varsa. This earth planet
is called Bharata-varsa because it was ruled by King Bharata. Another significant word used in this verse is
bahv-ascaryam, "many wonderful things." This indicates that the different planets are distributed all over
the universe in the eight directions, and each and every one of them is wonderful in itself. Each planet has
its particular climatic influences and particular types of inhabitants and is completely equipped with
everything, including the beauty of the seasons. In the Brahma-samhita (5.40) it is similarly stated,
vibhuti-bhinnam: on each and every planet there are different opulences. It cannot be expected that one
planet is exactly like another. By God's grace, by nature's law, each and every planet is made differently
and has different wonderful features. All such wonders were personally experienced by Kardama Muni
while he traveled with his wife, yet he could return again to his humble hermitage. He showed his
princess-wife that although he was living in the hermitage, he had the power to go everywhere and do
anything by mystic yoga. That is the perfection of yoga. One cannot become a perfect yogi simply by
showing some sitting postures, nor by such sitting postures or so-called meditation can one become God,
as is being advertised. Foolish persons are misled into believing that simply by some caricature of
meditation and sitting postures one can become God within six months.
Here is the example of a perfect yogi; he could travel all over the universe. Similarly, there is a
description of Durvasa Muni, who also traveled in space. Actually, the perfect yogi can do that. But even if
one can travel all over the universe and show wonderful feats like Kardama Muni, he cannot be compared
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose power and inconceivable energy can never be attained by
any conditioned or liberated soul. By the actions of Kardama Muni we can understand that in spite of his
immense mystic power, he remained a devotee of the Lord. That is the real position of every living entity.
