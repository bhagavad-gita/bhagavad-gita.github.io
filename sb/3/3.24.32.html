<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, Your lotus feet are the reservoir that always deserves to receive worshipful homage from
all great sages eager to understand the Absolute Truth. You are full in opulence, renunciation,
transcendental fame, knowledge, strength and beauty, and therefore I surrender myself unto Your lotus
feet.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Actually, those who are searching after the Absolute Truth must take shelter of the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and worship Him. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advised Arjuna many
times to surrender unto Him, especially at the end of the Ninth Chapter--man-mana bhava mad-bhaktah:
"If you want to be perfect, just always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your
obeisances to Me. In this way you will understand Me, the Personality of Godhead, and ultimately you
will come back to Me, back to Godhead, back home." Why is it so? The Lord is always full in six
opulences, as mentioned herein: wealth, renunciation, fame, knowledge, strength and beauty. The word
purtam means "in full." No one can claim that all wealth belongs to him, but Krsna can claim it, since He
has full wealth. Similarly, He is full in knowledge, renunciation, strength and beauty. He is full in
everything, and no one can surpass Him. Another one of Krsna's names is asamaurdhva, which means that
no one is equal to or greater than Him.
