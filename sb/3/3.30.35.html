<h2>Text</h2>
na tathasya bhaven moho
bandhas canya-prasangatah
yosit-sangad yatha pumso
yatha tat-sangi-sangatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; tatha--in that manner; asya--of this man; bhavet--may arise; mohah--infatuation; bandhah--
bondage; ca--and; anya-prasangatah--from attachment to any other object; yosit-sangat--from attachment
to women; yatha--as; pumsah--of a man; yatha--as; tat-sangi--of men who are fond of women; sangatah--
from the fellowship.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The infatuation and bondage which accrue to a man from attachment to any other object is not as
complete as that resulting from attachment to a woman or to the fellowship of men who are fond of
women.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Attachment to women is so contaminating that one becomes attached to the condition of material life
not only by the association of women but by the contaminated association of persons who are too
attached to them. There are many reasons for our conditional life in the material world, but the topmost
of all such causes is the association of women, as will be confirmed in the following stanzas.
In Kali-yuga, association with women is very strong. In every step of life, there is association with
women. If a person goes to purchase something, the advertisements are full of pictures of women. The
physiological attraction for women is very great, and therefore people are very slack in spiritual
understanding. The Vedic civilization, being based on spiritual understanding, arranges association with
women very cautiously. Out of the four social divisions, the members of the first order (namely
brahmacarya), the third order (vanaprastha) and the fourth order (sannyasa) are strictly prohibited from
female association. Only in one order, the householder, is there license to mix with women under
restricted conditions. In other words, attraction for woman's association is the cause of the material
conditional life, and anyone interested in being freed from this conditional life must detach himself from
the association of women.
