<h2>Translation</h2>
Anyone in the entire world, even down to the candala, who lives by cooking and eating the flesh of the
dog, is immediately purified if he takes bath in hearing through the ear the glorification of My name,
fame, etc. Now you have realized Me without doubt; therefore I will not hesitate to lop off My own arm if
its conduct is found hostile to you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Real purification can take place in human society if its members take to Krsna consciousness. This is
clearly stated in all Vedic literature. Anyone who takes to Krsna consciousness in all sincerity, even if he is
not very advanced in good behavior, is purified. A devotee can be recruited from any section of human
society, although it is not expected that everyone in all segments of society is well behaved. As stated in
this verse and in many places in Bhagavad-gita, even if one is not born in a brahmana family, or even if he
is born in a family of candalas, if he simply takes to Krsna consciousness he is immediately purified. In
Bhagavad-gita, Ninth Chapter, verses 30-32, it is clearly stated that even though a man is not well
behaved, if he simply takes to Krsna consciousness he is understood to be a saintly person. As long as a
person is in this material world he has two different relationships in his dealings with others--one
relationship pertains to the body, and the other pertains to the spirit. As far as bodily affairs or social
activities are concerned, although a person is purified on the spiritual platform, it is sometimes seen that
he acts in terms of his bodily relationships. If a devotee born in the family of a candala (the lowest caste)
is sometimes found engaged in his habitual activities, he is not to be considered a candala. In other words,
a Vaisnava should not be evaluated in terms of his body. The sastra states that no one should think the
Deity in the temple to be made of wood or stone, and no one should think that a person coming from a
lower-caste family who has taken to Krsna consciousness is still of the same low caste. These attitudes are
forbidden because anyone who takes to Krsna consciousness is understood to be fully purified. He is at
least engaged in the process of purification, and if he sticks to the principle of Krsna consciousness he will
very soon be fully purified. The conclusion is that if one takes to Krsna consciousness with all
seriousness, he is to be understood as already purified, and Krsna is ready to give him protection by all
means. The Lord assures herein that He is ready to give protection to His devotee even if there is need to
cut off part of His own body.
