household; pravistah--entered; yam--whom; apatya-matya--thinking to be your son; pusnasi--maintaining;

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
You are maintaining offense personified, Duryodhana, as your infallible son, but he is envious of Lord
Krsna. And because you are thus maintaining a nondevotee of Krsna, you are devoid of all auspicious
qualities. Relieve yourself of this ill fortune as soon as possible and do good to the whole family!
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A good son is called apatya, one who does not allow his father to fall down. The son can protect the
father's soul when the father is dead by offering sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord, Visnu. This system
is still prevalent in India. After the death of his father, a son goes to offer sacrifices at the lotus feet of
Visnu at Gaya and thus delivers the father's soul if the father is fallen. But if the son is already an enemy of
Visnu, how, in such an inimical mood, can he offer sacrifice unto Lord Visnu's lotus feet? Lord Krsna is
directly the Personality of Godhead, Visnu, and Duryodhana was inimical to Him. He would therefore be
unable to protect his father, Dhrtarastra, after his death. He himself was to fall down because of his
faithlessness towards Visnu. How, then, could he protect his father? Vidura advised Dhrtarastra to get rid
of such an unworthy son as Duryodhana as soon as possible if he was at all anxious to see to the good of
his family.
According to the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, "What is the use of a son who is neither a
learned man nor a devotee of the Lord?" If a son is not a devotee of the Supreme Lord, he is just like blind
eyes--a source of trouble. A physician may sometimes advise the extrication of such useless eyes from
their sockets so that one can be relieved of the constant trouble. Duryodhana was exactly like blind,
troubling eyes; he would be a source of great trouble to the family of Dhrtarastra, as foreseen by Vidura.
Vidura therefore rightly advised his eldest brother to get rid of this source of trouble. Dhrtarastra was
wrongly maintaining such personified offense under the mistaken impression that Duryodhana was a
good son, able to liberate his father.
