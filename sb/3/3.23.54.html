<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti is lamenting her position. As a woman, she had to love someone. Somehow or other, she came
to love Kardama Muni, but without knowing of his spiritual advancement. Kardama Muni could
understand Devahuti's heart; generally all women desire material enjoyment. They are called less
intelligent because they are mostly prone to material enjoyment. Devahuti laments because her husband
had given her the best kind of material enjoyment, but she did not know that he was so advanced in
spiritual realization. Her plea was that even though she did not know the glories of her great husband,
because she had taken shelter of him she must be delivered from material entanglement. Association with
a great personality is most important. In Caitanya-caritamrta Lord Caitanya says that sadhu-sanga, the
association of a great saintly person, is very important, because even if one is not advanced in knowledge,
simply by association with a great saintly person one can immediately make considerable advancement in
spiritual life. As a woman, as an ordinary wife, Devahuti became attached to Kardama Muni in order to
satisfy her sense enjoyment and other material necessities, but actually she associated with a great
personality. Now she understood this, and she wanted to utilize the advantage of the association of her
great husband.
