TRANSLATION
The Personality of Godhead said: These attendants of Mine, Jaya and Vijaya by name, have committed a
great offense against you because of ignoring Me.
PURPORT
To commit an offense at the feet of a devotee of the Lord is a great wrong. Even when a living entity is
promoted to Vaikuntha, there is still the chance that he may commit offenses, but the difference is that
when one is in a Vaikuntha planet, even if by chance one commits an offense, he is protected by the Lord.
This is the remarkable fact in the dealings of the Lord and the servitor, as seen in the present incident
concerning Jaya and Vijaya. The word atikramam used herein indicates that in offending a devotee one
neglects the Supreme Lord Himself.
By mistake the doormen held the sages from entering Vaikunthaloka, but because they were engaged in
the transcendental service of the Lord, their annihilation was not expected by advanced devotees. The
Lord's presence on the spot was very pleasing to the hearts of the devotees. The Lord understood that the
trouble was due to His lotus feet not being seen by the sages, and therefore He wanted to please them by
personally going there. The Lord is so merciful that even if there is some impediment for the devotee, He
Himself manages matters in such a way that the devotee is not bereft of having audience at His lotus feet.
There is a very good example in the life of Haridasa Thakura. When Caitanya Mahaprabhu was residing at
Jagannatha puri, Haridasa Thakura, who happened to be Muhammadan by birth, was with Him. In Hindu
temples, especially in those days, no one but a Hindu was allowed to enter. Although Haridasa Thakura
was the greatest of all Hindus in his behavior, he considered himself a Muhammadan and did not enter
the temple. Lord Caitanya could understand his humility, and since he did not go to see the temple, Lord
Caitanya Himself, who is nondifferent from Jagannatha, used to come and sit with Haridasa Thakura
daily. Here in Srimad-Bhagavatam we also find this same behavior of the Lord. His devotees were
prevented from seeing His lotus feet, but the Lord Himself came to see them on the same lotus feet for
which they aspired. It is also significant that He was accompanied by the goddess of fortune. The goddess
of fortune is not to be seen by ordinary persons, but the Lord was so kind that although the devotees did
not aspire for such an honor, He appeared before them with the goddess of fortune.
