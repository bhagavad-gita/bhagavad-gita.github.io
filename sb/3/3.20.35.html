<h2>Text</h2>
ya va kacit tvam abale
distya sandarsanam tava
utsunosiksamananam
kanduka-kridaya manah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ya--whosoever; va--or; kacit--anyone; tvam--you; abale--O beautiful girl; distya--by fortune;
sandarsanam--seeing; tava--of you; utsunosi--you agitate; iksamananam--of the onlookers; kanduka--with
a ball; kridaya--by play; manah--the mind.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Whosoever you may be, O beautiful girl, we are fortunate in being able to see you. While playing with a
ball, you have agitated the minds of all onlookers.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Demons arrange many kinds of performances to see the glaring beauty of a beautiful woman. Here it is
stated that they saw the girl playing with a ball. Sometimes the demoniac arrange for so-called sports, like
tennis, with the opposite sex. The purpose of such sporting is to see the bodily construction of the
beautiful girl and enjoy a subtle sex mentality. This demoniac sex mentality of material enjoyment is
sometimes encouraged by so-called yogis who encourage the public to enjoy sex life in different varieties
and at the same time advertise that if one meditates on a certain manufactured mantra one can become
God within six months. The public wants to be cheated, and Krsna therefore creates such cheaters to
misrepresent and delude. These so-called yogis are actually enjoyers of the world garbed as yogis.
Bhagavad-gita, however, recommends that if one wants to enjoy life, then it cannot be with these gross
senses. A patient is advised by the experienced physician to refrain from ordinary enjoyment while in the
diseased condition. A diseased person cannot enjoy anything; he has to restrain his enjoyment in order to
get rid of the disease. Similarly, our material condition is a diseased condition. If one wants to enjoy real
sense enjoyment, then one must get free of the entanglement of material existence. In spiritual life we can
enjoy sense enjoyment which has no end. The difference between material and spiritual enjoyment is that
material enjoyment is limited. Even if a man engages in material sex enjoyment, he cannot enjoy it for
long. But when the sex enjoyment is given up, then one can enter spiritual life, which is unending. In the
Bhagavatam (5.5.1) it is stated that brahma-saukhya, spiritual happiness, is ananta, unending. Foolish
creatures are enamored by the beauty of matter and think that the enjoyment it offers is real, but actually
that is not real enjoyment.
