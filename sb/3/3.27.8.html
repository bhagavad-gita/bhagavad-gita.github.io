<h2>Translation</h2>
For his income a devotee should be satisfied with what he earns without great difficulty. He should not
eat more than what is necessary. He should live in a secluded place and always be thoughtful, peaceful,
friendly, compassionate and self-realized.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Everyone who has accepted a material body must maintain the necessities of the body by acting or
earning some livelihood. A devotee should only work for such income as is absolutely necessary. He
should be satisfied always with such income and should not endeavor to earn more and more simply to
accumulate the unnecessary. A person in the conditioned state who has no money is always found
working very hard to earn some with the object of lording it over material nature. Kapiladeva instructs
that we should not endeavor hard for things which may come automatically, without extraneous labor.
The exact word used in this connection, yadrcchaya, means that every living entity has a predestined
happiness and distress in his present body; this is called the law of karma. It is not possible that simply by
endeavors to accumulate more money a person will be able to do so, otherwise almost everyone would be
on the same level of wealth. In reality everyone is earning and acquiring according to his predestined
karma. According to the Bhagavatam conclusion, we are sometimes faced with dangerous or miserable
conditions without endeavoring for them, and similarly we may have prosperous conditions without
endeavoring for them. We are advised to let these things come as predestined. We should engage our
valuable time in prosecuting Krsna consciousness. In other words, one should be satisfied by his natural
condition. If by predestination one is put into a certain condition of life which is not very prosperous in
comparison to another's position, one should not be disturbed. He should simply try to utilize his
valuable time to advance in Krsna consciousness. Advancement in Krsna consciousness does not depend
on any materially prosperous or distressed condition; it is free from the conditions imposed by material
life. A very poor man can execute Krsna consciousness as effectively as a very rich man. One should
therefore be very satisfied with his position as offered by the Lord.
Another word here is mita-bhuk. This means that one should eat only as much as necessary to maintain
the body and soul together. One should not be gluttonous to satisfy the tongue. Grains, fruits, milk and
similar foods are allotted for human consumption. One should not be excessively eager to satisfy the
tongue and eat that which is not meant for humanity. Particularly, a devotee should eat only prasada, or
food which is offered to the Personality of Godhead. His position is to accept the remnants of those
foodstuffs. Innocent foods like grains, vegetables, fruits, flowers and milk preparations are offered to the
Lord, and therefore there is no scope for offering foods which are in the modes of passion and ignorance.
A devotee should not be greedy. It is also recommended that the devotee should be muni, or thoughtful;
he should always think of Krsna and how to render better service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
That should be his only anxiety. As a materialist is always thoughtful about improving his material
condition, a devotee's thoughts should always be engaged in improving his condition in Krsna
consciousness; therefore he should be a muni.
The next item recommended is that a devotee should live in a secluded place. Generally a common man
is interested in pounds, shillings and pence, or materialistic advancement in life, which is unnecessary for
a devotee. A devotee should select a place of residence where everyone is interested in devotional service.
Generally, therefore, a devotee goes to a sacred place of pilgrimage where devotees live. It is
recommended that he live in a place where there is no large number of ordinary men. It is very important
to live in a secluded place (vivikta-sarana). The next item is santa, or peacefulness. The devotee should
not be agitated. He should be satisfied with his natural income, eat only as much as he needs to keep his
health, live in a secluded place and always remain peaceful. Peace of mind is necessary for prosecuting
Krsna consciousness.
The next item is maitra, friendliness. A devotee should be friendly to everyone, but his intimate
friendship should be with devotees only. With others he should be official. He may say, "Yes, sir, what
you say is all right," but he is not intimate with them. A devotee should, however, have compassion for
persons who are innocent, who are neither atheistic nor very much advanced in spiritual realization. A
devotee should be compassionate towards them and instruct them as far as possible in making
advancement in Krsna consciousness. A devotee should always remain atmavan, or situated in his
spiritual position. He should not forget that his main concern is to make advancement in spiritual
consciousness, or Krsna consciousness, and he should not ignorantly identify himself with the body or the
mind. Atma means the body or the mind, but here the word atmavan especially means that one should be
self-possessed. He should always remain in the pure consciousness that he is spirit soul and not the
material body or the mind. That will make him progress confidently in Krsna consciousness.
