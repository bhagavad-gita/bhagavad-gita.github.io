kaumodakim bhagavato dayitam smareta
digdham arati-bhata-sonita-kardamena
malam madhuvrata-varutha-giropaghustam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
kaumodakim--the club named Kaumodaki; bhagavatah--of the Personality of Godhead; dayitam--very
dear; smareta--one should remember; digdham--smeared; arati--of the enemies; bhata--soldiers; sonitakardamena--
with the bloodstains; malam--the garland; madhuvrata--of bumblebees; varutha--of a swarm;
gira--with the sound; upaghustam--surrounded; caityasya--of the living entity; tattvam--principle, truth;
amalam--pure; manim--the pearl necklace; asya--of the Lord; kanthe--on the neck.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The yogi should meditate upon His club, which is named Kaumodaki and is very dear to Him. This club
smashes the demons, who are always inimical soldiers, and is smeared with their blood. One should also
concentrate on the nice garland on the neck of the Lord, which is always surrounded by bumblebees, with
their nice buzzing sound, and one should meditate upon the pearl necklace on the Lord's neck, which is
considered to represent the pure living entities who are always engaged in His service.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The yogi must contemplate the different parts of the transcendental body of the Lord. Here it is stated
that the constitutional position of the living entities should be understood. There are two kinds of living
entities mentioned here. One is called the arati. They are averse to understanding the pastimes of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. For them, the Lord appears with His hand clutching the terrible mace,
which is always smeared with bloodstains from His killing of demons. Demons are also sons of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, all the different species of living entities are
sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are, however, two classes of living entities, who act in
two different ways. The Supreme Lord keeps on His neck those living entities who are pure, as one
protects the jewels and pearls on the bosom and neck of one's body. Those living entities in pure Krsna
consciousness are symbolized by the pearls on His neck. Those who are demons and are inimical towards
the pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are punished by His mace, which is always smeared
with the blood of such fallen living entities. The club of the Lord is very dear to Him because He uses this
instrument to smash the bodies of the demons and mix their blood. As mud is kneaded with water and
earth, so the earthly bodies of the enemies of the Lord, or the atheists, are smashed by the club of the
Lord, which becomes muddied with the blood of such demons.
