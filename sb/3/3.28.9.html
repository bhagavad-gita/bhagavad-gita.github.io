<h2>Translation</h2>
The worship of Deities in the temple by a separatist, with a motive for material enjoyment, fame and
opulence, is devotion in the mode of passion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word "separatist" must be understood carefully. The Sanskrit words in this connection are bhinnadrk
and prthag-bhavah. A separatist is one who sees his interest as separate from that of the Supreme
Lord. Mixed devotees, or devotees in the modes of passion and ignorance, think that the interest of the
Supreme Lord is supplying the orders of the devotee; the interest of such devotees is to draw from the
Lord as much as possible for their sense gratification. This is the separatist mentality. Actually, pure
devotion is explained in the previous chapter: the mind of the Supreme Lord and the mind of the devotee
should be dovetailed. A devotee should not wish anything but to execute the desire of the Supreme. That
is oneness. When the devotee has an interest or will different from the interest of the Supreme Lord, his
mentality is that of a separatist. When the so-called devotee desires material enjoyment, without reference
to the interest of the Supreme Lord, or he wants to become famous or opulent by utilizing the mercy or
grace of the Supreme Lord, he is in the mode of passion.
Mayavadis, however, interpret this word "separatist" in a different way. They say that while worshiping
the Lord, one should think himself one with the Supreme Lord. This is another adulterated form of
devotion within the modes of material nature. The conception that the living entity is one with the
Supreme is in the mode of ignorance. Oneness is actually based on oneness of interest. A pure devotee has
no interest but to act on behalf of the Supreme Lord. When one has even a tinge of personal interest, his
devotion is mixed with the three modes of material nature.
