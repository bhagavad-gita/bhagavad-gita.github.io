<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, You are the protector of the highest of the twice-born. If You do not protect them by offering
worship and mild words, then certainly the auspicious path of worship will be rejected by people in
general, who act on the strength and authority of Your Lordship.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is stated by the Lord Himself that the acts and character of great authorities are
followed by people in general. Leaders of ideal character are therefore needed in society. Krsna, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared in this material world just to show the example of perfect
authority, and people have to follow His path. The Vedic injunction is that one cannot understand the
Absolute Truth simply by mental speculation or logical argument. One has to follow the authorities.
Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah. Great authorities should be followed; otherwise, if we simply depend on
the scriptures, we are sometimes misled by rascals, or else we cannot understand or follow the different
spiritual injunctions. The best path is to follow the authorities. The four brahmana-sages stated that Krsna
is naturally the protector of the cows and brahmanas: go-brahmana-hitaya ca. When Krsna was on this
planet, He set a practical example. He was a cowherd boy, and He was very respectful to the brahmanas
and devotees.
It is also affirmed herein that the brahmanas are the best of the twice-born. Brahmanas, ksatriyas and
vaisyas are all twice-born, but the brahmanas are the best. When there is a fight between two persons,
each of them protects the upper part of his body--the head, the arms and the belly. Similarly, for the
actual advancement of human civilization, the best part of the social body, namely the brahmanas, the
ksatriyas and vaisyas (the intelligent class of men, the military class and the mercantile men) should be
given special protection. Protection of the laborers should not be neglected, but special protection should
be given to the upper orders. Of all classes of men, the brahmanas and the Vaisnavas should be given
special protection. They should be worshiped. When their protection is performed, it is just like
worshiping God. That is not exactly protection; it is a duty. One should worship the brahmanas and
Vaisnavas by offering them all kinds of endowments and sweet words, and if one has no means to offer
anything, he must at least use sweet words to pacify them. The Lord personally exhibited this behavior
towards the Kumaras.
If this system is not introduced by the leaders, then human civilization will be lost. When there is no
protection and special treatment for persons who are devotees of the Lord, who are highly intelligent in
spiritual life, then the whole society is lost. The word nanksyati indicates that such a civilization becomes
spoiled and is annihilated. The kind of civilization recommended is called deva-patha, which means the
"royal road of the demigods." Demigods are supposed to be fully fixed in devotional service, or Krsna
consciousness; that is the auspicious path that should be protected. If the authorities or the leaders of
society do not give special respect to the brahmanas and Vaisnavas and do not offer them not only sweet
words but all facilities, then the path of progress will be lost to human civilization. The Lord personally
wanted to teach this, and therefore He offered so much praise to the Kumaras.
