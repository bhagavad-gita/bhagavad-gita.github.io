<h2>Text</h2>
nivrtti-dharma-nirata
nirmama nirahankrtah
sva-dharmaptena sattvena
parisuddhena cetasa
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
nivrtti-dharma--in religious activities for detachment; niratah--constantly engaged; nirmamah--without
a sense of proprietorship; nirahankrtah--without false egoism; sva-dharma--by one's own occupational
duties; aptena--executed; sattvena--by goodness; parisuddhena--completely purified; cetasa--by
consciousness.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
By executing one's occupational duties, acting with detachment and without a sense of proprietorship or
false egoism, one is posted in one's constitutional position by dint of complete purification of
consciousness, and by thus executing so-called material duties he can easily enter into the kingdom of
God.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the word nivrtti-dharma-niratah means "constantly engaging in executing religious activities for
detachment." There are two kinds of religious performances. One is called pravrtti-dharma, which means
the religious activities performed by the grhamedhis for elevation to higher planets or for economic
prosperity, the final aim of which is sense gratification. Every one of us who has come to this material
world has the sense of overlordship. This is called pravrtti. But the opposite type of religious performance,
which is called nivrtti, is to act for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Engaged in devotional service in
Krsna consciousness, one has no proprietorship claim, nor is one situated in the false egoism of thinking
that he is God or the master. He always thinks himself the servant. That is the process of purifying
consciousness. With pure consciousness only can one enter into the kingdom of God. Materialistic
persons, in their elevated condition, can enter any one of the planets within this material world, but all
are subjected to dissolution over and over again.
