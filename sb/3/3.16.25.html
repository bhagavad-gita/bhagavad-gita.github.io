<h2>Translation</h2>
O Lord, whatever punishment You wish to award to these two innocent persons or also to us we shall
accept without duplicity. We understand that we have cursed two faultless persons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The sages, the four Kumaras, now reject their cursing of the two doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya, because
they are now conscious that persons who engage in the service of the Lord cannot be at fault at any stage.
It is said that anyone who has implicit faith in the service of the Lord, or who actually engages in
transcendental loving service, has all the good qualities of the demigods. Therefore, a devotee cannot be at
fault. If sometimes it is found that he is in error by accident or by some temporary arrangement, that
should not be taken very seriously. The cursing of Jaya and Vijaya is here repented. Now the Kumaras are
thinking in terms of their position in the modes of passion and ignorance, and they are prepared to accept
any kind of punishment from the Lord. In general, when dealing with devotees, we should not try to find
faults. In Bhagavad-gita also it is confirmed that the devotee who faithfully serves the Supreme Lord, even
if found to commit a gross mistake, should be considered a sadhu, or saintly person. Due to former habits
he may commit some wrong, but because he is engaged in the service of the Lord, that wrong should not
be taken very seriously.
