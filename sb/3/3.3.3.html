<h2>Translation</h2>
Attracted by the beauty and fortune of Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhismaka, many great princes and
kings assembled to marry her. But Lord Krsna, stepping over the other hopeful candidates, carried her
away as His own share, as Garuda carried away nectar.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Princess Rukmini, the daughter of King Bhismaka, was actually as attractive as fortune itself because she
was as valuable as gold both in color and in value. Since the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is the property of
the Supreme Lord, Rukmini was actually meant for Lord Krsna. But Sisupala was selected as her
bridegroom by Rukmini's elder brother, although King Bhismaka wanted his daughter to be married to
Krsna. Rukmini invited Krsna to take her away from the clutches of Sisupala, so when the bridegroom,
Sisupala, came there with his party with the desire to marry Rukmini, Krsna all of a sudden swept her
from the scene, stepping over the heads of all the princes there, just as Garuda carried away nectar from
the hands of the demons. This incident will be clearly explained in the Tenth Canto.
