<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma said: O my Lord, today, after many, many years of penance, I have come to know about
You. Oh, how unfortunate the embodied living entities are that they are unable to know Your personality!
My Lord, You are the only knowable object because there is nothing supreme beyond You. If there is
anything supposedly superior to You, it is not the Absolute. You exist as the Supreme by exhibiting the
creative energy of matter.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The highest peak of the ignorance of the living entities who are conditioned by material bodies is that
they are unaware of the supreme cause of the cosmic manifestation. Different people have different
theories regarding the supreme cause, but none of them are genuine. The only supreme cause is Visnu,
and the intervening impediment is the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord has employed His wonderful
material energy in manifesting many, many wonderful distractions in the material world, and the
conditioned souls, illusioned by the same energy, are thus unable to know the supreme cause. The most
stalwart scientists and philosophers, therefore, cannot be accepted as wonderful. They only appear
wonderful because they are instruments in the hands of the illusory energy of the Lord. Under illusion,
the general mass of people deny the existence of the Supreme Lord and accept the foolish products of
illusory energy as supreme.
One can know the supreme cause, the Personality of Godhead, by the causeless mercy of the Lord,
which is bestowed upon the Lord's pure devotees like Brahma and those in his disciplic succession. By
acts of penance only was Lord Brahma able to see the Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and by realization only
could he understand the Lord as He is. Brahma was extremely satisfied upon observing the magnificent
beauty and opulence of the Lord, and he admitted that nothing can be comparable to Him. Only by
penance can one appreciate the beauty and opulence of the Lord, and when one is acquainted with that
beauty and opulence, he is no longer attracted by any other. This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.59):
param drstva nivartate.
Foolish human beings who do not endeavor to investigate the supreme beauty and opulence of the Lord
are here condemned by Brahma. It is imperative that every human being try for such knowledge, and if
anyone does not do so, his life is spoiled. Anything that is beautiful and opulent in the material sense is
enjoyed by those living entities who are like crows. Crows always engage in picking at rejected garbage,
whereas the white ducks do not mix with the crows. Rather, they take pleasure in transparent lakes with
lotus flowers, surrounded by beautiful orchards. Both crows and ducks are undoubtedly birds by birth,
but they are not of the same feather.
