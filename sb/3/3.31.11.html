<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
atha tam sarva-bhutanam
hrt-padmesu krtalayam
srutanubhavam saranam
vraja bhavena bhamini
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
atha--therefore; tam--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sarva-bhutanam--of all living entities; hrtpadmesu--
in the lotus hearts; krta-alayam--residing; sruta-anubhavam--whose glories you have heard;
saranam--unto the shelter; vraja--go; bhavena--by devotional service; bhamini--My dear mother.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, My dear mother, by devotional service take direct shelter of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is seated in everyone's heart.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One can attain direct contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in full Krsna consciousness and
revive one's eternal relationship with Him as lover, as Supreme Soul, as son, as friend or as master. One
can reestablish the transcendental loving relationship with the Supreme Lord in so many ways, and that
feeling is true oneness. The oneness of the Mayavadi philosophers and the oneness of Vaisnava
philosophers are different. The Mayavadi and Vaisnava philosophers both want to merge into the
Supreme, but the Vaisnavas do not lose their identities. They want to keep the identity of lover, parent,
friend or servant.
In the transcendental world, the servant and master are one. That is the absolute platform. Although the
relationship is servant and master, both the servant and the served stand on the same platform. That is
oneness. Lord Kapila advised His mother that she did not need any indirect process. She was already
situated in that direct process because the Supreme Lord had taken birth as her son. Actually, she did not
need any further instruction because she was already in the perfectional stage. Kapiladeva advised her to
continue in the same way. He therefore addressed His mother as bhamini to indicate that she was already
thinking of the Lord as her son. Devahuti is advised by Lord Kapila to take directly to devotional service,
Krsna consciousness, because without that consciousness one cannot become liberated from the clutches
of maya.
