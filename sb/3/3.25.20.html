<h2>Text</h2>
prasangam ajaram pasam
atmanah kavayo viduh
sa eva sadhusu krto
moksa-dvaram apavrtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
prasangam--attachment; ajaram--strong; pasam--entanglement; atmanah--of the soul; kavayah--learned
men; viduh--know; sah eva--that same; sadhusu--to the devotees; krtah--applied; moksa-dvaram--the door
of liberation; apavrtam--opened.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Every learned man knows very well that attachment for the material is the greatest entanglement of the
spirit soul. But that same attachment, when applied to the self-realized devotees, opens the door of
liberation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here it is clearly stated that attachment for one thing is the cause of bondage in conditioned life, and the
same attachment, when applied to something else, opens the door of liberation. Attachment cannot be
killed; it has simply to be transferred. Attachment for material things is called material consciousness, and
attachment for Krsna or His devotee is called Krsna consciousness. Consciousness, therefore, is the
platform of attachment. It is clearly stated here that when we simply purify the consciousness from
material consciousness to Krsna consciousness, we attain liberation. Despite the statement that one
should give up attachment, desirelessness is not possible for a living entity. A living entity, by
constitution, has the propensity to be attached to something. We see that if someone has no object of
attachment, if he has no children, then he transfers his attachment to cats and dogs. This indicates that
the propensity for attachment cannot be stopped; it must be utilized for the best purpose. Our attachment
for material things perpetuates our conditional state, but the same attachment, when transferred to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, is the source of liberation.
Here it is recommended that attachment should be transferred to the self-realized devotees, the sadhus.
And who is a sadhu? A sadhu is not just an ordinary man with a saffron robe or long beard. A sadhu is
described in Bhagavad-gita as one who unflinchingly engages in devotional service. Even though one is
found not to be following the strict rules and regulations of devotional service, if one simply has
unflinching faith in Krsna, the Supreme Person, he is understood to be a sadhu. Sadhur eva sa mantavyah.
A sadhu is a strict follower of devotional service. It is recommended here that if one at all wants to realize
Brahman, or spiritual perfection, his attachment should be transferred to the sadhu, or devotee. Lord
Caitanya also confirmed this. Lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya: simply by a moment's
association with a sadhu, one can attain perfection.
Mahatma is a synonym of sadhu. It is said that service to a mahatma, or elevated devotee of the Lord, is
dvaram ahur vimukteh, the royal road of liberation. Mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimuktes tamo-dvaram
yositam sangi-sangam (Bhag. 5.5.2). Rendering service to the materialists has the opposite effect. If
anyone offers service to a gross materialist, or a person engaged only in sense enjoyment, then by
association with such a person the door to hell is opened. The same principle is confirmed here.
Attachment to a devotee is attachment to the service of the Lord because if one associates with a sadhu,
the result will be that the sadhu will teach him how to become a devotee, a worshiper and a sincere
servitor of the Lord. These are the gifts of a sadhu. If we want to associate with a sadhu, we cannot expect
him to give us instructions on how to improve our material condition, but he will give us instructions on
how to cut the knot of the contamination of material attraction and how to elevate ourselves in devotional
service. That is the result of associating with a sadhu. Kapila Muni first of all instructs that the path of
liberation begins with such association.
