TRANSLATION
Upon hearing the speaking of her husband, who excelled in knowledge of all kinds of transcendental
science, innocent Devahuti was very satisfied. Her smiling face shining with a slightly bashful glance, she
spoke in a choked voice because of great humility and love.
PURPORT
It is said that if one is already engaged in Krsna consciousness and is rendering transcendental loving
service to the Lord, then it can be supposed that he has finished all the recommended courses of austerity,
penance, religion, sacrifice, mystic yoga and meditation. Devahuti's husband was so expert in the
transcendental science that there was nothing for him to argue about, and when she heard him speak she
was confident that since he was very much advanced in devotional service he had already surpassed all
transcendental educational activities. She had no doubt about the gifts offered by her husband; she knew
that he was expert in offering such gifts, and when she understood that he was offering the greatest gift,
she was very satisfied. She was overwhelmed with ecstatic love, and therefore she could not reply; then,
with faltering language, just like an attractive wife, she spoke the following words.
