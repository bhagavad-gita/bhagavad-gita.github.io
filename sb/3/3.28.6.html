<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah uvaca--Maitreya said; iti--thus; matuh--of His mother; vacah--the words; slaksnam--gentle;
pratinandya--welcoming; maha-munih--the great sage Kapila; ababhase--spoke; kuru-srestha--O best
among the Kurus, Vidura; pritah--pleased; tam--to her; karuna--with compassion; arditah--moved.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: O best amongst the Kurus, the great sage Kapila, moved by great compassion and
pleased by the words of His glorious mother, spoke as follows.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Kapila was very satisfied by the request of His glorious mother because she was thinking not only
in terms of her personal salvation but in terms of all the fallen conditioned souls. The Lord is always
compassionate towards the fallen souls of this material world, and therefore He comes Himself or sends
His confidential servants to deliver them. Since He is perpetually compassionate towards them, if some of
His devotees also become compassionate towards them, He is very pleased with the devotees. In
Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that persons who are trying to elevate the condition of the fallen souls by
preaching the conclusion of Bhagavad-gita--namely, full surrender unto the Personality of Godhead--are
very dear to Him. Thus when the Lord saw that His beloved mother was very compassionate towards the
fallen souls, He was pleased, and He also became compassionate towards her.
