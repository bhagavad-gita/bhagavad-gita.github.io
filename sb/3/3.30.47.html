<h2>Text</h2>
tasman na karyah santraso
na karpanyam na sambhramah
buddhva jiva-gatim dhiro
mukta-sangas cared iha
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasmat--on account of death; na--not; karyah--should be done; santrasah--horror; na--not; karpanyam--
miserliness; na--not; sambhramah--eagerness for material gain; buddhva--realizing; jiva-gatim--the true
nature of the living entity; dhirah--steadfast; mukta-sangah--free from attachment; caret--one should
move about; iha--in this world.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Therefore, one should not view death with horror, nor have recourse to defining the body as soul, nor
give way to exaggeration in enjoying the bodily necessities of life. Realizing the true nature of the living
entity, one should move about in the world free from attachment and steadfast in purpose.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A sane person who has understood the philosophy of life and death is very upset upon hearing of the
horrible, hellish condition of life in the womb of the mother or outside of the mother. But one has to
make a solution to the problems of life. A sane man should understand the miserable condition of this
material body. Without being unnecessarily upset, he should try to find out if there is a remedy. The
remedial measures can be understood when one associates with persons who are liberated. It must be
understood who is actually liberated. The liberated person is described in Bhagavad-gita: one who engages
in uninterrupted devotional service to the Lord, having surpassed the stringent laws of material nature, is
understood to be situated in Brahman.
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond the material creation. It is admitted even by
impersonalists like Sankaracarya that Narayana is transcendental to this material creation. As such, when
one actually engages in the service of the Lord in various forms, either Narayana or Radha-Krsna or SitaRama,
he is understood to be on the platform of liberation. The Bhagavatam also confirms that liberation
means to be situated in one's constitutional position. Since a living entity is eternally the servitor of the
Supreme Lord, when one seriously and sincerely engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord,
he is situated in the position of liberation. One should try to associate with a liberated person, and then
the problems of life, namely birth and death, can be solved.
While discharging devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, one should not be miserly. He should
not unnecessarily show that he has renounced this world. Actually, renunciation is not possible. If one
renounces his palatial building and goes to a forest, there is actually no renunciation, for the palatial
building is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the forest is also the property of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he changes from one property to another, that does not mean that he
renounces; he was never the proprietor of either the palace or the forest. Renunciation necessitates
renouncing the false understanding that one can lord it over material nature. When one renounces this
false attitude and renounces the puffed-up position that he is also God, that is real renunciation.
Otherwise, there is no meaning of renunciation. Rupa Gosvami advises that if one renounces anything
which could be applied in the service of the Lord and does not use it for that purpose, that is called
phalgu-vairagya, insufficient or false renunciation. Everything belongs to the Supreme personality of
Godhead; therefore everything can be engaged in the service of the Lord; nothing should be used for one's
sense gratification. That is real renunciation. Nor should one unnecessarily increase the necessities of the
body. We should be satisfied with whatever is offered and supplied by Krsna without much personal
endeavor. We should spend our time executing devotional service in Krsna consciousness. That is the
solution to the problem of life and death.
