<h2>Text</h2>
praduskrtanam mayanam
asurinam vinasayat
sudarsanastram bhagavan
prayunkta dayitam tri-pat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
praduskrtanam--displayed; mayanam--the magical forces; asurinam--displayed by the demon;
vinasayat--desiring to destroy; sudarsana-astram--the Sudarsana weapon; bhagavan--the Supreme
Personality of Godhead; prayunkta--threw; dayitam--beloved; tri-pat--the enjoyer of all sacrifices.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, the personal enjoyer of all sacrifices, now discharged His beloved Sudarsana, which was
capable of dispersing the magical forces displayed by the demon.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even famous yogis and demons can sometimes enact very magical feats by their mystic power, but in
the presence of the Sudarsana cakra, when it is let loose by the Lord, all such magical jugglery is
dispersed. The instance of the quarrel between Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa is a practical
example in this matter. Durvasa Muni wanted to display many magical wonders, but when the Sudarsana
cakra appeared, Durvasa himself was afraid and fled to various planets for his personal protection. The
Lord is described here as tri-pat, which means that He is the enjoyer of three kinds of sacrifices. In
Bhagavad-gita the Lord confirms that He is the beneficiary and enjoyer of all sacrifices, penances and
austerities. The Lord is the enjoyer of three kinds of yajna. As further described in Bhagavad-gita, there
are sacrifices of goods, sacrifices of meditation and sacrifices of philosophical speculation. Those on the
paths of jnana, yoga and karma all have to come in the end to the Supreme Lord because vasudevah
sarvam iti--the Supreme Lord is the ultimate enjoyer of everything. That is the perfection of all sacrifice.
