<h2>Text</h2>
arabhya saptaman masal
labdha-bodho 'pi vepitah
naikatraste suti-vatair
vistha-bhur iva sodarah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
arabhya--beginning; saptamat masat--from the seventh month; labdha-bodhah--endowed with
consciousness; api--although; vepitah--tossed; na--not; ekatra--in one place; aste--he remains; suti-vataih--
by the winds for childbirth; vistha-bhuh--the worm; iva--like; sa-udarah--born of the same womb.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus endowed with the development of consciousness from the seventh month after his conception, the
child is tossed downward by the airs that press the embryo during the weeks preceding delivery. Like the
worms born of the same filthy abdominal cavity, he cannot remain in one place.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the end of the seventh month the child is moved by the bodily air and does not remain in the same
place, for the entire uterine system becomes slackened before delivery. The worms have been described
here as sodara. Sodara means "born of the same mother." Since the child is born from the womb of the
mother and the worms are also born of fermentation within the womb of the same mother, under the
circumstances the child and the worms are actually brothers. We are very anxious to establish universal
brotherhood among human beings, but we should take into consideration that even the worms are our
brothers, what to speak of other living entities. Therefore, we should be concerned about all living
entities.
