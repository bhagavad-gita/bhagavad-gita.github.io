<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tam--that; tva--You; anubhutya--by realizing; uparata--disregarded; kriya--enjoyment of fruitive
activities; artham--in order that; sva-mayaya--by Your own energy; vartita--brought about; loka-tantram--
the material worlds; namami--I offer obeisances; abhiksnam--continuously; namaniya--worshipable; padasarojam--
lotus feet; alpiyasi--on the insignificant; kama--desires; varsam--showering.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
I continuously offer my respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet, of which it is worthy to take shelter,
because You shower all benedictions on the insignificant. To give all living entities detachment from
fruitive activity by realizing You, You have expanded these material worlds by Your own energy.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Everyone, therefore, whether he desires material enjoyment, liberation or the transcendental loving
service of the Lord, should engage himself, offering obeisances unto the Supreme Lord, because the Lord
can award everyone his desired benediction. In Bhagavad-gita the Lord affirms, ye yatha mam
prapadyante: anyone who desires to be a successful enjoyer in this material world is awarded that
benediction by the Lord, anyone who wants to be liberated from the entanglement of this material world
is given liberation by the Lord, and anyone who desires to constantly engage in His service in full Krsna
consciousness is awarded that benediction by the Lord. For material enjoyment He has prescribed so
many ritualistic sacrificial performances in the Vedas, and thus people may take advantage of those
instructions and enjoy material life in higher planets or in a noble aristocratic family. These processes are
mentioned in the Vedas, and one can take advantage of them. It is similar with those who want to be
liberated from this material world.
Unless one is disgusted with the enjoyment of this material world, he cannot aspire for liberation.
Liberation is for one who is disgusted with material enjoyment. Vedanta-sutra says, therefore, athato
brahma-jijnasa: those who have given up the attempt to be happy in this material world can inquire about
the Absolute Truth. For those who want to know the Absolute Truth, the Vedanta-sutra is available, as is
Srimad-Bhagavatam, the actual explanation of Vedanta-sutra. Since Bhagavad-gita is also Vedanta-sutra,
by understanding Srimad-Bhagavatam, Vedanta-sutra or Bhagavad-gita one can obtain real knowledge.
When one obtains real knowledge, he becomes theoretically one with the Supreme, and when he actually
begins the service of Brahman, or Krsna consciousness, he is not only liberated but situated in his spiritual
life. Similarly, for those who want to lord it over material nature, there are so many departments of
material enjoyment; material knowledge and material science are available, and the Lord provides for
persons who want to enjoy them. The conclusion is that one should worship the Supreme Personality of
Godhead for any benediction. The word kama-varsam is very significant, for it indicates that He satisfies
the desires of anyone who approaches Him. But one who sincerely loves Krsna and yet wants material
enjoyment is in perplexity. Krsna, being very kind toward him, gives him an opportunity to engage in the
transcendental loving service of the Lord, and so he gradually forgets the hallucination.
