<h2>Text</h2>
tad vilokya viyad-vyapi
puskaram yad-adhisthitam
anena lokan prag-linan
kalpitasmity acintayat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tat vilokya--looking into that; viyat-vyapi--extensively widespread; puskaram--the lotus; yat--that which;
adhisthitam--he was situated; anena--by this; lokan--all the planets; prak-linan--previously merged in
dissolution; kalpita asmi--I shall create; iti--thus; acintayat--he thought.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thereafter he saw that the lotus on which he was situated was spread throughout the universe, and he
contemplated how to create all the planets, which were previously merged in that very same lotus.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The seeds of all the planets in the universe were impregnated in the lotus on which Brahma was
situated. All the planets were already generated by the Lord, and all the living entities were also born in
Brahma. The material world and the living entities were all already generated in seedling forms by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahma was to disseminate the same seedlings all over the universe.
The real creation is therefore called sarga, and, later on, the manifestation by Brahma is called visarga.
