<h2>Translation</h2>
At that very moment, the Lord, who is called Padmanabha because of the lotus grown from His navel
and who is the delight of the righteous, learned about the insult offered by His own servants to the saints.
Accompanied by His spouse, the goddess of fortune, He went to the spot on those very feet sought for by
recluses and great sages.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita the Lord declares that His devotees cannot be vanquished at any time. The Lord could
understand that the quarrel between the doormen and the sages was taking a different turn, and therefore
He instantly came out of His place and went to the spot to stop further aggravation so that His devotees,
the doormen, might not be vanquished for good.
