<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The sages said: Who are these two persons who have developed such a discordant mentality even
though they are posted in the service of the Lord in the highest position and are expected to have
developed the same qualities as the Lord? How are these two persons living in Vaikuntha? Where is the
possibility of an enemy's coming into this kingdom of God? The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no
enemy. Who could be envious of Him? Probably these two persons are imposters; therefore they suspect
others to be like themselves.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The difference between the inhabitants of a Vaikuntha planet and those of a material planet is that in
Vaikuntha all the residents engage in the service of the Lord Himself and are equipped with all His good
qualities. It has been analyzed by great personalities that when a conditioned soul is liberated and
becomes a devotee, about seventy-nine percent of all the good qualities of the Lord develop in his person.
Therefore in the Vaikuntha world there is no question of enmity between the Lord and the residents. Here
in this material world the citizens may be inimical to the chief executives or heads of state, but in
Vaikuntha there is no such mentality. One is not allowed to enter Vaikuntha unless he has completely
developed the good qualities. The basic principle of goodness is to accept subordination to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The sages, therefore, were surprised to see that the two doormen who checked
them from entering the palace were not exactly like the residents of Vaikunthaloka. It may be said that a
doorman's duty is to determine who should be allowed to enter the palace and who should not. But that is
not relevant in this matter because no one is allowed to enter the Vaikuntha planets unless he has
developed one hundred percent his mentality of devotional service to the Supreme Lord. No enemy of the
Lord can enter Vaikunthaloka. The Kumaras concluded that the only reason for the doormen's checking
them was that the doormen themselves were imposters.
