<h2>Text</h2>
durbhago bata loko 'yam
yadavo nitaram api
ye samvasanto na vidur
harim mina ivodupam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
durbhagah--unfortunate; bata--certainly; lokah--universe; ayam--this; yadavah--the Yadu dynasty;
nitaram--more specifically; api--also; ye--those; samvasantah--living together; na--did not; viduh--

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This universe with all its planets is most unfortunate. And even more unfortunate are the members of
the Yadu dynasty because they could not identify Lord Hari as the Personality of Godhead, any more than
the fish could identify the moon.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Uddhava lamented for the unfortunate persons of the world who could not recognize Lord Sri Krsna in
spite of seeing all His transcendental godly qualities. From the very beginning of His appearance within
the prison bars of King Kamsa up to His mausala-lila, although He exhibited His potencies as the
Personality of Godhead in the six opulences of wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and
renunciation, the foolish persons of the world could not understand that He was the Supreme Lord,
Foolish persons might have thought Him an extraordinary historic figure because they had no intimate
touch with the Lord, but more unfortunate were the family members of the Lord, the members of the
Yadu dynasty, who were always in company with the Lord but were unable to recognize Him as the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Uddhava lamented his own fortune also because although he knew
Krsna to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not properly use the opportunity to render
devotional service to the Lord. He regretted everyone's misfortune, including his own. The pure devotee
of the Lord thinks himself most unfortunate. That is due to excessive love for the Lord and is one of the
transcendental perceptions of viraha, the suffering of separation.
It is learned from the revealed scriptures that the moon was born from the milk ocean. There is a milk
ocean in the upper planets, and there Lord Visnu, who controls the heart of every living being as
Paramatma (the Supersoul), resides as the Ksirodakasayi Visnu. Those who do not believe in the existence
of the ocean of milk because they have experience only of the salty water in the ocean should know that
the world is also called the go, which means the cow. The urine of a cow is salty, and according to Ayurvedic
medicine the cow's urine is very effective in treating patients suffering from liver trouble. Such
patients may not have any experience of the cow's milk because milk is never given to liver patients. But
the liver patient may know that the cow has milk also, although he has never tasted it. Similarly, men who
have experience only of this tiny planet where the saltwater ocean exists may take information from the
revealed scriptures that there is also an ocean of milk, although we have never seen it. From this ocean of
milk the moon was born, but the fish in the milk ocean could not recognize that the moon. was not
another fish and was different from them. The fish took the moon to be one of them or maybe something
illuminating, but nothing more. The unfortunate persons who do not recognize Lord Krsna are like such
fish. They take Him to be one of them, although a little extraordinary in opulence, strength, etc. The
Bhagavad-gita (9.11) confirms such foolish persons to be most unfortunate: avajananti mam mudha
manusim tanum asritam.
