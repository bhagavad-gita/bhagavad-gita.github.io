<h2>Translation</h2>
O my lord, I have repeatedly heard about these higher and lower statuses of human society from the
mouth of Vyasadeva, and I am quite satiated with all these lesser subject matters and their happiness.
They have not satisfied me with the nectar of topics about Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Because people are very much interested in hearing social and historical presentations, Srila Vyasadeva
has compiled many books such as the Puranas and Mahabharata. These books are reading matter for the
mass of people, and they were compiled with a view to reviving their God consciousness, now forgotten
in the conditional life of material existence. The real purpose of such literatures is not so much to present
topics of historical references, but to revive the people's sense of God consciousness. For example,
Mahabharata is the history of the Battle of Kuruksetra, and common people read it because it is full of
topics regarding the social, political and economic problems of human society. But factually the most
important part of Mahabharata is Bhagavad-gita, which is automatically taught to readers along with the
historical narrations of the Battle of Kuruksetra.
Vidura explained to Maitreya his position of being fully satiated with the knowledge of mundane social
and political topics and having no more interest in them. He was anxious to hear transcendental topics
regarding Lord Sri Krsna. Because there were insufficient topics directly concerning Krsna in the Puranas,
Mahabharata, etc., he was not satisfied and wanted to know more about Krsna. Krsna-katha, or topics
regarding Krsna, are transcendental, and there is no satiation in hearing such topics. Bhagavad-gita is
important on account of its being krsna-katha, or speeches delivered by Lord Krsna. The story of the
Battle of Kuruksetra may be interesting for the mass of people, but to a person like Vidura, who is highly
advanced in devotional service, only krsna-katha and that which is dovetailed with krsna-katha is
interesting. Vidura wanted to hear of everything from Maitreya, and so he inquired from him, but he
desired that all the topics be in relationship with Krsna. As fire is never satisfied in its consumption of
firewood, so a pure devotee of the Lord never hears enough about Krsna. Historical events and other
narrations concerning social and political incidents all become transcendental as soon as they are in
relationship with Krsna. That is the way to transform mundane things into spiritual identity. The whole
world can be transformed into Vaikuntha if all worldly activities are dovetailed with krsna-katha.
There are two important krsna-kathas current in the world--Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Bhagavad-gita is krsna-katha because it is spoken by Krsna, whereas Srimad-Bhagavatam is krsna-katha
because it narrates about Krsna. Lord Caitanya advised all His disciples to preach krsna-katha all over the
world without discrimination because the transcendental value of krsna-katha can purify one and all from
material contamination.
