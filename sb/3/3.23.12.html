<h2>Text</h2>
maitreya uvaca
priyayah priyam anvicchan
kardamo yogam asthitah
vimanam kama-gam ksattas
tarhy evaviracikarat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
maitreyah--the great sage Maitreya; uvaca--said; priyayah--of his beloved wife; priyam--the pleasure;
anvicchan--seeking; kardamah--the sage Kardama; yogam--yogic power; asthitah--exercised; vimanam--an
airplane; kama-gam--moving at will; ksattah--O Vidura; tarhi--instantly; eva--quite; aviracikarat--he
produced.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Maitreya continued: O Vidura, seeking to please his beloved wife, the sage Kardama exercised his yogic
power and instantly produced an aerial mansion that could travel at his will.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here the words yogam asthitah are significant. The sage Kardama was completely perfect in yoga. As the
result of real yoga practice there are eight kinds of perfection: the yogi can become smaller than the
smallest, greater than the greatest or lighter than the lightest, he can achieve anything he likes, he can
create even a planet, he can establish influence over anyone, etc. In this way yogic perfection is achieved,
and after this one can achieve the perfection of spiritual life. Thus it was not very wonderful for Kardama
Muni to create a mansion in the air, according to his own desire, to fulfill the desire of his beloved wife.
He at once created the palace, which is described in the following verses.
