TRANSLATION
First of all, Brahma created from his shadow the coverings of ignorance of the conditioned souls. They
are five in number and are called tamisra, andha-tamisra, tamas, moha and maha-moha.
PURPORT
The conditioned souls, or living entities who come to the material world to enjoy sense gratification, are
covered in the beginning by five different conditions. The first condition is a covering of tamisra, or anger.
Constitutionally, each and every living entity has minute independence; it is misuse of that minute
independence for the conditioned soul to think that he can also enjoy like the Supreme Lord or to think,
"Why shall I not be a free enjoyer like the Supreme Lord?" This forgetfulness of his constitutional
position is due to anger or envy. The living entity, being eternally a part-and-parcel servitor of the
Supreme Lord, can never, by constitution, be an equal enjoyer with the Lord. When he forgets this,
however, and tries to be one with Him, his condition is called tamisra. Even in the field of spiritual
realization, this tamisra mentality of the living entity is hard to overcome. In trying to get out of the
entanglement of material life, there are many who want to be one with the Supreme. Even in their
transcendental activities, this lower-grade mentality of tamisra continues.
Andha-tamisra involves considering death to be the ultimate end. The atheists generally think that the
body is the self and that everything is therefore ended with the end of the body. Thus they want to enjoy
material life as far as possible during the existence of the body. Their theory is: "As long as you live, you
should live prosperously. Never mind whether you commit all kinds of so-called sins. You must eat
sumptuously. Beg, borrow and steal, and if you think that by stealing and borrowing you are being
entangled in sinful activities for which you will have to pay, then just forget that misconception because
after death everything is finished. No one is responsible for anything he does during his life." This
atheistic conception of life is killing human civilization, for it is without knowledge of the continuation of
eternal life.
This andha-tamisra ignorance is due to tamas. The condition of not knowing anything about the spirit
soul is called tamas. This material world is also generally called tamas because ninety-nine percent of its
living entities are ignorant of their identity as soul. Almost everyone is thinking that he is this body; he
has no information of the spirit soul. Guided by this misconception, one always thinks, "This is my body,
and anything in relationship with this body is mine." For such misguided living entities, sex life is the
background of material existence. Actually, the conditioned souls, in ignorance in this material world, are
simply guided by sex life, and as soon as they get the opportunity for sex life, they become attached to socalled
home, motherland, children, wealth and opulence. As these attachments increase, moha, or the
illusion of the bodily concept of life, also increases. Thus the idea that "I am this body, and everything
belonging to this body is mine" also increases, and as the whole world is put into moha, sectarian
societies, families and nationalities are created, and they fight with one another. Maha-moha means to be
mad after material enjoyment. Especially in this age of Kali, everyone is overwhelmed by the madness to
accumulate paraphernalia for material enjoyment. These definitions are very nicely given in Visnu Purana,
wherein it is said:
tamo 'viveko mohah syad
antah-karana-vibhramah
maha-mohas tu vijneyo
gramya-bhoga-sukhaisana
maranam hy andha-tamisram
tamisram krodha ucyate
avidya panca-parvaisa
pradurbhuta mahatmanah
