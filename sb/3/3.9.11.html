<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, Your devotees can see You through the ears by the process of bona fide hearing, and thus
their hearts become cleansed, and You take Your seat there. You are so merciful to Your devotees that You
manifest Yourself in the particular eternal form of transcendence in which they always think of You.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The statement here that the Lord manifests Himself before the devotee in the form in which the devotee
likes to worship Him indicates that the Lord becomes subordinate to the desire of the devotee--so much
so that He manifests His particular form as the devotee demands. This demand of the devotee is satisfied
by the Lord because He is pliable in terms of the transcendental loving service of the devotee. This is also
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.11): ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham. We should
note, however, that the Lord is never the order supplier of the devotee. Here in this verse it is particularly
mentioned: tvam bhakti-yoga-paribhavita. This indicates the efficiency achieved through execution of
matured devotional service, or prema, love of Godhead. This state of prema is achieved by the gradual
process of development from faith to love. On faith one associates with bona fide devotees, and by such
association one can become engaged in bona fide devotional service, which includes proper initiation and
the execution of the primary devotional duties prescribed in the revealed scriptures. This is clearly
indicated herein by the word sruteksita. The sruteksita path is to hear from bona fide devotees who are
conversant with Vedic wisdom, free from mundane sentiment. By this bona fide hearing process, the
neophyte devotee becomes cleansed of all material rubbish, and thus he becomes attached to one of the
many transcendental forms of the Lord, as described in the Vedas.
This attachment of the devotee to a particular form of the Lord is due to natural inclination. Each and
every living entity is originally attached to a particular type of transcendental service because he is
eternally the servitor of the Lord. Lord Caitanya says that the living entity is eternally a servitor of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna. Therefore, every living entity has a particular type of service
relationship with the Lord, eternally. This particular attachment is invoked by practice of regulative
devotional service to the Lord, and thus the devotee becomes attached to the eternal form of the Lord,
exactly like one who is already eternally attached. This attachment for a particular form of the Lord is
called svarupa-siddhi. The Lord sits on the lotus heart of the devotee in the eternal form the pure devotee
desires, and thus the Lord does not part from the devotee, as confirmed in the previous verse. The Lord,
however, does not disclose Himself to a casual or unauthentic worshiper to be exploited. This is
confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.25): naham prakasah sarvasya yoga-maya-samavrtah. Rather, by yogamaya,
the Lord remains concealed to the nondevotees or casual devotees who are serving their sense
gratification. The Lord is never visible to the pseudodevotees who worship the demigods in charge of
universal affairs. The conclusion is that the Lord cannot become the order supplier of a pseudodevotee,
but He is always prepared to respond to the desires of a pure, unconditional devotee, who is free from all
tinges of material infection.
