<h2>Translation</h2>
Spotless devotees of the Lord have mentioned the source of such knowledge. How could one have
knowledge of devotional service and detachment without the help of such devotees?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are many inexperienced persons who advocate self-realization without the help of a spiritual
master. They decry the necessity of the spiritual master and try themselves to take his place by
propagating the theory that a spiritual master is not necessary. Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, does not
approve this viewpoint. Even the great transcendental scholar Vyasadeva had need of a spiritual master,
and under the instruction of his spiritual master, Narada, he prepared this sublime literature, Srimad-
Bhagavatam. Even Lord Caitanya, although He is Krsna Himself, accepted a spiritual master; even Lord
Krsna accepted a spiritual master, Sandipani Muni, in order to be enlightened; and all the acaryas and
saints of the world had spiritual masters. In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna accepted Lord Krsna as his spiritual
master, although there was no necessity of such a formal declaration. So, in all cases, there is no question
about the necessity of accepting a spiritual master. The only stipulation is that the spiritual master should
be bona fide; i.e., the spiritual master must be in the proper chain of disciplic succession, called the
parampara system.
Suris are great scholars, but they may not always be anagha, or spotless. The anagha-suri is one who is a
pure devotee of the Lord. Those who are not pure devotees of the Lord, or who want to be on an equal
level with Him, are not anagha-suri. Pure devotees have prepared many books of knowledge on the basis
of authorized scriptures. Srila Rupa Gosvami and his assistants, under the instructions of Lord Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu, have all written various literatures for the guidance of prospective devotees, and
anyone who is very serious about raising himself to the standard of a pure devotee of the Lord must take
advantage of those literatures.
