<h2>Text</h2>
yat-prasadad idam visvam
prasidati yad-atmakam
sa sva-drg bhagavan yasya
tosyate 'nanyaya drsa
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yat--by whose; prasadat--mercy of; idam--this; visvam--universe; prasidati--becomes happy; yat--whose;
atmakam--because of His omnipotence; sah--He; sva-drk--taking special care for His devotees; bhagavan--
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yasya--whose; tosyate--becomes pleased; ananyaya--without
deviation; drsa--by intelligence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Everyone will be pleased with him because the Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller of the
universe, is always satisfied with a devotee who does not wish for anything beyond Him.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated everywhere as the Supersoul, and He can dictate to
anyone and everyone as He likes. The would-be grandson of Diti, who was predicted to be a great devotee,
would be liked by everyone, even by the enemies of his father, because he would have no other vision
besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure devotee of the Lord sees the presence of his
worshipable Lord everywhere. The Lord reciprocates in such a way that all living entities in whom the
Lord is dwelling as the Supersoul also like a pure devotee because the Lord is present in their hearts and
can dictate to them to be friendly to His devotee. There are many instances in history wherein even the
most ferocious animal became friendly to a pure devotee of the Lord.
