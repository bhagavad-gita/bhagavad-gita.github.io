<h2>Text</h2>
sa capi tanayoktena
yogadesena yoga-yuk
tasminn asrama apide
sarasvatyah samahita
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sa--she; ca--and; api--also; tanaya--by her son; uktena--spoken; yoga-adesena--by the instruction on
yoga; yoga-yuk--engaged in bhakti-yoga; tasmin--in that; asrame--hermitage; apide--the flower crown;
sarasvatyah--of the Sarasvati; samahita--fixed in samadhi.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As instructed by her son, Devahuti also began to practice bhakti-yoga in that very asrama. She practiced
samadhi in the house of Kardama Muni, which was so beautifully decorated with flowers that it was
considered the flower crown of the River Sarasvati.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti did not leave her house, because it is never recommended for a woman to leave her home. She
is dependent. The very example of Devahuti was that when she was not married, she was under the care
of her father, Svayambhuva Manu, and then Svayambhuva Manu gave her to Kardama Muni in charity.
She was under the care of her husband in her youth, and then her son, Kapila Muni, was born. As soon as
her son grew up, her husband left home, and similarly the son, after discharging His duty towards His
mother, also left. She could also have left home, but she did not. Rather, she remained at home and began
to practice bhakti-yoga as it was instructed by her great son, Kapila Muni, and because of her practice of
bhakti-yoga, the entire home became just like a flower crown on the River Sarasvati.
