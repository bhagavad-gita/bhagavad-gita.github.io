<h2>Text</h2>
tada visvesvarah kruddho
bhagaval loka-bhavanah
hanisyaty avatiryasau
yathadrin sataparva-dhrk
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tada--at that time; visva-isvarah--the Lord of the universe; kruddhah--in great anger; bhagavan--the
Supreme Personality of Godhead; loka-bhavanah--desiring the welfare of the people in general; hanisyati--
will kill; avatirya--descending Himself; asau--He; yatha--as if; adrin--the mountains; sata-parva-dhrk--the
controller of the thunderbolt (Indra).
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
At that time the Lord of the universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the well-wisher of all
living entities, will descend and kill them, just as Indra smashes the mountains with his thunderbolts.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), the Lord descends as an incarnation to deliver the devotees and kill the
miscreants. The Lord of the universe and of everything would appear to kill the sons of Diti because of
their offending the devotees of the Lord. There are many agents of the Lord, such as Indra, Candra,
Varuna, goddess Durga, and Kali, who can chastise any formidable miscreants in the world. The example
of mountains being smashed by a thunderbolt is very appropriate. The mountain is considered the most
strongly built body within the universe, yet it can be easily smashed by the arrangement of the Supreme
Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not need to descend in order to kill any strongly built
body; He comes down just for the sake of His devotees. Everyone is subject to the miseries offered by
material nature, but because the activities of miscreants, such as killing innocent people and animals or
torturing women, are harmful to everyone and are therefore a source of pain for the devotees, the Lord
comes down. He descends only to give relief to His ardent devotees. The killing of the miscreant by the
Lord is also the mercy of the Lord towards the miscreant, although apparently the Lord takes the side of
the devotee. Since the Lord is absolute, there is no difference between His activities of killing the
miscreants and favoring the devotees.
