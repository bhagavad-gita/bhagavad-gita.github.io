<h2>Text</h2>
dvisatah para-kaye mam

<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dvisatah--of one who is envious; para-kaye--towards the body of another; mam--unto Me; maninah--
offering respect; bhinna-darsinah--of a separatist; bhutesu--towards living entities; baddha-vairasya--of
one who is inimical; na--not; manah--the mind; santim--peace; rcchati--attains.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who offers Me respect but is envious of the bodies of others and is therefore a separatist never
attains peace of mind, because of his inimical behavior towards other living entities.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In this verse, two phrases, bhutesu baddha-vairasya ("inimical towards others") and dvisatah para-kaye
("envious of another's body"), are significant. One who is envious of or inimical towards others never
experiences any happiness. A devotee's vision, therefore, must be perfect. He should ignore bodily
distinctions and should see only the presence of the part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord
Himself in His plenary expansion as Supersoul. That is the vision of a pure devotee. The bodily expression
of a particular type of living entity is always ignored by the devotee.
It is expressed herein that the Lord is always eager to deliver the conditioned souls, who have been
encaged within material bodies. Devotees are expected to carry the message or desire of the Lord to such
conditioned souls and enlighten them with Krsna consciousness. Thus they may be elevated to
transcendental, spiritual life, and the mission of their lives will be successful. Of course this is not possible
for living entities who are lower than human beings, but in human society it is feasible that all living
entities can be enlightened with Krsna consciousness. Even living entities who are lower than human can
be raised to Krsna consciousness by other methods. For example, Sivananda Sena, a great devotee of Lord
Caitanya, delivered a dog by feeding him prasada. Distribution of prasada, or remnants of foodstuffs
offered to the Lord, even to the ignorant masses of people and to animals, gives such living entities the
chance for elevation to Krsna consciousness. Factually it happened that the same dog, when met by Lord
Caitanya at Puri, was liberated from the material condition.
It is especially mentioned here that a devotee must be free from all violence (jivahimsa). Lord Caitanya
has recommended that a devotee not commit violence to any living entity. Sometimes the question is
raised that since vegetables also have life and devotees take vegetable foodstuffs, isn't that violence?
Firstly, however, taking some leaves, twigs or fruit from a tree or plant does not kill the plant. Besides
that, jivahimsa means that since every living entity has to pass through a particular type of body according
to his past karma, although every living entity is eternal, he should not be disturbed in his gradual
evolution. A devotee has to execute the principles of devotional service exactly as they are, and he must
know that however insignificant a living entity may be, the Lord is present within him. A devotee must
realize this universal presence of the Lord.
