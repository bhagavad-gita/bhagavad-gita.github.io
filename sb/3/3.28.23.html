<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The yogi should fix in his heart the activities of Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, who is worshiped by all
demigods and is the mother of the supreme person, Brahma. She can always be found massaging the legs
and thighs of the transcendental Lord, very carefully serving Him in this way.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahma is the appointed lord of the universe. Because his father is Garbhodakasayi Visnu, Laksmi, the
goddess of fortune, is automatically his mother. Laksmiji is worshiped by all demigods and by the
inhabitants of other planets as well. Human beings are also eager to receive favor from the goddess of
fortune. Laksmi is always engaged in massaging the legs and thighs of the Supreme personality of
Godhead Narayana, who is lying on the ocean of Garbha within the universe. Brahma is described here as
the son of the goddess of fortune, but actually he was not born of her womb. Brahma takes his birth from
the abdomen of the Lord Himself. A lotus flower grows from the abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and
Brahma is born there. Therefore Laksmiji's massaging of the thighs of the Lord should not be taken as the
behavior of an ordinary wife. The Lord is transcendental to the behavior of the ordinary male and female.
The word abhavasya is very significant, for it indicates that He could produce Brahma without the
assistance of the goddess of fortune.
Since transcendental behavior is different from mundane behavior, it should not be taken that the Lord
receives service from His wife just as a demigod or human being might receive service from his wife. It is
advised here that the yogi always keep this picture in his heart. The devotee always thinks of this
relationship between Laksmi and Narayana; therefore he does not meditate on the mental plane as
impersonalists and voidists do.
Bhava means "one who accepts a material body," and abhava means "one who does not accept a material
body but descends in the original, spiritual body." Lord Narayana is not born of anything material. Matter
is generated from matter, but He is not born of matter. Brahma is born after the creation, but since the
Lord existed before the creation, the Lord has no material body.
