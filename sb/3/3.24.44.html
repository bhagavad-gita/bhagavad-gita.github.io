<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus he gradually became unaffected by the false ego of material identity and became free from material
affection. Undisturbed, equal to everyone and without duality, he could indeed see himself also. His mind
was turned inward and was perfectly calm, like an ocean unagitated by waves.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When one's mind is in full Krsna consciousness and one fully engages in rendering devotional service to
the Lord, he becomes just like an ocean unagitated by waves. This very example is also cited in Bhagavadgita:
one should become like the ocean. The ocean is filled by many thousands of rivers, and millions of
tons of its water evaporates into clouds, yet the ocean is the same unagitated ocean. The laws of nature
may work, but if one is fixed in devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord, he is not agitated, for he is
introspective. He does not look outside to material nature, but he looks in to the spiritual nature of his
existence; with a sober mind, he simply engages in the service of the Lord. Thus he realizes his own self
without false identification with matter and without affection for material possessions. Such a great
devotee is never in trouble with others because he sees everyone from the platform of spiritual
understanding; he sees himself and others in the right perspective.
