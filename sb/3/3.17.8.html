TRANSLATION
I do not enjoy the oblations offered by the sacrificers in the sacrificial fire, which is one of My own
mouths, with the same relish as I do the delicacies overflowing with ghee which are offered to the mouths
of the brahmanas who have dedicated to Me the results of their activities and who are ever satisfied with
My prasada.
PURPORT
The devotee of the Lord, or the Vaisnava, does not take anything without offering it to the Lord. Since a
Vaisnava dedicates all the results of his activities to the Lord, he does not taste anything eatable which is
not first offered to Him. The Lord also relishes giving to the Vaisnava's mouth all eatables offered to Him.
It is clear from this verse that the Lord eats through the sacrificial fire and the brahmana's mouth. So
many articles--grains, ghee, etc.--are offered in sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. The Lord accepts
sacrificial offerings from the brahmanas and devotees, and elsewhere it is stated that whatever is given for
the brahmanas and Vaisnavas to eat is also accepted by the Lord. But here it is said that He accepts
offerings to the mouths of brahmanas and Vaisnavas with even greater relish. The best example of this is
found in the life of Advaita Prabhu in his dealings with Haridasa Thakura. Even though Haridasa was
born of a Muhammadan family, Advaita Prabhu offered him the first dish of prasada after the performance
of a sacred fire ceremony. Haridasa Thakura informed him that he was born of a Muhammadan family and
asked why Advaita Prabhu was offering the first dish to a Muhammadan instead of an elevated brahmana.
Out of his humbleness, Haridasa condemned himself a Muhammadan, but Advaita Prabhu, being an
experienced devotee, accepted him as a real brahmana. Advaita Prabhu asserted that by offering the first
dish to Haridasa Thakura, he was getting the result of feeding one hundred thousand brahmanas. The
conclusion is that if one can feed a brahmana or Vaisnava, it is better than performing hundreds of
thousands of sacrifices. In this age, therefore, it is recommended that harer nama--chanting the holy name
of God--and pleasing the Vaisnava are the only means to elevate oneself to spiritual life.
