<h2>Text</h2>
srutasya pumsam sucira-sramasya
nanv anjasa suribhir idito 'rthah
tat-tad-gunanusravanam mukundapadaravindam
hrdayesu yesam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
srutasya--of persons who are in the process of hearing; pumsam--of such persons; sucira--for a long
time; sramasya--laboring very hard; nanu--certainly; anjasa--elaborately; suribhih--by pure devotees;
iditah--explained by; arthah--statements; tat--that; tat--that; guna--transcendental qualities;
anusravanam--thinking; mukunda--the Personality of Godhead, who awards liberation; pada-aravindam--
the lotus feet; hrdayesu--within the heart; yesam--of them.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who hear from a spiritual master with great labor and for a long time must hear from the
mouths of pure devotees about the character and activities of pure devotees. Pure devotees always think
within their hearts of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, who awards His devotees liberation.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Transcendental students are those who undergo great penance in being trained by hearing the Vedas
from a bona fide spiritual master. Not only must they hear about the activities of the Lord, but they must
also hear about the transcendental qualities of the devotees who are constantly thinking of the lotus feet
of the Lord within their hearts. A pure devotee of the Lord cannot be separated from the lotus feet of the
Lord for even a moment. Undoubtedly the Lord is always within the hearts of all living creatures, but they
hardly know about it because they are deluded by the illusory material energy. The devotees, however,
realize the presence of the Lord, and therefore they can always see the lotus feet of the Lord within their
hearts. Such pure devotees of the Lord are as glorious as the Lord; they are, in fact, recommended by the
Lord as more worshipable then He Himself. Worship of the devotee is more potent than worship of the
Lord. It is therefore the duty of the transcendental students to hear of pure devotees, as explained by
similar devotees of the Lord, because one cannot explain about the Lord or His devotee unless one
happens to be a pure devotee himself.
