<h2>Text</h2>
mukta-lingam sad-abhasam
asati pratipadyate
sato bandhum asac-caksuh
sarvanusyutam advayam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
mukta-lingam--transcendental; sat-abhasam--manifest as a reflection; asati--in the false ego;
pratipadyate--he realizes; satah bandhum--the support of the material cause; asat-caksuh--the eye
(revealer) of the illusory energy; sarva-anusyutam--entered into everything; advayam--without a second.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
A liberated soul realizes the Absolute Personality of Godhead, who is transcendental and who is
manifest as a reflection even in the false ego. He is the support of the material cause and He enters into
everything. He is absolute, one without a second, and He is the eyes of the illusory energy.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
A pure devotee can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in everything materially
manifested. He is present there only as a reflection, but a pure devotee can realize that in the darkness of
material illusion the only light is the Supreme Lord, who is its support. It is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita
that the background of the material manifestation is Lord Krsna. And, as confirmed in the Brahmasamhita,
Krsna is the cause of all causes. In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Supreme Lord, by His
partial or plenary expansion, is present not only within this universe and each and every universe, but in
every atom, although He is one without a second. The word advayam, "without a second," which is used
in this verse, indicates that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is represented in everything,
including the atoms, He is not divided. His presence in everything is explained in the next verse.
