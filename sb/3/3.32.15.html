<h2>Text</h2>
prajapateh kardamasya
tapo-yoga-vijrmbhitam
sva-garhasthyam anaupamyam
prarthyam vaimanikair api
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
praja-pateh--of the progenitor of mankind; kardamasya--Kardama Muni; tapah--by austerity; yoga--by
yoga; vijrmbhitam--developed; sva-garhasthyam--his home and household paraphernalia; anaupamyam--
unequaled; prarthyam--enviable; vaimanikaih--by the denizens of heaven; api--even.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The home and household paraphernalia of Kardama, who was one of the Prajapatis, was developed in
such a way, by dint of his mystic powers of austerity and yoga, that his opulence was sometimes envied by
those who travel in outer space in airplanes.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The statement in this verse that Kardama Muni's household affairs were envied even by persons who
travel in outer space refers to the denizens of heaven. Their airships are not like those we have invented in
the modern age, which fly only from one country to another; their airplanes were capable of going from
one planet to another. There are many such statements in the Srimad-Bhagavatam from which we can
understand that there were facilities to travel from one planet to another, especially in the higher
planetary system, and who can say that they are not still traveling? The speed of our airplanes and space
vehicles is very limited, but, as we have already studied, Kardama Muni traveled in outer space in an
airplane which was like a city, and he journeyed to see all the different heavenly planets. That was not an
ordinary airplane, nor was it ordinary space travel. Because Kardama Muni was such a powerful mystic
yogi, his opulence was envied by the denizens of heaven.
