<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
imam lokam amum caiva
ramayan sutaram yadun
reme ksanadaya dattaksana-
stri-ksana-sauhrdah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
imam--this; lokam--earth; amum--and the other worlds; ca--also; eva--certainly; ramayan--pleasing;
sutaram--specifically; yadun--the Yadus; reme--enjoyed; ksanadaya--by night; datta--given by; ksana--
leisure; stri--with women; ksana--conjugal love; sauhrdah--friendship.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord enjoyed His pastimes, both in this world and in other worlds [higher planets], specifically in
the association of the Yadu dynasty. At leisure hours offered by night, He enjoyed the friendship of
conjugal love with women.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord enjoyed in this world with His pure devotees. Although He is the Personality of Godhead and
is transcendental to all material attachment, He nevertheless exhibited much attachment for His pure
devotees on the earth, as well as for the demigods who engage in His service in the heavenly planets as
powerful delegated directors in the management of all material activities. He displayed special attachment
for His family members, the Yadus, as well as for His sixteen thousand wives, who had the opportunity to
meet Him in the leisure hours of night. All these attachments of the Lord are manifestations of His
internal potency, of which the external potency is only a shadow representation. In the Skanda Purana,
Prabhasa-khanda, in the topics between Lord Siva and Gauri, there is confirmation of His internal
potential manifestations. There is mention of the Lord's meeting with sixteen thousand cowherd damsels
although He is the Hamsa (transcendental) Supersoul and maintainer of all living entities. The sixteen
thousand cowherd damsels are a display of sixteen varieties of internal potencies. This will be more
elaborately explained in the Tenth Canto. It is said there that Lord Krsna is just like the moon and the
internal potential damsels are like the stars around the moon.
