<h2>Text</h2>
bhavanam brahmanah sthanam
dharanam sad-visesanam
sarva-sattva-gunodbhedah
prthivi-vrtti-laksanam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhavanam--modeling forms; brahmanah--of the Supreme Brahman; sthanam--constructing places of
residence; dharanam--containing substances; sat-visesanam--distinguishing the open space; sarva--all;
sattva--of existence; guna--qualities; udbhedah--the place for manifestation; prthivi--of earth; vrtti--of the
functions; laksanam--the characteristics.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The characteristics of the functions of earth can be perceived by modeling forms of the Supreme
Brahman, by constructing places of residence, by preparing pots to contain water, etc. In other words, the
earth is the place of sustenance for all elements.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Different elements, such as sound, sky, air, fire and water, can be perceived in the earth. Another feature
of the earth especially mentioned here is that earth can manifest different forms of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. By this statement of Kapila's it is confirmed that the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Brahman, has innumerable forms, which are described in the scriptures. By manipulation of
earth and its products, such as stone, wood and jewels, these forms of the Supreme Lord can be present
before our eyes. When a form of Lord Krsna or Lord Visnu is manifested by presentation of a statue made
of earth, it is not imaginary. The earth gives shape to the Lord's forms as described in the scriptures.
In the Brahma-samhita there is description of Lord Krsna's lands, the variegatedness of the spiritual
abode, and the forms of the Lord playing a flute with His spiritual body. All these forms are described in
the scriptures, and when they are thus presented they become worshipable. They are not imaginary as the
Mayavada philosophy says. Sometimes the word bhavana is misinterpreted as "imagination." But bhavana
does not mean "imagination;" it means giving actual shape to the description of Vedic literature. Earth is
the ultimate transformation of all living entities and their respective modes of material nature.
