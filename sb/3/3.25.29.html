<h2>Translation</h2>
The mystic yoga system, as You have explained, aims at the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is
meant for completely ending material existence. Please let me know the nature of that yoga system. How
many ways are there by which one can understand in truth that sublime yoga?
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
There are different kinds of mystic yoga systems aiming for different phases of the Absolute Truth. The
jnana-yoga system aims at the impersonal Brahman effulgence, and the hatha-yoga system aims at the
localized personal aspect, the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas bhakti-yoga, or
devotional service, which is executed in nine different ways, headed by hearing and chanting, aims at
complete realization of the Supreme Lord. There are different methods of self-realization. But here
Devahuti especially refers to the bhakti-yoga system, which has already been primarily explained by the
Lord. The different parts of the bhakti-yoga system are hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers,
worshiping the Lord in the temple, accepting service to Him, carrying out His orders, making friendship
with Him and ultimately surrendering everything for the service of the Lord. The word nirvanatman is
very significant in this verse. Unless one accepts the process of devotional service, one cannot end the
continuation of material existence. As far as jnanis are concerned, they are interested in jnana-yoga, but
even if one elevates oneself, after a great performance of austerity, to the Brahman effulgence, there is a
chance of falling down again to the material world. Therefore, jnana-yoga does not actually end material
existence. Similarly, regarding the hatha-yoga system, which aims at the localized aspect of the Lord,
Paramatma, it has been experienced that many yogis, such as Visvamitra, fall down. But bhakti-yogis,
once approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never come back to this material world, as it is
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita. Yad gatva na nivartante: upon going, one never comes back. Tyaktva
deham punar janma naiti: after giving up this body, he never comes back again to accept a material body.
Nirvana does not finish the existence of the soul. The soul is ever existing. Therefore nirvana means to
end one's material existence, and to end material existence means to go back home, back to Godhead.
Sometimes it is asked how the living entity falls down from the spiritual world to the material world.
Here is the answer. Unless one is elevated to the Vaikuntha planets, directly in touch with the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, he is prone to fall down, either from the impersonal Brahman realization or from
an ecstatic trance of meditation. Another word in this verse, bhagavad-banah, is very significant. Banah
means "arrow." The bhakti-yoga system is just like an arrow aiming up to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The bhakti-yoga system never urges one towards the impersonal Brahman effulgence or to the
point of Paramatma realization. This banah, or arrow, is so sharp and swift that it goes directly to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, penetrating the regions of impersonal Brahman and localized
Paramatma.
