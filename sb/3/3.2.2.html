<h2>Translation</h2>
He was one who even in his childhood, at the age of five years, was so absorbed in the service of Lord
Krsna that when he was called by his mother for morning breakfast, he did not wish to have it.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
From his very birth, Uddhava was a natural devotee of Lord Krsna, or a nitya-siddha, a liberated soul.
From natural instinct he used to serve Lord Krsna, even in his childhood. He used to play with dolls in
the form of Krsna, he would serve the dolls by dressing, feeding and worshiping them, and thus he was
constantly absorbed in the play of transcendental realization. These are the signs of an eternally liberated
soul. An eternally liberated soul is a devotee of the Lord who never forgets Him. Human life is meant for
reviving one's eternal relation with the Lord, and all religious injunctions are meant for awakening this
dormant instinct of the living entity. The sooner this awakening is brought about, the quicker the mission
of human life is fulfilled. In a good family of devotees, the child gets the opportunity to serve the Lord in
many ways. A soul who is already advanced in devotional service has the opportunity to take birth in such
an enlightened family. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (6.41). Sucinam srimatam gehe yogabhrasto
'bhijayate: even the fallen devotee gets the opportunity to take his birth in the family of a wellsituated
brahmana or in a rich, well-to-do mercantile family. In both these families there is a good
opportunity to revive one's sense of God consciousness automatically because particularly in these
families the worship of Lord Krsna is regularly performed and the child gets the opportunity to imitate the
process of worship called arcana.
The pancaratriki formula for training persons in devotional service is temple worship, whereby the
neophytes get the opportunity to learn devotional service to the Lord. Maharaja Pariksit also used to play
with Krsna dolls in his childhood. In India the children in good families are still given dolls of the Lord
like Rama and Krsna, or sometimes the demigods, so that they may develop the aptitude of service to the
Lord. By the grace of the Lord we were given the same opportunity by our parents, and the beginning of
our life was based on this principle.
