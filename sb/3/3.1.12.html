<h2>Text</h2>
parthams tu devo bhagavan mukundo

<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
parthan--the sons of Prtha (Kunti); tu--but; devah--the Lord; bhagavan--the Personality of Godhead;
mukundah--Sri Krsna, who awards liberation; grhitavan--has taken up; sa--with; ksiti-deva-devah--the
brahmanas and the demigods; aste--is present; sva-puryam--along with His family; yadu-deva-devah--

nrdeva--kings; devah--Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, has accepted the sons of Prtha as His kinsmen, and all the
kings of the world are with Lord Sri Krsna. He is present in His home with all His family members, the
kings and princes of the Yadu dynasty, who have conquered an unlimited number of rulers, and He is
their Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vidura gave Dhrtarastra very good counsel regarding political alliance with the sons of Prtha, the
Pandavas. The first thing he said was that Lord Krsna was intimately related with them as their cousin.
Because Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is worshipable by all brahmanas and
demigods, who are the controllers of the universal affairs. Besides that, Lord Krsna and His family
members, the royal order of the Yadu dynasty, were the conquerors of all kings of the world.
The ksatriyas used to fight the kings of various dominions and kidnap their beautiful princessdaughters,
after conquering their relatives. This system was laudable because the ksatriyas and the
princesses would be married only on the basis of the chivalry of the conquering ksatriya. All the young
princes of the Yadu dynasty married the daughters of other kings in this way, by chivalrous force, and
thus they were conquerors of all the kings of the world. Vidura wanted to impress upon his elder brother
that fighting with the Pandavas was fraught with many dangers because they were supported by Lord
Krsna, who had conquered, even in His childhood, demons like Kamsa and Jarasandha and demigods like
Brahma and Indra. Therefore all universal power was behind the Pandavas.
