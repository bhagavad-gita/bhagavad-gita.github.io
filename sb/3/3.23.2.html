<h2>Text</h2>
visrambhenatma-saucena
gauravena damena ca
susrusaya sauhrdena
vaca madhuraya ca bhoh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
visrambhena--with intimacy; atma-saucena--with purity of mind and body; gauravena--with great
respect; damena--with control of the senses; ca--and; susrusaya--with service; sauhrdena--with love; vaca--
with words; madhuraya--sweet; ca--and; bhoh--O Vidura.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Vidura, Devahuti served her husband with intimacy and great respect, with control of the senses, with
love and with sweet words.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here two words are very significant. Devahuti served her husband in two ways, visrambhena and
gauravena. These are two important processes in serving the husband or the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. Visrambhena means "with intimacy," and gauravena means "with great reverence." The
husband is a very intimate friend; therefore, the wife must render service just like an intimate friend, and
at the same time she must understand that the husband is superior in position, and thus she must offer
him all respect. A man's psychology and woman's psychology are different. As constituted by bodily
frame, a man always wants to be superior to his wife, and a woman, as bodily constituted, is naturally
inferior to her husband. Thus the natural instinct is that the husband wants to post himself as superior to
the wife, and this must be observed. Even if there is some wrong on the part of the husband, the wife
must tolerate it, and thus there will be no misunderstanding between husband and wife. Visrambhena
means "with intimacy," but it must not be familiarity that breeds contempt. According to the Vedic
civilization, a wife cannot call her husband by name. In the present civilization the wife calls her husband
by name, but in Hindu civilization she does not. Thus the inferiority and superiority complexes are
recognized. Damena ca: a wife has to learn to control herself even if there is a misunderstanding.
Sauhrdena vaca madhuraya means always desiring good for the husband and speaking to him with sweet
words. A person becomes agitated by so many material contacts in the outside world; therefore, in his
home life he must be treated by his wife with sweet words.
