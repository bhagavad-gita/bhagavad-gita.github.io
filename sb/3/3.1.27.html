<h2>Translation</h2>
[Please tell me] whether the best friend of the Kurus, our brother-in-law Vasudeva, is doing well. He is
very munificent. He is like a father to his sisters, and he is always pleasing to his wives.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Krsna's father, Vasudeva, had sixteen wives, and one of them, named Pauravi or Rohini, the
mother of Baladeva, was the sister of Vidura. Vasudeva, therefore, was the husband of Vidura's sister, and
thus they were brothers-in-law. Vasudeva's sister Kunti was the wife of Pandu, Vidura's elder brother, and
in that sense also, Vasudeva was brother-in-law to Vidura. Kunti was younger than Vasudeva, and it was
the duty of the elder brother to treat younger sisters as daughters. Whenever anything was needed by
Kunti, it was munificently delivered by Vasudeva, due to his great love for his younger sister. Vasudeva
never dissatisfied his wives, and at the same time he supplied the objects desired by his sister. He had
special attention for Kunti because she became a widow at an early age. While inquiring about Vasudeva's
welfare, Vidura remembered all about him and the family relationship.
