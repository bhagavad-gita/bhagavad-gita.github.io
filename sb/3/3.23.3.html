<h2>Text</h2>
visrjya kamam dambham ca
dvesam lobham agham madam
apramattodyata nityam
tejiyamsam atosayat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
visrjya--giving up; kamam--lust; dambham--pride; ca--and; dvesam--envy; lobham--greed; agham--sinful
activities; madam--vanity; apramatta--sane; udyata--laboring diligently; nityam--always; tejiyamsam--her
very powerful husband; atosayat--she pleased.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Working sanely and diligently, she pleased her very powerful husband, giving up all lust, pride, envy,
greed, sinful activities and vanity.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here are some of the qualities of a great husband's great wife. Kardama Muni is great by spiritual
qualification. Such a husband is called tejiyamsam, most powerful. Although a wife may be equal to her
husband in advancement in spiritual consciousness, she should not be vainly proud. Sometimes it
happens that the wife comes from a very rich family, as did Devahuti, the daughter of Emperor
Svayambhuva Manu. She could have been very proud of her parentage, but that is forbidden. The wife
should not be proud of her parental position. She must always be submissive to the husband and must
give up all vanity. As soon as the wife becomes proud of her parentage, her pride creates great
misunderstanding between the husband and wife, and their nuptial life is ruined. Devahuti was very
careful about that, and therefore it is said here that she gave up pride completely. Devahuti was not
unfaithful. The most sinful activity for a wife is to accept another husband or another lover. Canakya
Pandita has described four kinds of enemies at home. If the father is in debt he is considered to be an
enemy; if the mother has selected another husband in the presence of her grown-up children, she is
considered to be an enemy; if a wife does not live well with her husband but deals very roughly, then she
is an enemy; and if a son is a fool, he is also an enemy. In family life, father, mother, wife and children are
assets, but if the wife or mother accepts another husband in the presence of her husband or son, then,
according to Vedic civilization, she is considered an enemy. A chaste and faithful woman must not
practice adultery--that is a greatly sinful act.
