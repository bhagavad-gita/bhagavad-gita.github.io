<p>

<br>
<h2>Text</h2>
bahir-jata-viragaya
santa-cittaya diyatam
nirmatsaraya sucaye
yasyaham preyasam priyah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bahih--for what is outside; jata-viragaya--to him who has developed detachment; santa-cittaya--whose
mind is peaceful; diyatam--let this be instructed; nirmatsaraya--nonenvious; sucaye--perfectly cleansed;
yasya--of whom; aham--I; preyasam--of all that is very dear; priyah--the most dear.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
This instruction should be imparted by the spiritual master to persons who have taken the Supreme
Personality of Godhead to be more dear than anything, who are not envious of anyone, who are perfectly
cleansed and who have developed detachment for that which is outside the purview of Krsna
consciousness.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the beginning, no one can be elevated to the highest stage of devotional service. Here bhakta means
one who does not hesitate to accept the reformatory processes for becoming a bhakta. In order to become
a devotee of the Lord, one has to accept a spiritual master and inquire from him about how to progress in
devotional service. To serve a devotee, to chant the holy name according to a certain counting method, to
worship the Deity, to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita from a realized person and to live in a
sacred place where devotional service is not disturbed are the first out of sixty-four devotional activities
for making progress in devotional service. One who has accepted these five chief activities is called a
devotee.
One must be prepared to offer the necessary respect and honor to the spiritual master. He should not be
unnecessarily envious of his Godbrothers. Rather, if a Godbrother is more enlightened and advanced in
Krsna consciousness, one should accept him as almost equal to the spiritual master, and one should be
happy to see such Godbrothers advance in Krsna consciousness. A devotee should always be very kind to
the general public in instructing Krsna consciousness because that is the only solution for getting out of
the clutches of maya. That is really humanitarian work, for it is the way to show mercy to other people
who need it very badly. The word susrusabhirataya indicates a person who faithfully engages in serving
the spiritual master. One should give personal service and all kinds of comforts to the spiritual master. A
devotee who does so is also a bona fide candidate for taking this instruction. The word bahir jata-viragaya
means a person who has developed detachment from external and internal material propensities. Not only
is he detached from activities which are not connected to Krsna consciousness, but he should be
internally averse to the material way of life. Such a person must be nonenvious and should think of the
welfare of all living entities, not only of the human beings, but living entities other than human beings.
The word sucaye means one who is cleansed both externally and internally. To become actually cleansed
externally and internally, one should chant the holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna, or Visnu, constantly.
The word diyatam means that knowledge of Krsna consciousness should be offered by the spiritual
master. The spiritual master must not accept a disciple who is not qualified; he should not be professional
and should not accept disciples for monetary gains. The bona fide spiritual master must see the bona fide
qualities of a person whom he is going to initiate. An unworthy person should not be initiated. The
spiritual master should train his disciple in such a way so that in the future only the Supreme Personality
of Godhead will be the dearmost goal of his life.
In these two verses the qualities of a devotee are fully explained. One who has actually developed all the
qualities listed in these verses is already elevated to the post of a devotee. If one has not developed all
these qualities, he still has to fulfill these conditions in order to become a perfect devotee.
