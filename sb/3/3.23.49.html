<h2>Text</h2>
patim sa pravrajisyantam
tadalaksyosati bahih
smayamana viklavena
hrdayena viduyata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
patim--her husband; sa--she; pravrajisyantam--going to leave home; tada--then; alaksya--after seeing;
usati--beautiful; bahih--outwardly; smayamana--smiling; viklavena--agitated; hrdayena--with a heart;

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When she saw her husband about to leave home, she smiled externally, but at heart she was agitated
and distressed.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni finished his household affairs quickly by his mystic power. The building of the castle in
the air, traveling all over the universe with his wife in the company of beautiful girls, and begetting of
children were finished, and now, according to his promise to leave home for his real concern of spiritual
realization after impregnating his wife, he was about to go away. Seeing her husband about to leave,
Devahuti was very disturbed, but to satisfy her husband she was smiling. The example of Kardama Muni
should be understood very clearly; a person whose main concern is Krsna consciousness, even if he is
entrapped in household life, should always be ready to leave household enticement as soon as possible.
