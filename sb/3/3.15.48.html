<h2>Translation</h2>
Persons who are very expert and most intelligent in understanding things as they are engage in hearing
narrations of the auspicious activities and pastimes of the Lord, which are worth chanting and worth
hearing. Such persons do not care even for the highest material benediction, namely liberation, to say
nothing of other less important benedictions like the material happiness of the heavenly kingdom.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The transcendental bliss enjoyed by the devotees of the Lord is completely different from the material
happiness enjoyed by less intelligent persons. The less intelligent persons in the material world are
engaged by the four principles of benediction called dharma, artha, kama and moksa. Generally they
prefer to take to religious life to achieve some material benediction, the purpose of which is to satisfy the
senses. When, by that process, they become confused or frustrated in fulfilling the maximum amount of
sense enjoyment, they try to become one with the Supreme, which is, according to their conception,
mukti, or liberation. There are five kinds of liberation, the least important of which is called sayujya, to
become one with the Supreme. Devotees don't care for such liberation because they are actually
intelligent. Nor are they inclined to accept any of the other four kinds of liberation, namely to live on the
same planet as the Lord, to live with Him side by side as an associate, to have the same opulence, and to
attain the same bodily features. They are concerned only with glorifying the Supreme Lord and His
auspicious activities. Pure devotional service is sravanam kirtanam. Pure devotees, who take
transcendental pleasure in hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord, do not care for any kind of
liberation; even if they are offered the five liberations, they refuse to accept them, as stated in the
Bhagavatam in the Third Canto. Materialistic persons aspire for the sense enjoyment of heavenly pleasure
in the heavenly kingdom, but devotees reject such material pleasure at once. The devotee does not even
care for the post of Indra. A devotee knows that any pleasurable material position is subject to be
annihilated at a certain point. Even if one reaches the post of Indra, Candra, or any other demigod, he
must be dissolved at a certain stage. A devotee is never interested in such temporary pleasure. From Vedic
scriptures it is understood that sometimes even Brahma and Indra fall down, but a devotee in the
transcendental abode of the Lord never falls. This transcendental stage of life, in which one feels
transcendental pleasure in hearing the Lord's pastimes, is also recommended by Lord Caitanya. When
Lord Caitanya was talking with Ramananda Raya, there were varieties of suggestions offered by
Ramananda regarding spiritual realization, but Lord Caitanya rejected all but one--that one should hear
the glories of the Lord in association with pure devotees. That is acceptable for everyone, especially in this
age. One should engage himself in hearing from pure devotees about the activities of the Lord. That is
considered the supreme benediction for mankind.
