TRANSLATION
Maitreya said: When the equilibrium of the combination of the three modes of nature was agitated by
the unseen activity of the living entity, by Maha-Visnu and by the force of time, the total material
elements were produced.
PURPORT
The cause of the material creation is described here very lucidly. The first cause is daiva, or the destiny
of the conditioned soul. The material creation exists for the conditioned soul who wanted to become a
false lord for sense enjoyment. One cannot trace out the history of when the conditioned soul first desired
to lord it over material nature, but in Vedic literature we always find that the material creation is meant
for the sense enjoyment of the conditioned soul. There is a nice verse which says that the sum and
substance of the conditioned soul's sense enjoyment is that as soon as he forgets his primary duty, to
render service to the Lord, he creates an atmosphere of sense enjoyment, which is called maya; that is the
cause of material creation.
Another word used here is durvitarkyena. No one can argue about when and how the conditioned soul
became desirous of sense enjoyment, but the cause is there. Material nature is an atmosphere meant only
for the sense enjoyment of the conditioned soul, and it is created by the Personality of Godhead. It is
mentioned here that in the beginning of the creation the material nature, or prakrti, is agitated by the
Personality of Godhead, Visnu. There are three Visnus mentioned. One is Maha-Visnu, another is
Garbhodakasayi Visnu, and the third is Ksirodakasayi Visnu. The First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam
discusses all these three Visnus, and here also it is confirmed that Visnu is the cause of creation. From
Bhagavad-gita also we learn that prakrti begins to work and is still working under Krsna's, or Visnu's,
glance of superintendence, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unchangeable. One should not
mistakenly think that because the creation emanates from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He has
therefore transformed into this material cosmic manifestation. He exists in His personal form always, but
the cosmic manifestation takes place by His inconceivable potency. The workings of that energy are
difficult to comprehend, but it is understood from Vedic literature that the conditioned soul creates his
own destiny and is offered a particular body by the laws of nature under the superintendence of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who always accompanies him as Paramatma.
