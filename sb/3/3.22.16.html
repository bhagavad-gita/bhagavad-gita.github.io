Let your daughter's desire for marriage, which is recognized in the Vedic scriptures, be fulfilled. Who
would not accept her hand? She is so beautiful that by her bodily luster alone she excels the beauty of her
ornaments.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kardama Muni wanted to marry Devahuti in the recognized manner of marriage prescribed in the
scriptures. As stated in the Vedic scriptures, the first-class process is to call the bridegroom to the home of
the bride and hand her to him in charity with a dowry of necessary ornaments, gold, furniture and other
household paraphernalia. This form of marriage is prevalent among higher-class Hindus even today and is
declared in the sastras to confer great religious merit on the bride's father. To give a daughter in charity to
a suitable son-in-law is considered to be one of the pious activities of a householder. There are eight forms
of marriage mentioned in the scripture Manu-smrti, but only one process of marriage, brahma or rajasika
marriage, is now current. Other kinds of marriage--by love, by exchange of garlands or by kidnapping the
bride--are now forbidden in this Kali age. Formerly, ksatriyas would, at their pleasure, kidnap a princess
from another royal house, and there would he a fight between the ksatriya and the girl's family; then, if
the kidnapper was the winner, the girl would be offered to him for marriage. Even Krsna married Rukmini
by that process, and some of His sons and grandsons also married by kidnapping. Krsna's grandsons
kidnapped Duryodhana's daughter, which caused a fight between the Kuru and Yadu families. Afterward,
an adjustment was made by the elderly members of the Kuru family. Such marriages were current in
bygone ages, but at the present moment they are impossible because the strict principles of ksatriya life
have practically been abolished. Since India has become dependent on foreign countries, the particular
influences of her social orders have been lost; now, according to the scriptures, everyone is a sudra. The
so-called brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas have forgotten their traditional activities, and in the absence of
these activities they are called sudras. It is said in the scriptures, kalau sudra-sambhavah. In the age of
Kali everyone will be like sudras. The traditional social customs are not followed in this age, although
formerly they were followed strictly.
