TRANSLATION
O my Lord, You are the master and leader of all living entities. Under Your direction, all conditioned
souls, as if bound by rope, are constantly engaged in satisfying their desires. Following them, O
embodiment of religion, I also bear oblations for You, who are eternal time.
PURPORT
In the Katha Upanisad it is stated that the Supreme Lord is the leader of all living entities. He is their
sustainer and the awarder of all their necessities and desires. No living entity is independent; all are
dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the Vedic instruction is that one should enjoy
life under the direction of the supreme leader, the Personality of Godhead. Vedic literatures like
Isopanisad direct that since everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should not
encroach upon another's property, but should enjoy one's individual allotment. The best program for
every living entity is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and enjoy material or spiritual life.
A question may be raised: Since Kardama Muni was advanced in spiritual life, why then did he not ask
the Lord for liberation? Why did he want to enjoy material life in spite of his personally seeing and
experiencing the Supreme Lord? The answer is that not everyone is competent to be liberated from
material bondage. It is everyone's duty, therefore, to enjoy according to his present position, but under
the direction of the Lord or the Vedas. The Vedas are considered to be the direct words of the Lord. The
Lord gives us the opportunity to enjoy material life as we want, and at the same time He gives directions
for the modes and processes of abiding by the Vedas so that gradually one may be elevated to liberation
from material bondage. The conditioned souls who have come to the material world to fulfill their desires
to lord it over material nature are bound by the laws of nature. The best course is to abide by the Vedic
rules; that will help one to be gradually elevated to liberation.
Kardama Muni addresses the Lord as suka, which means "the leader of religion." One who is pious
should follow the rules of religion, for such rules are prescribed by the Lord Himself. No one can
manufacture or concoct a religion; "religion" refers to the injunctions or laws of the Lord. In Bhagavadgita
the Lord says that religion means to surrender unto Him. Therefore one should follow the Vedic
regulations and surrender unto the Supreme Lord because that is the ultimate goal of perfection in human
life. One should live a life of piety, follow the religious rules and regulations, marry and live peacefully for
elevation to the higher status of spiritual realization.
