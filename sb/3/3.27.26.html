<h2>Text</h2>
evam vidita-tattvasya
prakrtir mayi manasam
yunjato napakuruta
atmaramasya karhicit
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; vidita-tattvasya--to one who knows the Absolute Truth; prakrtih--material nature; mayi--on
Me; manasam--the mind; yunjatah--fixing; na--not; apakurute--can do harm; atma-aramasya--to one who
rejoices in the self; karhicit--at any time.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The influence of material nature cannot harm an enlightened soul, even though he engages in material
activities, because he knows the truth of the Absolute, and his mind is fixed on the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Kapila says that mayi manasam, a devotee whose mind is always fixed upon the lotus feet of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is called atmarama or vidita-tattva. Atmarama means "one who rejoices
in the self," or "one who enjoys in the spiritual atmosphere." Atma, in the material sense, means the body
or the mind, but when referring to one whose mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord,
atmarama means "one who is fixed in spiritual activities in relationship with the Supreme Soul." The
Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead, and the individual soul is the living entity. When they
engage in reciprocation of service and benediction, the living entity is said to be in the atmarama position.
This atmarama position can be attained by one who knows the truth as it is. The truth is that the Supreme
Personality of Godhead is the enjoyer and that the living entities are meant for His service and enjoyment.
One who knows this truth, and who tries to engage all resources in the service of the Lord, escapes all
material reactions and influences of the modes of material nature.
An example may be cited in this connection. Just as a materialist engages in constructing a big
skyscraper, a devotee engages in constructing a big temple for Visnu. Superficially, the skyscraper
constructor and temple constructor are on the same level, for both are collecting wood, stone, iron and
other building materials. But the person who constructs a skyscraper is a materialist, and the person who
constructs a temple of Visnu is atmarama. The materialist tries to satisfy himself in relation to his body by
constructing a skyscraper, but the devotee tries to satisfy the Superself, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, by constructing the temple. Although both are engaged in the association of material activities,
the devotee is liberated, and the materialist is conditioned. This is because the devotee, who is
constructing the temple, has fixed his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the
nondevotee, who is constructing the skyscraper, has his mind fixed in sense gratification. If, while
performing any activity, even in material existence, one's mind is fixed upon the lotus feet of the
Personality of Godhead, one will not be entangled or conditioned. The worker in devotional service, in
full Krsna consciousness, is always independent of the influence of material nature.
