TRANSLATION
In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge one
gradually becomes advanced on the path of liberation, and thereafter he is freed, and his attraction
becomes fixed. Then real devotion and devotional service begin.
PURPORT
The process of advancing in Krsna consciousness and devotional service is described here. The first
point is that one must seek the association of persons who are Krsna conscious and who engage in
devotional service. Without such association one cannot make advancement. Simply by theoretical
knowledge or study one cannot make any appreciable advancement. One must give up the association of
materialistic persons and seek the association of devotees because without the association of devotees one
cannot understand the activities of the Lord. Generally, people are convinced of the impersonal feature of
the Absolute Truth. Because they do not associate with devotees, they cannot understand that the
Absolute Truth can be a person and have personal activities. This is a very difficult subject matter, and
unless one has personal understanding of the Absolute Truth, there is no meaning to devotion. Service or
devotion cannot be offered to anything impersonal. Service must be offered to a person. Nondevotees
cannot appreciate Krsna consciousness by reading the Srimad-Bhagavatam or any other Vedic literature
wherein the activities of the Lord are described; they think that these activities are fictional, manufactured
stories because spiritual life is not explained to them in the proper mood. To understand the personal
activities of the Lord, one has to seek the association of devotees, and by such association, when one
contemplates and tries to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, the path to liberation is
open, and he is freed. One who has firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes fixed, and
his attraction for association with the Lord and the devotees increases. Association with devotees means
association with the Lord. The devotee who makes this association develops the consciousness for
rendering service to the Lord, and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional
service, he gradually becomes perfect.
