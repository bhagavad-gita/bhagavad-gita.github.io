<h2>Translation</h2>
When the doormen of Vaikunthaloka, who were certainly devotees of the Lord, found that they were
going to be cursed by the brahmanas, they at once became very much afraid and fell down at the feet of
the brahmanas in great anxiety, for a brahmana's curse cannot be counteracted by any kind of weapon.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Although, by chance, the doormen committed a mistake by checking the brahmanas from entering the
gate of Vaikuntha, they were at once aware of the gravity of the curse. There are many kinds of offenses,
but the greatest offense is to offend a devotee of the Lord. Because the doormen were also devotees of the
Lord, they were able to understand their mistake and were terrified when the four Kumaras were ready to
curse them.
