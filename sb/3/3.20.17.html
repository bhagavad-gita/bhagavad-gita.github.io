<h2>Text</h2>
so 'nuvisto bhagavata
yah sete salilasaye
loka-samstham yatha purvam
nirmame samsthaya svaya
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--Lord Brahma; anuvistah--was entered; bhagavata--by the Lord; yah--who; sete--sleeps; salila-asaye--
on the Garbhodaka Ocean; loka-samstham--the universe; yatha purvam--as previously; nirmame--created;
samsthaya--by intelligence; svaya--his own.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is lying on the Garbhodaka Ocean entered the heart of
Brahma, Brahma brought his intelligence to bear, and with the intelligence invoked he began to create the
universe as it was before.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At a certain time, the Personality of Godhead, Karanodakasayi Visnu, lies in the Karana Ocean and
produces many thousands of universes from His breathing; then He enters again into each and every
universe as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and fills up half of each universe with His own perspiration. The other
half of the universe remains vacant, and that vacant region is called outer space. Then the lotus flower
sprouts from His abdomen and produces the first living creature, Brahma. Then again, as Ksirodakasayi
Visnu, the Lord enters into the heart of every living entity, including Brahma. This is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita, Fifteenth Chapter. The Lord says, "I am seated in everyone's heart, and by Me are
remembrance and forgetfulness made possible." As the witness of the activities of the individual entities,
the Lord gives each one remembrance and intelligence to act according to his desire at the time he was
annihilated in his last birth in the last millennium. This intelligence is invoked according to one's own
capacity, or by the law of karma.
Brahma was the first living entity, and he was empowered by the Supreme Lord to act in charge of the
mode of passion; therefore, he was given the required intelligence, which is so powerful and extensive
that he is almost independent of the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Just as a highly
posted manager is almost as independent as the owner of a firm, Brahma is described here as independent
because, as the Lord's representative to control the universe, he is almost as powerful and independent as
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord, as the Supersoul within Brahma, gave him the intelligence
to create. The creative power, therefore, of every living entity is not his own; it is by the grace of the Lord
that one can create. There are many scientists and great workers in this material world who have
wonderful creative force, but they act and create only according to the direction of the Supreme Lord. A
scientist may create many wonderful inventions by the direction of the Lord, but it is not possible for him
to overcome the stringent laws of material nature by his intelligence, nor is it possible to acquire such
intelligence from the Lord, for the Lord's supremacy would then be hampered. It is stated in this verse
that Brahma created the universe as it was before. This means that he created everything by the same
name and form as in the previous cosmic manifestation.
