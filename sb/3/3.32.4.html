<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
As the Supreme Personality of Godhead, You have taken birth from my abdomen. O my Lord, how is
that possible for the supreme one, who has in His belly all the cosmic manifestation? The answer is that it
is possible, for at the end of the millennium You lie down on a leaf of a banyan tree, and just like a small
baby, You lick the toe of Your lotus foot.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
At the time of dissolution the Lord sometimes appears as a small baby lying on a leaf of a banyan tree,
floating on the devastating water. Therefore Devahuti suggests, "Your lying down within the abdomen of a
common woman like me is not so astonishing. You can lie down on the leaf of a banyan tree and float on
the water of devastation as a small baby. It is not very wonderful, therefore, that You can lie down in the
abdomen of my body. You teach us that those who are very fond of children within this material world
and who therefore enter into marriage to enjoy family life with children can also have the Supreme
Personality of Godhead as their child, and the most wonderful thing is that the Lord Himself licks His
toe."
Since all the great sages and devotees apply all energy and all activities in the service of the lotus feet of
the Lord, there must be some transcendental pleasure in the toes of His lotus feet. The Lord licks His toe
to taste the nectar for which the devotees always aspire. Sometimes the Supreme Personality of Godhead
Himself wonders how much transcendental pleasure is within Himself, and in order to taste His own
potency, He sometimes takes the position of tasting Himself. Lord Caitanya is Krsna Himself, but He
appears as a devotee to taste the sweetness of the transcendental mellow in Himself which is tasted by
Srimati Radharani, the greatest of all devotees.
