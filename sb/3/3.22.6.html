<h2>Translation</h2>
It is my good fortune that I have been able to see you, for you cannot easily be seen by persons who
have not subdued the mind or controlled the senses. I am all the more fortunate to have touched with my
head the blessed dust of your feet.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The perfection of transcendental life can be achieved simply by touching the holy dust of the lotus feet
of a holy man. In the Bhagavatam it is said, mahat-pada-rajo-'bhisekam, which means to be blessed by the
holy dust of the lotus feet of a mahat, a great devotee. As stated in Bhagavad-gita, mahatmanas tu: those
who are great souls are under the spell of spiritual energy, and their symptom is that they fully engage in
Krsna consciousness for the service of the Lord. Therefore they are called mahat. Unless one is fortunate
enough to have the dust of the lotus feet of a mahatma on one's head, there is no possibility of perfection
in spiritual life.
The parampara system of disciplic succession is very important as a means of spiritual success. One
becomes a mahat by the grace of his mahat spiritual master. If one takes shelter of the lotus feet of a great
soul, there is every possibility of one's also becoming a great soul. When Maharaja Rahugana asked Jada
Bharata about his wonderful achievement of spiritual success, he replied to the King that spiritual success
is not possible simply by following the rituals of religion or simply by converting oneself into a sannyasi
or offering sacrifices as recommended in the scriptures. These methods are undoubtedly helpful for
spiritual realization, but the real effect is brought about by the grace of a mahatma. In Visvanatha
Cakravarti Thakura's eight stanzas of prayer to the spiritual master, it is clearly stated that simply by
satisfying the spiritual master one can achieve the supreme success in life, and in spite of executing all
ritualistic performances, if one cannot satisfy the spiritual master, one has no access to spiritual
perfection. Here the word akrtatmanam is very significant. Atma means "body," "soul," or "mind," and
akrtatma means the common man, who cannot control the senses or the mind. Because the common man
is unable to control the senses and the mind, it is his duty to seek the shelter of a great soul or a great
devotee of the Lord and just try to please him. That will make his life perfect. A common man cannot rise
to the topmost stage of spiritual perfection simply by following the rituals and religious principles. He has
to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master and work under his direction faithfully and sincerely; then
he becomes perfect, without a doubt.
