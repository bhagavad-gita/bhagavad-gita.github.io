<h2>Translation</h2>
Now, being sanctioned by Me, go as you desire, surrendering all your activities to Me. Conquering
insurmountable death, worship Me for eternal life.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The purpose of Sankhya philosophy is stated herein. If anyone wants real, eternal life, he has to engage
himself in devotional service, or Krsna consciousness. To become free from birth and death is not an easy
task. Birth and death are natural to this material body. Sudurjayam means "very, very difficult to
overcome." The modern so-called scientists do not have sufficient means to understand the process of
victory over birth and death. Therefore, they set aside the question of birth and death; they do not
consider it. They simply engage in the problems of the material body, which is transient and sure to end.
Actually, human life is meant for conquering the insurmountable process of birth and death. That can
be done as stated here. Mam bhaja: one must engage in the devotional service of the Lord. In Bhagavadgita
also the Lord says, man-mana bhava mad-bhaktah: "Just become My devotee. Just worship Me." But
foolish so-called scholars say that it is not Krsna whom we must worship and to whom we must
surrender; it is something else. Without Krsna's mercy, therefore, no one can understand the Sankhya
philosophy or any philosophy which is especially meant for liberation. Vedic knowledge confirms that
one becomes entangled in this material life because of ignorance and that one can become free from
material embarrassment by becoming situated in factual knowledge. Sankhya means that factual
knowledge by which one can get out of the material entanglement.
