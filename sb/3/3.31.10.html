<h2>Text</h2>
evam paretya bhagavantam anupravista
ye yogino jita-marun-manaso viragah
tenaiva sakam amrtam purusam puranam
brahma pradhanam upayanty agatabhimanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
evam--thus; paretya--having gone a long distance; bhagavantam--Lord Brahma; anupravistah--entered;
ye--those who; yoginah--yogis; jita--controlled; marut--the breathing; manasah--the mind; viragah--
detached; tena--with Lord Brahma; eva--indeed; sakam--together; amrtam--the embodiment of bliss;
purusam--unto the personality of Godhead; puranam--the oldest; brahma pradhanam--the Supreme
Brahman; upayanti--they go; agata--not gone; abhimanah--whose false ego.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The yogis who become detached from the material world by practice of breathing exercises and control
of the mind reach the planet of Brahma, which is far, far away. After giving up their bodies, they enter into
the body of Lord Brahma, and therefore when Brahma is liberated and goes to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who is the Supreme Brahman, such yogis can also enter into the kingdom of God.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
By perfecting their yogic practice, yogis can reach the highest planet, Brahmaloka, or Satyaloka, and
after giving up their material bodies, they can enter into the body of Lord Brahma. Because they are not
directly devotees of the Lord, they cannot get liberation directly. They have to wait until Brahma is
liberated, and only then, along with Brahma, are they also liberated. It is clear that as long as a living
entity is a worshiper of a particular demigod, his consciousness is absorbed in thoughts of that demigod,
and therefore he cannot get direct liberation, or entrance into the kingdom of God, nor can he merge into
the impersonal effulgence of the Supreme personality of Godhead. Such yogis or demigod worshipers are
subjected to the chance of taking birth again when there is again creation.
