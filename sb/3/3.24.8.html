TRANSLATION
Kardama Muni continued: What is the use of enjoyments other than the Lord's grace? All material
achievements are subject to be annihilated simply by a movement of the eyebrows of Lord Visnu, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. By your principles of devotion to your husband, you have achieved and
can enjoy transcendental gifts very rarely obtained by persons proud of aristocracy and material
possessions.
PURPORT
Lord Caitanya recommended that the greatest achievement of human life is to achieve the grace of the
Lord, love of God. He said, prema pumartho mahan: to achieve love of Godhead is the highest perfection
of life. The same perfection is recommended by Kardama Muni to his wife. His wife belonged to a very
aristocratic royal family. Generally, those who are very materialistic or who possess material wealth and
prosperity are unable to appreciate the value of transcendental love of God. Although Devahuti was a
princess coming from a very great royal family, fortunately she was under the supervision of her great
husband, Kardama Muni, who offered her the best gift which can be bestowed in human life--the grace of
the Lord, or love of God. This grace of the Lord was achieved by Devahuti by the good will and
satisfaction of her husband. She served her husband, who was a great devotee and saintly person, with
great sincerity, love, affection and service, and Kardama Muni was satisfied. He willingly gave love of God,
and he recommended that she accept it and enjoy it because he had already achieved it.
Love of God is not an ordinary commodity. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was worshiped by Rupa Gosvami
because He distributed love of God, krsna-prema, to everyone. Rupa Gosvami praised Him as mahavadanya,
a greatly munificent personality, because He was freely distributing to everyone love of
Godhead, which is achieved by wise men only after many, many births. Krsna-prema, Krsna
consciousness, is the highest gift which can be bestowed on anyone whom we presume to love.
One word used in this verse, nija-dharma-dohan, is very significant. Devahuti, as the wife of Kardama
Muni, achieved an invaluable gift from her husband because she was very faithful to him. For a woman
the first principle of religion is to be faithful to her husband. If, fortunately, the husband is a great
personality, then the combination is perfect, and the lives of both the wife and the husband are at once
fulfilled.
