<h2>Text</h2>
na lolupayopadisen
na grharudha-cetase
nabhaktaya ca me jatu
na mad-bhakta-dvisam api
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; lolupaya--to the greedy; upadiset--one should instruct; na--not; grha-arudha-cetase--to one who
is too attached to family life; na--not; abhaktaya--to the nondevotee; ca--and; me--of Me; jatu--ever; na--
not; mat--My; bhakta--devotees; dvisam--to those who are envious of; api--also.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
It is not to be instructed to persons who are too greedy and too attached to family life, nor to persons
who are nondevotees and who are envious of the devotees and of the Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Persons who are always planning to do harm to other living entities are not eligible to understand Krsna
consciousness and cannot enter into the realm of transcendental loving service to the Lord. Also, there are
so-called disciples who become submissive to a spiritual master most artificially, with an ulterior motive.
They also cannot understand what Krsna consciousness or devotional service is. Persons who, due to
being initiated by another sect of religious faith, do not find devotional service as the common platform
for approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, also cannot understand Krsna consciousness. We
have experience that some students come to join us, but because of being biased in some particular type
of faith, they leave our camp and become lost in the wilderness. Actually, Krsna consciousness is not a
sectarian religious faith; it is a teaching process for understanding the Supreme Lord and our relationship
with Him. Anyone can join this movement without prejudice, but unfortunately there are persons who
feel differently. It is better, therefore, not to instruct the science of Krsna consciousness to such persons.
Generally, materialistic persons are after some name, fame and material gain, so if someone takes to
Krsna consciousness for these reasons, he will never be able to understand this philosophy. Such persons
take to religious principles as a social decoration. They admit themselves into some cultural institution for
the sake of name only, especially in this age. Such persons also cannot understand the philosophy of
Krsna consciousness. Even if one is not greedy for material possessions but is too attached to family life,
he also cannot understand Krsna consciousness. Superficially, such persons are not very greedy for
material possessions, but they are too attached to wife, children and family improvement. When a person
is not contaminated by the above-mentioned faults yet at the ultimate issue is not interested in the service
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or if he is a nondevotee, he also cannot understand the
philosophy of Krsna consciousness.
