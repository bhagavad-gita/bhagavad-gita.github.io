atho vibhutim mama mayavinas tam
aisvaryam astangam anupravrttam
sriyam bhagavatim vasprhayanti bhadram
parasya me te 'snuvate tu loke
SYNONYMS
atho--then; vibhutim--opulence; mama--of Me; mayavinah--of the Lord of maya; tam--that; aisvaryam--
mystic perfection; asta-angam--consisting of eight parts; anupravrttam--following; sriyam--splendor;
bhagavatim--of the kingdom of God; va--or; asprhayanti--they do not desire; bhadram--blissful; parasya--
of the Supreme Lord; me--of Me; te--those devotees; asnuvate--enjoy; tu--but; loke--in this life.
TRANSLATION
Thus because he is completely absorbed in thought of Me, the devotee does not desire even the highest
benediction obtainable in the upper planetary systems, including Satyaloka. He does not desire the eight
material perfections obtained from mystic yoga, nor does he desire to be elevated to the kingdom of God.
Yet even without desiring them, the devotee enjoys, even in this life, all the offered benedictions.
PURPORT
The vibhuti, or opulences, offered by maya are of many varieties. We have experience of different
varieties of material enjoyment even on this planet, but if one is able to promote himself to higher planets
like Candraloka, the sun or, still higher, Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, or even ultimately the
highest planet, which is inhabited by Brahma and is called Satyaloka, there are immense possibilities for
material enjoyment. For example, the duration of life on higher planets is far, far greater than on this
planet. It is said that on the moon the duration of life is such that our six months are equal to one day. We
cannot even imagine the duration of life on the highest planet. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that Brahma's
twelve hours are inconceivable even to our mathematicians. These are all descriptions of the external
energy of the Lord, or maya. Besides these, there are other opulences which the yogis can achieve by their
mystic power. They are also material. A devotee does not aspire for all these material pleasures, although
they are available to him simply by wishing. By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can achieve wonderful
success simply by willing, but a real devotee does not like that. Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu has taught
that one should not desire material opulence or material reputation, nor should one try to enjoy material
beauty; one should simply aspire to be absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord, even if one does not
get liberation but has to continue the process of birth and death unlimitedly. Actually, however, to one
who engages in Krsna consciousness, liberation is already guaranteed. Devotees enjoy all the benefits of
the higher planets and the Vaikuntha planets also. It is especially mentioned here, bhagavatim bhadram.
In the Vaikuntha planets everything is eternally peaceful, yet a pure devotee does not even aspire to be
promoted there. But still he gets that advantage; he enjoys all the facilities of the material and spiritual
worlds, even during the present life-span.
