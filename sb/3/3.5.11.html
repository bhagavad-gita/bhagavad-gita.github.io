<h2>Translation</h2>
Who in human society can be satisfied without hearing sufficient talk of the Lord, whose lotus feet are
the sum total of all places of pilgrimage and who is worshiped by great sages and devotees? Such topics
can cut off one's bondage to family affection simply by entering the holes of one's ears.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Krsna-katha is so powerful that simply by entering into a person's ear it can at once give deliverance
from the bondage of family affection. Family affection is an illusory manifestation of the external energy,
and it is the only impetus for all mundane activities. As long as there is mundane activity and the mind is
absorbed in such engagement, one has to undergo the repetition of birth and death in the current material
nescience. People are most influenced by the mode of ignorance, and some are influenced by the
passionate mode of material nature, and under the spell of these two modes a living being is actuated by
the material conception of life. The mundane qualities do not allow a living entity to understand his real
position. The qualities of both ignorance and passion strongly bind one to the illusory bodily conception
of the self. The best among the fools who are thus deluded are those who engage in altruistic activities
under the spell of the material mode of passion. Bhagavad-gita, which is direct krsna-katha, gives
humanity the elementary lesson that the body is perishable and that the consciousness which is spread
throughout the body is imperishable. The conscious being, the imperishable self, is eternally existent and
cannot be killed under any circumstances, even after the dissolution of the body. Anyone who
misunderstands this perishable body to be the self and who works for it in the name of sociology, politics,
philanthropy, altruism, nationalism or internationalism, under the false plea of the bodily conception of
life, is certainly a fool and does not know the implications of reality and unreality. Some of them are
above the modes of ignorance and passion and are situated in the mode of goodness, but mundane
goodness is always contaminated by tinges of ignorance and passion. Mundane goodness can enlighten
one that the body and the self are different, and one in goodness is concerned with the self and not the
body. But due to being contaminated, those in mundane goodness cannot understand the real nature of
the self as a person. Their impersonal conception of the self as distinct from the body keeps them in the
mode of goodness within material nature, and unless they are attracted by krsna-katha, they will never be
liberated from the bondage of material existence. Krsna-katha is the only remedy for all people of the
world because it can situate one in pure consciousness of the self and liberate one from material bondage.
To preach krsna-katha all over the world, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, is the greatest missionary
activity, and all sensible men and women of the world may join in this great movement started by Lord
Caitanya.
