<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavan anugav aha
yatam ma bhaistam astu sam
brahma-tejah samartho 'pi
hantum necche matam tu me
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; anugau--to His two attendants; aha--said; yatam--
depart from this place; ma--let there not be; bhaistam--fear; astu--let there be; sam--happiness; brahma--of
a brahmana; tejah--the curse; samarthah--being able; api--even; hantum--to nullify; na icche--do not
desire; matam--approved; tu--on the contrary; me--by Me.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord then said to His attendants, Jaya and Vijaya: Depart this place, but fear not. All glories unto
you. Though I am capable of nullifying the brahmanas' curse, I would not do so. On the contrary, it has
My approval.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As explained in connection with text 26, all the incidents that took place had the approval of the Lord.
Ordinarily, there is no possibility that the four sages could be so angry with the doorkeepers, nor could
the Supreme Lord neglect His two doorkeepers, nor can one come back from Vaikuntha after once taking
birth there. All these incidents, therefore, were designed by the Lord Himself for the sake of His pastimes
in the material world. Thus He plainly says that it was done with His approval. Otherwise, it would have
been impossible for inhabitants of Vaikuntha to come back to this material world simply because of a
brahminical curse. The Lord especially blesses the so-called culprits: "All glories unto you." A devotee,
once accepted by the Lord, can never fall down. That is the conclusion of this incident.
