<h2>Text</h2>
neha yat karma dharmaya
na viragaya kalpate
na tirtha-pada-sevayai
jivann api mrto hi sah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
na--not; iha--here; yat--which; karma--work; dharmaya--for perfection of religious life; na--not;
viragaya--for detachment; kalpate--leads; na--not; tirtha-pada--of the Lord's lotus feet; sevayai--to
devotional service; jivan--living; api--although; mrtah--dead; hi--indeed; sah--he.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Anyone whose work is not meant to elevate him to religious life, anyone whose religious ritualistic
performances do not raise him to renunciation, and anyone situated in renunciation that does not lead
him to devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, must be considered dead, although he
is breathing.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Devahuti's statement is that since she was attached to living with her husband for sense gratification,
which does not lead to liberation from material entanglement, her life was simply a waste of time. Any
work one performs that does not lead to the state of religious life is useless activity. Everyone is by nature
inclined to some sort of work, and when that work leads one to religious life and religious life leads one to
renunciation and renunciation leads one to devotional service, one attains the perfection of work. As
stated in Bhagavad-gita, any work that does not lead ultimately to the standard of devotional service is a
cause of bondage in the material world. Yajnarthat karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah. Unless
one is gradually elevated to the position of devotional service, beginning from his natural activity, he is to
be considered a dead body. Work which does not lead one to the understanding of Krsna consciousness is
considered useless.
