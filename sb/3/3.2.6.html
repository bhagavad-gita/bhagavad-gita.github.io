<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The great devotee Uddhava soon came back from the abode of the Lord to the human plane, and wiping
his eyes, he awakened his reminiscence of the past and spoke to Vidura in a pleasing mood.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When Uddhava was fully absorbed in the transcendental ecstasy of love of Cod, he actually forgot all
about the external world. The pure devotee lives constantly in the abode of the Supreme Lord, even in the
present body, which apparently belongs to this world. The pure devotee is not exactly on the bodily plane,
since he is absorbed in the transcendental thought of the Supreme. When Uddhava wanted to speak to
Vidura, he came down from the abode of the Lord, Dvaraka, to the material plane of human beings. Even
though a pure devotee is present on this mortal planet, he is here in relation to the Lord for engagement
in transcendental loving service, and not for any material cause. A living entity can live either on the
material plane or in the transcendental abode of the Lord, in accordance with his existential condition.
The conditional changes of the living entity are explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta in the instructions
given to Srila Rupa Gosvami by Lord Sri Caitanya: "The living entities all over the universes are enjoying
the effects of the respective fruitive results of their own work, life after life. Out of all of them, some may
be influenced by the association of pure devotees and thus get the chance to execute devotional service by
attainment of taste. This taste is the seed of devotional service, and one who is fortunate enough to have
received such a seed is advised to sow it in the core of his heart. As one cultivates a seed by pouring water
to fructify it, the seed of devotional service sown in the heart of the devotee may be cultured by pouring
water in the form of hearing and chanting of the holy name and pastimes of the Lord. The creeper of
devotional service, so nourished, gradually grows, and the devotee, acting as a gardener, goes on pouring
the water of constant hearing and chanting. The creeper of devotional service gradually grows so high that
it passes through the entire material universe and enters into the spiritual sky, growing still higher and
higher until it reaches the planet Goloka Vrndavana. The devotee-gardener is in touch with the abode of
the Lord even from the material plane by dint of performing devotional service to the Lord simply by
hearing and chanting. As a creeper takes shelter of another, stronger tree, similarly the creeper of
devotional service, nourished by the devotee, takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus becomes
fixed. When the creeper is fixed, then the fruit of the creeper comes into existence, and the gardener who
nourished it is able to enjoy this fruit of love, and his life becomes successful." That Uddhava attained this
stage is evident from his dealings. He could simultaneously reach the supreme planet and still appear in
this world.
