TRANSLATION
O Vidura, who can estimate or measure the transcendental time, work and potency of the gigantic form
manifested by the internal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?
PURPORT
The froggish philosophers may go on with their mental speculations on the subject matter of the virat,
the gigantic form exhibited by the yogamaya internal potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but
factually no one can measure such a vast exhibition. In Bhagavad-gita (11.16), Arjuna, the recognized
devotee of the Lord, says:
aneka-bahudara-vaktra-netram
pasyami tvam sarvato 'nanta-rupam
nantam na madhyam na punas tavadim
pasyami visvesvara visva-rupa
"O my Lord, O gigantic visva-rupa form, O master of the universe, I see innumerable hands, bodies,
mouths and eyes in all directions, and they are all unlimited. I cannot find the end of this manifestation,
nor do I see the middle, nor the beginning."
Bhagavad-gita was specifically spoken to Arjuna, and the visva-rupa was exhibited before him at his
request. He was awarded the specific eyes to see this visva-rupa, yet although he was able to see the Lord's
innumerable hands and mouths, he was unable to see Him completely. Since Arjuna was unable to
estimate the length and breadth of the potency of the Lord, who else would be able to do so? One may
only indulge in miscalculation like the frog-philosopher. The frog-philosopher wanted to estimate the
length and breadth of the Pacific Ocean by his experience of a well three cubic feet large, and thus he
began to puff himself up to become as big as the Pacific Ocean, but at last he burst and died by this
process. This story is applicable to the mental philosophers who, under the illusion of the Lord's external
energy, indulge in estimating the length and breadth of the Supreme Lord. The best path is to become a
cool-headed, submissive devotee of the Lord, try to hear about the Lord from the bona fide spiritual
master, and thus serve the Lord in transcendental loving service, as suggested in the previous verse.
