maitreyah--the sage Maitreya; uvaca--said; nisamya--upon hearing; atma-bhuva--by Brahma; gitam--
explanation; karanam--the cause; sankaya--from fear; ujjhitah--freed; tatah--then; sarve--all; nyavartanta--
returned; tri-divaya--to the heavenly planets; diva-okasah--the demigods (who inhabit the higher planets).
TRANSLATION
Sri Maitreya said: The demigods, the inhabitants of the higher planets, were freed from all fear upon
hearing the cause of the darkness explained by Brahma, who was born from Visnu. Thus they all returned
to their respective planets.
PURPORT
The demigods, who are denizens of higher planets, are also very much afraid of incidents such as the
universe's becoming dark, and so they consulted Brahma. This indicates that the quality of fear exists for
every living entity in the material world. The four principal activities of material existence are eating,
sleeping, fearing and mating. The fear element exists also in the demigods. On every planet, even in the
higher planetary systems, including the moon and the sun, as well as on this earth, the same principles of
animal life exist. Otherwise, why are the demigods also afraid of the darkness? The difference between the
demigods and ordinary human beings is that the demigods approach authority, whereas the inhabitants of
this earth defy authority. If people would only approach the authority, then every adverse condition in
this universe could be rectified. Arjuna was also disturbed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, but he
approached the authority, Krsna, and his problem was solved. The conclusive instruction of this incident
is that we may be disturbed by some material condition, but if we approach the authority who can
actually explain the matter, then our problem is solved. The demigods approached Brahma for the
meaning of the disturbance, and after hearing from him they were satisfied and returned home peacefully.
