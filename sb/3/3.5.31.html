<p>

<p></p>
<h2>Text</h2>
taijasanindriyany eva
jnana-karma-mayani ca
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
taijasani--the mode of passion; indriyani--the senses; eva--certainly; jnana--knowledge, philosophical
speculations; karma--fruitive activities; mayani--predominating; ca--also.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The senses are certainly products of the mode of passion in false ego, and therefore philosophical
speculative knowledge and fruitive activities are predominantly products of the mode of passion.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The chief function of the false ego is godlessness. When a person forgets his constitutional position as
an eternally subordinate part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and wants to be happy
independently, he functions mainly in two ways. He first attempts to act fruitively for personal gain or
sense gratification, and after attempting such fruitive activities for a considerable time, when he is
frustrated he becomes a philosophical speculator and thinks himself to be on the same level as God. This
false idea of becoming one with the Lord is the last snare of the illusory energy, which traps a living entity
into the bondage of forgetfulness under the spell of false ego.
The best means of liberation from the clutches of false ego is to give up the habit of philosophical
speculation regarding the Absolute Truth. One should know definitely that the Absolute Truth is never
realized by the philosophical speculations of the imperfect egoistic person. The Absolute Truth, or the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, is realized by hearing about Him in all submission and love from a bona
fide authority who is a representative of the twelve great authorities mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
By such an attempt only can one conquer the illusory energy of the Lord, although for others she is
unsurpassable, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.14).
