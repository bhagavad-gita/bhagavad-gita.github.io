<h2>Translation</h2>
The Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always the benefactor of the surrendered souls. His
activities are always enacted through His internal potency, Rama, or the goddess of fortune. I pray only to
engage in His service in the creation of the material world, and I pray that I not be materially affected by
my works, for thus I may be able to give up the false prestige of being the creator.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the matter of material creation, maintenance and destruction, there are three incarnations of the
material modes of nature--Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. But the Lord's incarnation as Visnu, in His
internal potency, is the supreme energy for the total activities. Brahma, who is only an assistant in the
modes of creation, wanted to remain in his actual position as an instrument of the Lord instead of
becoming puffed up by the false prestige of thinking himself the creator. That is the way of becoming dear
to the Supreme Lord and receiving His benediction. Foolish men want to take credit for all creations made
by them, but intelligent persons know very well that not a blade of grass can move without the will of the
Lord; thus all the credit for wonderful creations must go to Him. By spiritual consciousness only can one
be free from the contamination of material affection and receive the benedictions offered by the Lord.
