<h2>Text</h2>
ya udyatam anadrtya
kinasam abhiyacate
ksiyate tad-yasah sphitam
manas cavajnaya hatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yah--who; udyatam--an offering; anadrtya--rejecting; kinasam--from a miser; abhiyacate--begs; ksiyate--
is lost; tat--his; yasah--reputation; sphitam--widespread; manah--honor; ca--and; avajnaya--by neglectful
behavior; hatah--destroyed.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One who rejects an offering that comes of its own accord but later begs a boon from a miser thus loses
his widespread reputation, and his pride is humbled by the neglectful behavior of others.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The general procedure of Vedic marriage is that a father offers his daughter to a suitable boy. That is a
very respectable marriage. A boy should not go to the girl's father and ask for the hand of his daughter in
marriage. That is considered to be humbling one's respectable position. Svayambhuva Manu wanted to
convince Kardama Muni, since he knew that the sage wanted to marry a suitable girl: "I am offering just
such a suitable wife. Do not reject the offer, or else, because you are in need of a wife, you will have to ask
for such a wife from someone else, who may not behave with you so well. In that case your position will
be humbled."
Another feature of this incident is that Svayambhuva Manu was the emperor, but he went to offer his
qualified daughter to a poor brahmana. Kardama Muni had no worldly possessions--he was a hermit
living in the forest--but he was advanced in culture. Therefore, in offering one's daughter to a person, the
culture and quality are counted as prominent, not wealth or any other material consideration.
