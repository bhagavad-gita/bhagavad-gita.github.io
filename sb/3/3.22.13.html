TRANSLATION
The great sage Kardama said: O supreme worshipful Lord, my power of sight is now fulfilled, having
attained the greatest perfection of the sight of You, who are the reservoir of all existences. Through many
successive births of deep meditation, advanced yogis aspire to see Your transcendental form.
PURPORT
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described here as the reservoir of all goodness and all pleasure.
Unless one is situated in the mode of goodness, there is no real pleasure. When, therefore, one's body,
mind and activities are situated in the service of the Lord, one is on the highest perfectional stage of
goodness. Kardama Muni says, "Your Lordship is the reservoir of all that can be understood by the
nomenclature of goodness, and by experiencing You face to face, eye to eye, the perfection of sight has
now been attained." These statements are the pure devotional situation; for a devotee, the perfection of
the senses is to engage in the service of the Lord. The sense of sight, when engaged in seeing the beauty of
the Lord, is perfected; the power to hear, when engaged in hearing the glories of the Lord, is perfected;
the power to taste, when one enjoys by eating prasada, is perfected. When all the senses engage in
relationship with the Personality of Godhead, one's perfection is technically called bhakti-yoga, which
entails detaching the senses from material indulgence and attaching them to the service of the Lord. When
one is freed from all designated conditional life and fully engages in the service of the Lord, one's service
is called bhakti-yoga. Kardama Muni admits that seeing the Lord personally in bhakti-yoga is the
perfection of sight. The exalted perfection of seeing the Lord is not exaggerated by Kardama Muni. He
gives evidence that those who are actually elevated in yoga aspire in life after life to see this form of the
Personality of Godhead. He was not a fictitious yogi. Those who are actually on the advanced path aspire
only to see the eternal form of the Lord.
