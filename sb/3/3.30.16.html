<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
No one other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the localized Paramatma, the partial
representation of the Lord, is directing all inanimate and animate objects. He is present in the three phases
of time--past, present and future. Therefore, the conditioned soul is engaged in different activities by His
direction, and in order to get free from the threefold miseries of this conditional life, we have to surrender
unto Him only.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a conditioned soul is seriously anxious to get out of the influence of the material clutches, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated within him as Paramatma, gives him this knowledge:
"Surrender unto Me." As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, "Give up all other engagements. Just surrender
unto Me." It is to be accepted that the source of knowledge is the Supreme Person. This is also confirmed
in Bhagavad-gita. Mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca. The Lord says, "Through Me one gets real
knowledge and memory, and one also forgets through Me." To one who wants to be materially satisfied or
who wants to lord it over material nature, the Lord gives the opportunity to forget His service and engage
in the so-called happiness of material activities. Similarly, when one is frustrated in lording it over
material nature and is very serious about getting out of this material entanglement, the Lord, from within,
gives him the knowledge that he has to surrender unto Him; then there is liberation.
This knowledge cannot be imparted by anyone other than the Supreme Lord or His representative. In
the Caitanya-caritamrta Lord Caitanya instructs Rupa Gosvami that the living entities wander in life after
life, undergoing the miserable conditions of material existence. But when one is very anxious to get free
from the material entanglement, he gets enlightenment through a spiritual master and Krsna. This means
that Krsna as the Supersoul is seated within the heart of the living entity, and when the living entity is
serious, the Lord directs him to take shelter of His representative, a bona fide spiritual master. Directed
from within and guided externally by the spiritual master, one attains the path of Krsna consciousness,
which is the way out of the material clutches.
Therefore there is no possibility of one's being situated in his own position unless he is blessed by the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless he is enlightened with the supreme knowledge, one has to
undergo the severe penalties of the hard struggle for existence in the material nature. The spiritual master
is therefore the mercy manifestation of the Supreme Person. The conditioned soul has to take direct
instruction from the spiritual master, and thus he gradually becomes enlightened to the path of Krsna
consciousness. The seed of Krsna consciousness is sown within the heart of the conditioned soul, and
when one hears instruction from the spiritual master, the seed fructifies, and one's life is blessed.
