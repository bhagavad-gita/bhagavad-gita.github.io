describe; tattvanam--of the categories of the Absolute Truth; laksanam--the distinctive features; prthak--

<h2>Translation</h2>
The Personality of Godhead, Kapila, continued: My dear mother, now I shall describe unto you the
different categories of the Absolute Truth, knowing which any person can be released from the influence
of the modes of material nature.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As stated in Bhagavad-gita, one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute
Truth, only through devotional service (bhaktya mam abhijanati). As stated in the Bhagavatam, the object
of devotional service is mam, Krsna. And, as explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta, to understand Krsna
means to understand Krsna in His personal form with His internal energy, His external energy, His
expansions and His incarnations. There are many diverse departments of knowledge in understanding
Krsna. Sankhya philosophy is especially meant for persons who are conditioned by this material world. It
is generally understood by the parampara system, or by disciplic succession, to be the science of
devotional service. Preliminary studies of devotional service have already been explained. Now the
analytical study of devotional service will be explained by the Lord, who says that by such an analytical
study, one becomes freed from the modes of material nature. The same assertion is confirmed in
Bhagavad-gita. Tato mam tattvato jnatva: by understanding the Lord according to various categories, one
can become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. This is also explained here. By understanding the
science of devotional service in Sankhya philosophy, one can become free from the modes of material
nature. The eternal self, after becoming freed from the spell of material nature, becomes eligible to enter
into the kingdom of God. As long as one has even a slight desire to enjoy or lord it over material nature,
there is no chance of his being freed from the influence of nature's material modes. Therefore, one has to
understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead analytically, as explained in the Sankhya system of
philosophy by Lord Kapiladeva.
