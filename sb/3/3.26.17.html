<h2>Text</h2>

nirvisesasya manavi
cesta yatah sa bhagavan
kala ity upalaksitah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

without specific qualities; manavi--O daughter of Manu; cesta--movement; yatah--from whom; sah--He;
bhagavan--the Supreme Personality of Godhead; kalah--time; iti--thus; upalaksitah--is designated.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear mother, O daughter of Svayambhuva Manu, the time factor, as I have explained, is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, from whom the creation begins as a result of the agitation of the neutral,
unmanifested nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The unmanifested state of material nature, pradhana, is being explained. The Lord says that when the
unmanifested material nature is agitated by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it begins to
manifest itself in different ways. Before this agitation, it remains in the neutral state, without interaction
by the three modes of material nature. In other words, material nature cannot produce any variety of
manifestations without the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is very nicely explained
in Bhagavad-gita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the products of material nature.
Without His contact, material nature cannot produce anything.
In the Caitanya-caritamrta also, a very suitable example is given in this connection. Although the
nipples on a goat's neck appear to be breast nipples, they do not give milk. Similarly, material nature
appears to the material scientist to act and react in a wonderful manner, but in reality it cannot act
without the agitator, time, who is the representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When time
agitates the neutral state of material nature, material nature begins to produce varieties of manifestations.
Ultimately it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of creation. As a woman cannot
produce children unless impregnated by a man, material nature cannot produce or manifest anything
unless it is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the form of the time factor.
