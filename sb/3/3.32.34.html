<h2>Text</h2>
siddha-carana-gandharvair
munibhis capsaro-ganaih
stuyamanah samudrena
dattarhana-niketanah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
siddha--by the Siddhas; carana--by the Caranas; gandharvaih--by the Gandharvas; munibhih--by the
munis; ca--and; apsarah-ganaih--by the Apsaras (damsels of the heavenly planets); stuyamanah--being
extolled; samudrena--by the ocean; datta--given; arhana--oblations; niketanah--place of residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
While He was passing in the northern direction, all the celestial denizens known as Caranas and
Gandharvas, as well as the munis and the damsels of the heavenly planets, prayed and offered Him all
respects. The ocean offered Him oblations and a place of residence.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is understood that Kapila Muni first went towards the Himalayas and traced the course of the River
Ganges, and He again came to the delta of the Ganges at the sea now known as the Bay of Bengal. The
ocean gave Him residence at a place still known as Ganga-sagara, where the River Ganges meets the sea.
That place is called Ganga-sagara-tirtha, and even today people gather there to offer respects to
Kapiladeva, the original author of the Sankhya system of philosophy. Unfortunately, this Sankhya system
has been misrepresented by an imposter who is also named Kapila, but that other system of philosophy
does not tally with anything described in the Sankhya of Kapila in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.
