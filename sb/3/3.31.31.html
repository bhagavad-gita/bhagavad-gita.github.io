<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
For the sake of the body, which is a source of constant trouble to him and which follows him because
he is bound by ties of ignorance and fruitive activities, he performs various actions which cause him to be
subjected to repeated birth and death.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita it is said that one has to work to satisfy Yajna, or Visnu, for any work done without the
purpose of satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a cause of bondage. In the conditioned state a
living entity, accepting his body as himself, forgets his eternal relationship with the Supreme personality
of Godhead and acts on the interest of his body. He takes the body as himself, his bodily expansions as his
kinsmen, and the land from which his body is born as worshipable. In this way he performs all sorts of
misconceived activities, which lead to his perpetual bondage in repetition of birth and death in various
species.
In modern civilization, the so-called social, national and government leaders mislead people more and
more, under the bodily conception of life, with the result that all the leaders, with their followers, are
gliding down to hellish conditions birth after birth. An example is given in Srimad-Bhagavatam. Andha
yathandhair upaniyamanah: when a blind man leads several other blind men, the result is that all of them
fall down in a ditch. This is actually happening. There are many leaders to lead the ignorant public, but
because every one of them is bewildered by the bodily conception of life, there is no peace and prosperity
in human society. So-called yogis who perform various bodily feats are also in the same category as such
ignorant people because the hatha-yoga system is especially recommended for persons who are grossly
implicated in the bodily conception. The conclusion is that as long as one is fixed in the bodily
conception, he has to suffer birth and death.
