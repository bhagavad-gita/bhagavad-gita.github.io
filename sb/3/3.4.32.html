<h2>Translation</h2>
Sukadeva Gosvami informed the King that Uddhava, being thus instructed by the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, who is the source of all Vedic knowledge and the spiritual master of the three worlds,
reached the pilgrimage site of Badarikasrama and engaged himself there in trance to satisfy the Lord.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Lord Sri Krsna is factually the spiritual master of the three worlds, and He is the original source of all
Vedic knowledge. It is very difficult, however, to understand the personal feature of the Absolute Truth,
even from the Vedas. His personal instructions are needed in order to understand the Personality of
Godhead as the Supreme Absolute Truth. Bhagavad-gita is the evidence of such transcendental knowledge
in gist. One cannot know the Supreme Lord unless one is graced by the Lord Himself. Lord Krsna
exhibited this specific mercy towards Arjuna and Uddhava while He was in the material world.
Undoubtedly Bhagavad-gita was spoken by the Lord on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra just to encourage
Arjuna to fight, and yet to complete the transcendental knowledge of Bhagavad-gita, the Lord instructed
Uddhava. The Lord wanted Uddhava to fulfill His mission and disseminate knowledge which He had not
spoken even in Bhagavad-gita. Persons who are attached to the words of the Vedas may also know from
this verse that the Lord is the source of all Vedic knowledge. One who is unable to understand the
Supreme Personality of Godhead by going through the pages of the Vedas may take shelter of one of the
Lord's devotees, such as Uddhava, in order to advance further in knowledge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. The Brahma-samhita says that it is very difficult to understand the Supreme Personality of
Godhead from the Vedas, but He is easily understood from a pure devotee like Uddhava. Taking mercy on
the great sages who lived at Badarikasrama, the Lord authorized Uddhava to speak on His behalf. Unless
one has such authorization, one cannot understand or preach the devotional service of the Lord.
While present on this earth, the Lord executed many uncommon activities, even traveling in space to
bring down the parijata from heaven and recovering the son of His teacher (Sandipani Muni) from the
regions of death. Uddhava was certainly informed of the conditions of life on other planets, and all the
sages were anxious to know of them, just as we are anxious to know about the planets in space. Uddhava
was particularly deputed to carry a message to Badarikasrama, not only to the sages of that place of
pilgrimage but also to the Nara-Narayana Deities. Such a message must have been more confidential than
the knowledge described in the pages of the Vedas.
The Lord is undoubtedly the source of all knowledge, and the messages dispatched through Uddhava to
Nara-Narayana and other sages were also part of the Vedic knowledge, but they were more confidential
and could be sent or understood only through such a pure devotee as Uddhava. Since such confidential
knowledge was known only to the Lord and Uddhava, it is said that Uddhava was as good as the Lord
Himself. Every living entity can, like Uddhava, also become a confidential messenger on the same level as
the Lord, provided he becomes confidential himself by dint of loving devotional service. Such confidential
knowledge is entrusted, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita only to pure devotees like Uddhava and Arjuna,
and one has to learn the mystery through them, and not otherwise. One cannot understand Bhagavad-gita
or Srimad-Bhagavatam without the help of such confidential devotees of the Lord. According to Srila
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, that confidential message must have concerned the mystery of His
departure and the annihilation of His dynasty after the end of His appearance in the mundane world for
one hundred years. Everyone must have been very anxious to know about the mystery of the annihilation
of the Yadu dynasty, and that message must have been explained by the Lord to Uddhava and dispatched
to Badarikasrama for the information of Nara-Narayana and other pure devotees of the Lord.
