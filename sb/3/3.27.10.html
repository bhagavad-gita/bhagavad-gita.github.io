<h2>Translation</h2>
One should be situated in the transcendental position, beyond the stages of material consciousness, and
should be aloof from all other conceptions of life. Thus realizing freedom from false ego, one should see
his own self just as he sees the sun in the sky.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Consciousness acts in three stages under the material conception of life. When we are awake,
consciousness acts in a particular way, when we are asleep it acts in a different way, and when we are in
deep sleep, consciousness acts in still another way. To become Krsna conscious, one has to become
transcendental to these three stages of consciousness. Our present consciousness should be freed from all
perceptions of life other than consciousness of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called
duri-bhutanya-darsanah, which means that when one attains perfect Krsna consciousness he does not see
anything but Krsna. In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that the perfect devotee may see many movable
and immovable objects, but in everything he sees that the energy of Krsna is acting. As soon as he
remembers the energy of Krsna, he immediately remembers Krsna in His personal form. Therefore in all
his observations he sees Krsna only. In the Brahma-samhita (5.38) it is stated that when one's eyes are
smeared with love of Krsna (premanjana-cchurita), he always sees Krsna, outside and inside. This is
confirmed here; one should be freed from all other vision, and in that way he is freed from the false
egoistic identification and sees himself as the eternal servitor of the Lord. Caksusevarkam: as we can see
the sun without a doubt, one who is fully developed in Krsna consciousness sees Krsna and His energy.
By this vision one becomes atma-drk, or self-realized. When the false ego of identifying the body with the
self is removed, actual vision of life is perceivable. The senses, therefore, also become purified. Real
service of the Lord begins when the senses are purified. One does not have to stop the activities of the
senses, but the false ego of identifying with the body has to be removed. Then the senses automatically
become purified, and with purified senses one can actually discharge devotional service.
