<h2>Text</h2>
uttarayam dhrtah puror
vamsah sadhv-abhimanyuna
sa vai drauny-astra-samplustah
punar bhagavata dhrtah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
uttarayam--unto Uttara; dhrtah--conceived; puroh--of Puru; vamsah--descendant; sadhu-abhimanyuna--
by the hero Abhimanyu; sah--he; vai--certainly; drauni-astra--by the weapon of Drauni, the son of Drona;
samplustah--being burnt; punah--again, for the second time; bhagavata--by the Personality of Godhead;
dhrtah--was protected.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The embryo of Puru's descendant begotten by the great hero Abhimanyu in the womb of Uttara, his
wife, was burnt by the weapon of the son of Drona, but later he was again protected by the Lord.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The embryonic body of Pariksit which was in formation after Uttara's pregnancy by Abhimanyu, the
great hero, was burned by the brahmastra of Asvatthama, but a second body was given by the Lord within
the womb, and thus the descendant of Puru was saved. This incident is the direct proof that the body and
the living entity, the spiritual spark, are different. When the living entity takes shelter in the womb of a
woman through the injection of the semen of a man, there is an emulsification of the man's and woman's
discharges, and thus a body is formed the size of a pea, gradually developing into a complete body. But if
the developing embryo is destroyed in some way or other, the living entity has to take shelter in another
body or in the womb of another woman. The particular living entity who was selected to be the
descendant of Maharaja Puru, or the Pandavas, was not an ordinary living entity, and by the superior will
of the Lord he was destined to be the successor to Maharaja Yudhisthira. Therefore, when Asvatthama
destroyed the embryo of Maharaja Pariksit, the Lord, by His own internal potency, entered into the womb
of Uttara by His plenary portion just to give audience to the would-be Maharaja Pariksit, who was in great
danger. By His appearance within the womb, the Lord encouraged the child and gave him complete
protection in a new body by His omnipotency. By His power of omnipresence He was present both inside
and outside of Uttara and other members of the Pandava family.
