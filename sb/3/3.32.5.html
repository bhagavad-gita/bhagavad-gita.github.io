<h2>Translation</h2>
My dear Lord, You have assumed this body in order to diminish the sinful activities of the fallen and to
enrich their knowledge in devotion and liberation. Since these sinful people are dependent on Your
direction, by Your own will You assume incarnations as a boar and as other forms. Similarly, You have
appeared in order to distribute transcendental knowledge to Your dependents.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In the previous verses, the general transcendental qualifications of the Supreme Personality of Godhead
were described. Now the specific purpose of the Lord's appearance is also described. By His different
energies He bestows different kinds of bodies upon the living entities, who are conditioned by their
propensity to lord it over material nature, but in course of time these living entities become so degraded
that they need enlightenment. It is stated in Bhagavad-gita that whenever there are discrepancies in the
discharge of the real purpose of this material existence, the Lord appears as an incarnation. The Lord's
form as Kapila directs the fallen souls and enriches them with knowledge and devotion so that they may
go back to Godhead. There are many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, like those of
the boar, the fish, the tortoise and the half-man half-lion. Lord Kapiladeva is also one of the incarnations
of Godhead. It is accepted herein that Lord Kapiladeva appeared on the surface of the earth to give
transcendental knowledge to the misguided conditioned souls.
