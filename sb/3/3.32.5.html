dhirah kamartha-hetave
nihsanga nyasta-karmanah

SYNONYMS
ye--those who; sva-dharman--their own occupational duties; na--do not; duhyanti--take advantage of;
dhirah--intelligent; kama--sense gratification; artha--economic development; hetave--for the sake of;
nihsangah--free from material attachment; nyasta--given up; karmanah--fruitive activities; prasantah--
satisfied; suddha-cetasah--of purified consciousness.
TRANSLATION
Those who are intelligent and are of purified consciousness are completely satisfied in Krsna
consciousness. Freed from the modes of material nature, they do not act for sense gratification; rather,
since they are situated in their own occupational duties, they act as one is expected to act.
PURPORT
The first-class example of this type of man is Arjuna. Arjuna was a ksatriya, and his occupational duty
was to fight. Generally, kings fight to extend their kingdoms, which they rule for sense gratification. But
as far as Arjuna is concerned, he declined to fight for his own sense gratification. He said that although he
could get a kingdom by fighting with his relatives, he did not want to fight with them. But when he was
ordered by Krsna and convinced by the teachings of Bhagavad-gita that his duty was to satisfy Krsna, then
he fought. Thus he fought not for his sense gratification but for the satisfaction of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
Persons who work at their prescribed duties, not for sense gratification but for gratification of the
Supreme Lord, are called nihsanga, freed from the influence of the modes of material nature. Nyastakarmanah
indicates that the results of their activities are given to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
Such persons appear to be acting on the platform of their respective duties, but such activities are not
performed for personal sense gratification; rather, they are performed for the Supreme Person. Such
devotees are called prasantah, which means "completely satisfied." Suddha-cetasah means Krsna
conscious; their consciousness has become purified. In unpurified consciousness one thinks of himself as
the Lord of the universe, but in purified consciousness one thinks himself the eternal servant of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. Putting oneself in that position of eternal servitorship to the Supreme
Lord and working for Him perpetually, one actually becomes completely satisfied. As long as one works
for his personal sense gratification, he will always be full of anxiety. That is the difference between
ordinary consciousness and Krsna consciousness.
