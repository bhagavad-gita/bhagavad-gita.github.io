<h2>Translation</h2>
Marking these and many other omens of evil times, everyone but the four sage-sons of Brahma, who
were aware of the fall of Jaya and Vijaya and of their birth as Diti's sons, was seized with fear. They did
not know the secrets of these portents and thought that the dissolution of the universe was at hand.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
According to Bhagavad-gita, Seventh Chapter, the laws of nature are so stringent that it is impossible for
the living entity to surpass their enforcement. It is also explained that only those who are fully
surrendered to Krsna in Krsna consciousness can be saved. We can learn from the description of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam that it is because of the birth of two great demons that there were so many natural
disturbances. It is to be indirectly understood, as previously described, that when there are constant
disturbances on the earth, that is an omen that some demoniac people have been born or that the
demoniac population has increased. In former days there were only two demons--those born of Diti--yet
there were so many disturbances. At the present day, especially in this age of Kali, these disturbances are
always visible, which indicates that the demoniac population has certainly increased.
To check the increase of demoniac population, the Vedic civilization enacted so many rules and
regulations of social life, the most important of which is the garbhadhana process for begetting good
children. In Bhagavad-gita Arjuna informed Krsna that if there is unwanted population (varna-sankara),
the entire world will appear to be hell. People are very anxious for peace in the world, but there are so
many unwanted children born without the benefit of the garbhadhana ceremony, just like the demons
born from Diti. Diti was so lusty that she forced her husband to copulate at a time which was
inauspicious, and therefore the demons were born to create disturbances. In having sex life to beget
children, one should observe the process for begetting nice children; if each and every householder in
every family observes the Vedic system, then there are nice children, not demons, and automatically there
is peace in the world. If we do not follow regulations in life for social tranquillity, we cannot expect peace.
Rather, we will have to undergo the stringent reactions of natural laws.
