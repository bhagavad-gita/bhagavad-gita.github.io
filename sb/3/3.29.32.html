<h2>Text</h2>
daivenasaditam tasya
samalam niraye puman
bhunkte kutumba-posasya
hrta-vitta ivaturah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
daivena--by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; asaditam--obtained; tasya--his;
samalam--sinful reaction; niraye--in a hellish condition; puman--the man; bhunkte--undergoes; kutumbaposasya--
of maintaining a family; hrta-vittah--one whose wealth is lost; iva--like; aturah--suffering.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Thus, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the maintainer of kinsmen is put into
a hellish condition to suffer for his sinful activities, like a man who has lost his wealth.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The example set herein is that the sinful person suffers just like a man who has lost his wealth. The
human form of body is achieved by the conditioned soul after many, many births and is a very valuable
asset. Instead of utilizing this life to get liberation, if one uses it simply for the purpose of maintaining his
so-called family and therefore performs foolish and unauthorized action, he is compared to a man who
has lost his wealth and who, upon losing it, laments. When wealth is lost, there is no use lamenting, but
as long as there is wealth, one has to utilize it properly and thereby gain eternal profit. It may be argued
that when a man leaves his money earned by sinful activities, he also leaves his sinful activities here with
his money. But it is especially mentioned herein that by superior arrangement (daivenasaditam), although
the man leaves behind him his sinfully earned money, he carries the effect of it. When a man steals some
money, if he is caught and agrees to return it, he is not freed from the criminal punishment. By the law of
the state, even though he returns the money, he has to undergo the punishment. Similarly, the money
earned by a criminal process may be left by the man when dying, but by superior arrangement he carries
with him the effect, and therefore he has to suffer hellish life.
