<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Here Vidura inquired about Kardama Muni and his wife, Devahuti, and about their children. It is
described here that Devahuti was very much advanced in the performance of eightfold yoga. The eight
divisions of yoga performance are described as (1) control of the senses, (2) strict following of the rules
and regulations, (3) practice of the different sitting postures, (4) control of the breath, (5) withdrawing
the senses from sense objects, (6) concentration of the mind, (7) meditation and (8) self-realization. After
self-realization there are eight further perfectional stages, which are called yoga-siddhis. The husband and
wife, Kardama and Devahuti, were advanced in yoga practice; the husband was a maha-yogi, great mystic,
and the wife was a yoga-laksana, or one advanced in yoga. They united and produced children. Formerly,
after making their lives perfect, great sages and saintly persons used to beget children, otherwise they
strictly observed the rules and regulations of celibacy. Brahmacarya (following the rules and regulations of
celibacy) is required for perfection of self-realization and mystic power. There is no recommendation in
the Vedic scriptures that one can go on enjoying material sense gratification at one's whims, as one likes,
and at the same time become a great meditator by paying a rascal some money.
