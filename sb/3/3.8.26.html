<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord showed His lotus feet by raising them. His lotus feet are the source of all awards achieved by
devotional service free from material contamination. Such awards are for those who worship Him in pure
devotion. The splendor of the transcendental rays from His moonlike toenails and fingernails appeared
like the petals of a flower.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord fulfills the desires of everyone just as one desires. Pure devotees are interested in achieving the
transcendental service of the Lord, which is nondifferent from Him. Therefore, the Lord is the only desire
of the pure devotees, and devotional service is the only spotless process for achieving His favor. Srila Rupa
Gosvami says in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11) that pure devotional service is jnana-karmadyanavrtam:
pure devotional service is without any tinge of speculative knowledge and fruitive activities.
Such devotional service is able to award the pure devotee the highest result, namely direct association
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna. According to the Gopala-tapani Upanisad, the
Lord showed one of the many thousands of petals of His lotus feet. It is said: brahmano'sav anavaratam
me dhyatah stutah parardhante so 'budhyata gopa-veso me purastat avirbabhuva. After penetrating for
millions of years, Lord Brahma could understand the transcendental form of the Lord as Sri Krsna, in the
dress of a cowherd boy, and thus he recorded his experience in the Brahma-samhita in the famous prayer,
govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami.
