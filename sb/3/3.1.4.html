<h2>Translation</h2>
Saint Vidura was a great and pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his questions to His Grace Rsi
Maitreya must have been very purposeful, on the highest level, and approved by learned circles.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Questions and answers among different classes of men have different value. Inquiries by mercantile men
in a business exchange cannot be expected to be highly purposeful in spiritual values. Questions and
answers by different classes of men can be guessed by the caliber of the persons concerned. In Bhagavadgita,
the discussion was between Lord Sri Krsna and Arjuna, the Supreme Person and the supreme devotee
respectively. The Lord admitted Arjuna to be His devotee and friend (Bg. 4.3), and therefore any sane man
can guess that the discussion was on the topic of the bhakti-yoga system. Actually the whole Bhagavadgita
is based on the principle of bhakti-yoga. There is a difference between karma and karma-yoga. Karma
is regulated action for the enjoyment of the fruit by the performer, but karma-yoga is action performed by
the devotee for the satisfaction of the Lord. Karma-yoga is based on bhakti, or pleasing the Lord, whereas
karma is based on pleasing the senses of the performer himself. According to Srimad-Bhagavatam, one is
advised to approach a bona fide spiritual master when one is actually inclined to question from an
elevated level of spiritual understanding. A common man who has no interest in spiritual values has no
need to approach a spiritual master just as a matter of following fashion.
As a student, Maharaja Pariksit was serious about learning the science of God, and Sukadeva Gosvami
was a bona fide spiritual master in the transcendental science. Both of them knew that the topics
discussed by Vidura and Rsi Maitreya were elevated, and thus Maharaja Pariksit was very interested in
learning from the bona fide spiritual master.
