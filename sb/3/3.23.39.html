<h2>Translation</h2>
In that aerial mansion he traveled to the pleasure valleys of Mount Meru, which were rendered all the
more beautiful by cool, gentle, fragrant breezes that stimulated passion. In these valleys, the treasurer of
the gods, Kuvera, surrounded by beautiful women and praised by the Siddhas, generally enjoys pleasure.
Kardama Muni also, surrounded by the beautiful damsels and his wife, went there and enjoyed for many,
many years.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Kuvera is one of the eight demigods who are in charge of different directions of the universe. It is said
that Indra is in charge of the eastern side of the universe, where the heavenly planet, or paradise, is
situated. Similarly, Agni is in charge of the southeastern portion of the universe; Yama, the demigod who
punishes sinners, is in charge of the southern portion; Nirrti is in charge of the southwestern part of the
universe; Varuna, the demigod in charge of the waters, is in charge of the western portion; Vayu, who
controls the air and who has wings to travel in the air, is in charge of the northwestern part of the
universe; and Kuvera, the treasurer of the demigods, is in charge of the northern part of the universe. All
these demigods take pleasure in the valleys of Mount Meru, which is situated somewhere between the sun
and the earth. In the aerial mansion, Kardama Muni traveled throughout the eight directions controlled
by the different demigods described above, and as the demigods go to Mount Meru, he also went there to
enjoy life. When one is surrounded by young, beautiful girls, sex stimulation naturally becomes
prominent. Kardama Muni was sexually stimulated, and he enjoyed his wife for many, many years in that
part of Mount Meru. But his sex indulgence was praised by many, many Siddhas, beings who have
attained perfection, because it was intended to produce good progeny for the good of universal affairs.
