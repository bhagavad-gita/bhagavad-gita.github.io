<h2>Text</h2>
saumyanusoce tam adhah-patantam
bhratre paretaya vidudruhe yah
niryapito yena suhrt sva-purya
aham sva-putran samanuvratena
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
saumya--O gentle one; anusoce--just lamenting; tam--him; adhah-patantam--gliding down; bhratre--on
his brother's; paretaya--death; vidudruhe--revolted against; yah--one who; niryapitah--driven out; yena--
by whom; suhrt--well-wisher; sva-puryah--from his own house; aham--myself; sva-putran--with his own
sons; samanu-vratena--accepting the same line of action.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O gentle one, I simply lament for he [Dhrtarastra] who rebelled against his brother after death. By him I
was driven out of my own house, although I am his sincere well-wisher, because he accepted the line of
action adopted by his own sons.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Vidura did not ask about the welfare of his elder brother because there was no chance of his well-being,
only news of his gliding down to hell. Vidura was a sincere well-wisher for Dhrtarastra, and he had a
thought about him in the corner of his heart. He lamented that Dhrtarastra could rebel against the sons of
his dead brother Pandu and that he could drive him (Vidura) out of his own house on the dictation of his
crooked sons. In spite of these actions, Vidura never became an enemy of Dhrtarastra but continued to be
his well-wisher, and at the last stage of Dhrtarastra's life, it was Vidura only who proved to be his real
friend. Such is the behavior of a Vaisnava like Vidura: he desires all good, even for his enemies.
