<h2>Text</h2>
yatra pravistam atmanam
vibudhanucara jaguh
vapyam utpala-gandhinyam
kardamenopalalitam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
yatra--where; pravistam--entered; atmanam--unto her; vibudha-anucarah--the associates of the denizens
of heaven; jaguh--sang; vapyam--in the pond; utpala--of lotuses; gandhinyam--with the fragrance;
kardamena--by Kardama; upalalitam--treated with great care.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
When Devahuti would enter that lovely garden to take her bath in the pond filled with lotus flowers, the
associates of the denizens of heaven, the Gandharvas, would sing about Kardama's glorious household
life. Her great husband, Kardama, gave her all protection at all times.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The ideal husband-and-wife relationship is very nicely described in this statement. Kardama Muni gave
Devahuti all sorts of comforts in his duty as a husband, but he was not at all attached to his wife. As soon
as his son, Kapiladeva, was grown up, Kardama at once left all family connection. Similarly, Devahuti was
the daughter of a great king, Svayambhuva Manu, and was qualified and beautiful, but she was completely
dependent on the protection of her husband. According to Manu, women, the fair sex, should not have
independence at any stage of life. In childhood a woman must be under the protection of the parents, in
youth she must be under the protection of the husband, and in old age she must be under the protection
of the grown children. Devahuti demonstrated all these statements of the Manu-samhita in her life: as a
child she was dependent on her father, later she was dependent on her husband, in spite of her opulence,
and she was later on dependent on her son, Kapiladeva.
