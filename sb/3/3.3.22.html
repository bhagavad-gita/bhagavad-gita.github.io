<h2>Text</h2>
tasyaivam ramamanasya
samvatsara-ganan bahun
grhamedhesu yogesu
viragah samajayata
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tasya--His; evam--thus; ramamanasya--enjoying; samvatsara--years; ganan--many; bahun--great many;
grhamedhesu--in household life; yogesu--in sex life; viragah--detachment; samajayata--awakened.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord was thus engaged in household life for many, many years, but at last His detachment from
ephemeral sex life was fully manifested.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Even though the Lord is never attached to any kind of material sex life, as the universal teacher He
remained a householder for many, many years, just to teach others how one should live in householder
life. Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that the word samajayata means "fully exhibited." In all
His activities while present on the earth, the Lord exhibited detachment. This was fully displayed when
He wanted to teach by example that one should not remain attached to household life for all the days of
one's life. One should naturally develop detachment as a matter of course. The Lord's detachment from
household life does not indicate detachment from His eternal associates, the transcendental cowherd
damsels. But the Lord desired to end His so-called attachment to the three modes of material nature. He
can never be detached from the service of His transcendental associates like Rukmini and other goddesses
of fortune, as described in the Brahma-samhita (5.29): laksmi-sahasra-sata-sambhrama-sevyamanam.
