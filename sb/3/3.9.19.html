<h2>Translation</h2>
O my Lord, by Your own will You appear in the various species of living entities, among animals lower
than human beings as well as among the demigods, to perform Your transcendental pastimes. You are not
affected by material contamination. You come just to fulfill the obligations of Your own principles of
religion, and therefore, O Supreme Personality, I offer my obeisances unto You for manifesting such
different forms.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord's incarnations in different species of life are all transcendental. He appears as a human being in
His incarnations of Krsna, Rama, etc., but He is not a human being. Anyone who mistakes Him for an
ordinary human being is certainly not very intelligent, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.11): avajananti
mam mudha manusim tanum asritam. The same principle is applicable when He appears as the hog or
fish incarnations. They are transcendental forms of the Lord and are manifested under certain necessities
of His own pleasure and pastimes. Such manifestations of the transcendental forms of the Lord are
accepted by Him mostly to enliven His devotees. All His incarnations are manifested whenever there is a
need to deliver His devotees and maintain His own principles.
