<h2>Text</h2>
aho papacyamananam
niraye svair amangalaih
kalena bhuyasa nunam
prasidantiha devatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
aho--oh; papacyamananam--with those being much afflicted; niraye--in the hellish material
entanglement; svaih--their own; amangalaih--by misdeeds; kalena bhuyasa--after a long time; nunam--
indeed; prasidanti--they are pleased; iha--in this world; devatah--the demigods.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Kardama Muni said: Oh, after a long time the demigods of this universe have become pleased with the
suffering souls who are in material entanglement because of their own misdeeds.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
This material world is a place for suffering, which is due to the misdeeds of the inhabitants, the
conditioned souls themselves. The sufferings are not extraneously imposed upon them; rather, the
conditioned souls create their own suffering by their own acts. In the forest, fire takes place automatically.
It is not that someone has to go there and set a fire; because of friction among various trees, fire occurs
automatically. When there is too much heat from the forest fire of this material world, the demigods,
including Brahma himself, being harassed, approach the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and appeal to Him to alleviate the condition. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead
descends. In other words, when the demigods become distressed by the sufferings of the conditioned
souls, they approach the Lord to remedy the suffering, and the Personality of Godhead descends. When
the Lord descends, all the demigods become enlivened. Therefore Kardama Muni said, "After many, many
years of human suffering, all the demigods are now satisfied because Kapiladeva, the incarnation of
Godhead, has appeared."
