<h2>Text</h2>
tvayi samsthite gadaya sirna-sirsany
asmad-bhuja-cyutaya ye ca tubhyam
balim haranty rsayo ye ca devah
svayam sarve na bhavisyanty amulah
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tvayi--when You; samsthite--are killed; gadaya--by the mace; sirna--smashed; sirsani--skull; asmatbhuja--
from my hand; cyutaya--released; ye--those who; ca--and; tubhyam--to You; balim--presentations;
haranti--offer; rsayah--sages; ye--those who; ca--and; devah--demigods; svayam--automatically; sarve--all;
na--not; bhavisyanti--will exist; amulah--without roots.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The demon continued: When You fall dead with Your skull smashed by the mace hurled by my arms,
the demigods and sages who offer You oblations and sacrifice in devotional service will also automatically
cease to exist, like trees without roots.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Demons are very much disturbed when devotees worship the Lord in the prescribed ways recommended
in the scriptures. In the Vedic scriptures, the neophyte devotees are advised to engage in nine kinds of
devotional service, such as to hear and chant the holy name of God, to remember Him always, to chant on
beads Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare,
to worship the Lord in the form of His Deity incarnation in the temples, and to engage in various activities
of Krsna consciousness to increase the number of godly persons for perfect peace in the world. Demons
do not like such activity. They are always envious of God and His devotees. Their propaganda not to
worship in the temple or church but simply to make material advancement for satisfaction of the senses is
always current. The demon Hiranyaksa, upon seeing the Lord face to face, wanted to make a permanent
solution by killing the Personality of Godhead with his powerful mace. The example of an uprooted tree
mentioned here by the demon is very significant. Devotees accept that God is the root of everything. Their
example is that just as the stomach is the source of energy of all the limbs of the body, God is the original
source of all energy manifested in the material and spiritual worlds; therefore, as supplying food to the
stomach is the process to satisfy all the limbs of the body, Krsna consciousness, or developing love of
Krsna, is the sublime method for satisfying the source of all happiness. The demon wants to uproot this
source because if the root, God, were to be checked, the activities of the Lord and the devotees would
automatically stop. The demon would be very much satisfied by such a situation in society. Demons are
always anxious to have a godless society for their sense gratification. According to Sridhara Svami, this
verse means that when the demon would be deprived of his mace by the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
not only the neophyte devotees but also the ancient sagacious devotees of the Lord would be very much
satisfied.
