<h2>Text</h2>
ta ekada bhagavato
vaikunthasyamalatmanah
yayur vaikuntha-nilayam
sarva-loka-namaskrtam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
te--they; ekada--once upon a time; bhagavatah--of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vaikunthasya--
of Lord Visnu; amala-atmanah--being freed from all material contamination; yayuh--entered; vaikunthanilayam--
the abode named Vaikuntha; sarva-loka--by the residents of all the material planets;
namaskrtam--worshiped.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
After thus traveling all over the universes, they also entered into the spiritual sky, for they were freed
from all material contamination. In the spiritual sky there are spiritual planets known as Vaikunthas,
which are the residence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees and are worshiped
by the residents of all the material planets.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The material world is full of cares and anxieties. In any one of the planets, beginning from the highest
down to the lowest, Patala, every living creature must be full of cares and anxieties because in the material
planets one cannot live eternally. The living entities, however, are actually eternal. They want an eternal
home, an eternal residence, but because of accepting a temporal abode in the material world, they are
naturally full of anxiety. In the spiritual sky the planets are called Vaikuntha because the residents of
these planets are free from all anxieties. For them there is no question of birth, death, old age and
diseases, and therefore they are not anxious. On the other hand, the residents of the material planets are
always afraid of birth, death, disease and old age, and therefore they are full of anxieties.
