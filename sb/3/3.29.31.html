<h2>Text</h2>
ekah prapadyate dhvantam
hitvedam sva-kalevaram
kusaletara-patheyo
bhuta-drohena yad bhrtam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ekah--alone; prapadyate--he enters; dhvantam--darkness; hitva--after quitting; idam--this; sva--his;
kalevaram--body; kusala-itara--sin; patheyah--his passage money; bhuta--to other living entities;
drohena--by injury; yat--which body; bhrtam--was maintained.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
He goes alone to the darkest regions of hell after quitting the present body, and the money he acquired
by envying other living entities is the passage money with which he leaves this world.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
When a man earns money by unfair means and maintains his family and himself with that money, the
money is enjoyed by many members of the family, but he alone goes to hell. A person who enjoys life by
earning money or by envying another's life, and who enjoys with family and friends, will have to enjoy
alone the resultant sinful reactions accrued from such violent and illicit life. For example, if a man secures
some money by killing someone and with that money maintains his family, those who enjoy the black
money earned by him are also partially responsible and are also sent to hell, but he who is the leader is
especially punished. The result of material enjoyment is that one takes with him the sinful reaction only,
and not the money. The money he earned is left in this world, and he takes only the reaction.
In this world also, if a person acquires some money by murdering someone, the family is not hanged,
although its members are sinfully contaminated. But the man who commits the murder and maintains his
family is himself hanged as a murderer. The direct offender is more responsible for sinful activities than
the indirect enjoyer. The great learned scholar Canakya Pandita says, therefore, that whatever one has in
his possession had better be spent for the cause of sat, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because
one cannot take his possessions with him. They remain here, and they will be lost. Either we leave the
money or the money leaves us, but we will be separated. The best use of money as long as it is within our
possession is to spend it to acquire Krsna consciousness.
