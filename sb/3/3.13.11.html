TRANSLATION
My dear boy, I have already selected the following places for your residence: the heart, the senses, the
air of life, the sky, the air, the fire, the water, the earth, the sun, the moon and austerity.
PURPORT
The creation of Rudra from between the eyebrows of Brahma as the result of his anger, generated from
the mode of passion partly touched by ignorance, is very significant. In Bhagavad-gita (3.37) the principle
of Rudra is described. Krodha (anger) is the product of kama (lust), which is the result of the mode of
passion. When lust and hankering are unsatisfied, the element of krodha appears, which is the formidable
enemy of the conditioned soul. This most sinful and inimical passion is represented as ahankara, or the
false egocentric attitude of thinking oneself to be all in all. Such an egocentric attitude on the part of the
conditioned soul, who is completely under the control of material nature, is described in Bhagavad-gita as
foolish. The egocentric attitude is a manifestation of the Rudra principle in the heart, wherein krodha
(anger) is generated. This anger develops in the heart and is further manifested through various senses,
like the eyes, hands and legs. When a man is angry he expresses such anger with red-hot eyes and
sometimes makes a display of clenching his fists or kicking his legs. This exhibition of the Rudra principle
is the proof of Rudra's presence in such places. When a man is angry he breathes very rapidly, and thus
Rudra is represented in the air of life, or in the activities of breathing. When the sky is overcast with dense
clouds and roars in anger, and when the wind blows very fiercely, the Rudra principle is manifested, and
so also when the sea water is infuriated by the wind it appears in a gloomy feature of Rudra, which is very
fearful to the common man. When fire is ablaze we can also experience the presence of Rudra, and when
there is an inundation over the earth we can understand that this is also the representation of Rudra.
There are many earthly creatures who constantly represent the Rudra element. The snake, tiger and lion
are always representations of Rudra. Sometimes, because of the extreme heat of the sun, there are cases of
heatstroke, and due to the extreme coldness created by the moon there are cases of collapse. There are
many sages empowered with the influence of austerity and many yogis, philosophers and renouncers who
sometimes exhibit their acquired power under the influence of the Rudra principle of anger and passion.
The great yogi Durvasa, under the influence of this Rudra principle, picked a quarrel with Maharaja
Ambarisa, and a brahmana boy exhibited the Rudra principle by cursing the great King Pariksit. When the
Rudra principle is exhibited by persons who are not engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, the angry person falls down from the peak of his improved position. This is
confirmed as follows:
ye 'nye 'ravindaksa vimukta-maninas
tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah
aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah
patanty adho 'nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah
(Bhag. 10.2.32)
The most lamentable falldown of the impersonalist is due to his false and unreasonable claim of being
one with the Supreme.
