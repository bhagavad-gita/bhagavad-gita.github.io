<h2>Translation</h2>
The great sage Parasara, as aforementioned, being so advised by the great sage Pulastya, spoke unto me
the foremost of the Puranas [Bhagavatam]. I shall also describe this before you, my dear son, in terms of
my hearing, because you are always my faithful follower.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The great sage of the name Pulastya is the father of all demoniac descendants. Once upon a time
Parasara began a sacrifice in which all the demons were to be burnt to death because his father had been
killed and devoured by one of them. The great sage Vasistha Muni arrived at the sacrifice and requested
Parasara to stop the deadly action, and because of Vasistha's position and respect in the community of
sages, Parasara could not deny the request. Parasara having stopped the sacrifice, Pulastya, the father of
the demons, appreciated his brahminical temperament and gave the blessing that in the future he would
be a great speaker on the Vedic literatures called the Puranas, the supplements of the Vedas. Parasara's
action was appreciated by Pulastya because Parasara had forgiven the demons out of his brahminical
power of forgiveness. Parasara was able to demolish all the demons in the sacrifice, but he considered,
"Demons are so made that they devour living creatures, men and animals, but why on that account should
I withdraw my brahminical qualification of forgiveness?" As the great speaker of the Puranas, Parasara
first of all spoke on the Srimad-Bhagavata Purana because it is the foremost of all the Puranas. Maitreya
Muni desired to narrate the same Bhagavatam be had heard from Parasara, and Vidura was qualified to
hear it because of his faithfulness and his following the instructions received from superiors. So Srimad-
Bhagavatam was being narrated from time immemorial by the disciplic succession, even before the time of
Vyasadeva. The so-called historians calculate the Puranas to be only a few hundred years old, but factually
the Puranas existed from time immemorial, before all historical calculations by the mundaners and
speculative philosophers.
