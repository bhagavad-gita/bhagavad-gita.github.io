<h2>Translation</h2>
Lord Brahma said: My dear demigods, the human form of life is of such importance that we also desire
to have such life, for in the human form one can attain perfect religious truth and knowledge. If one in
this human form of life does not understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His abode, it is to
be understood that he is very much affected by the influence of external nature.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Brahmaji condemns very vehemently the condition of the human being who does not take interest in
the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental abode, Vaikuntha. The human form of life is desired
even by Brahmaji. Brahma and other demigods have much better material bodies than human beings, yet
the demigods, including Brahma, nevertheless desire to attain the human form of life because it is
specifically meant for the living entity who can attain transcendental knowledge and religious perfection.
It is not possible to go back to Godhead in one life, but in the human form one should at least understand
the goal of life and begin Krsna consciousness. It is said that the human form is a great boon because it is
the most suitable boat for crossing over the nescience ocean. The spiritual master is considered to be the
most able captain in that boat, and the information from the scriptures is the favorable wind for floating
over the ocean of nescience. The human being who does not take advantage of all these facilities in this
life is committing suicide. Therefore one who does not begin Krsna consciousness in the human form of
life loses his life to the influence of the illusory energy. Brahma regrets the situation of such a human
being.
