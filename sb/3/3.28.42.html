<h2>Text</h2>

agnir indhe sa-giribhir
bhur na majjati yad-bhayat
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>

<h2>Translation</h2>
Out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the rivers flow, and the ocean never overflows. Out
of fear of Him only does fire burn and does the earth, with its mountains, not sink in the water of the
universe.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
We can understand from the Vedic literature that this universe is half filled with water, on which
Garbhodakasayi Visnu is lying. From His abdomen a lotus flower has grown, and within the stem of that
lotus flower all the different planets exist. The material scientist explains that all these different planets
are floating because of the law of gravity or some other law; but the actual lawmaker is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When we speak of law, we must understand that there must be a lawmaker. The
material scientists can discover laws of nature, but they are unable to recognize the lawmaker. From
Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita we can know who the lawmaker is: the lawmaker is the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
It is said here that the planets do not sink. Since they are floating under the order or energy of the
Supreme Godhead, they do not fall down into the water which covers half the universe. All the planets are
heavy, with their various mountains, seas, oceans, cities, palaces and buildings, and yet they are floating.
It is understood from this passage that all the other planets that are floating in the air have oceans and
mountains similar to those on this planet.
