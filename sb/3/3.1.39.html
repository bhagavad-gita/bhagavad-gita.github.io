the sons of Prtha; vrtau--protected; paksmabhih--by shields; aksini--of the eyes; iva--like; remate--playing

<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Are the twin brothers who are protected by their brothers doing well? Just as the eye is always protected
by the eyelid, they are protected by the sons of Prtha, who snatched back their rightful kingdom from the
hands of their enemy Duryodhana, just as Garuda snatched nectar from the mouth of Indra, the
thunderbolt carrier.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Indra, the King of heaven, carries a thunderbolt in his hand and is very strong, yet Garuda, the carrier of
Lord Visnu, was able to snatch nectar from his mouth. Similarly, Duryodhana was as strong as the King of
heaven, and still the sons of Prtha, the Pandavas, were able to snatch away their kingdom from
Duryodhana. Both Garuda and the Parthas are pet devotees of the Lord, and thus it was possible for them
to face such strong enemies.
Vidura's inquiry was about the youngest brothers of the Pandavas, namely Nakula and Sahadeva. These
twin brothers were sons of Madri, the stepmother of the other Pandavas. But although they were
stepbrothers, because Kunti took charge of them after the departure of Madri with her husband Maharaja
Pandu, Nakula and Sahadeva were as good as the other three Pandavas, Yudhisthira, Bhima and Arjuna.
The five brothers are known in the world as regular brothers. The three elder Pandavas took care of the
younger brothers, just as the eyelid takes care of the eye. Vidura was anxious to know whether, after
winning back their own kingdom from the hands of Duryodhana, the younger brothers were still living
happily under the care of the elder brothers.
