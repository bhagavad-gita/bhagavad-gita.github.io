TRANSLATION
O descendant of Kuru, Brahma, the most independent demigod of the universe, accompanied by his
followers, came to see the terrible fight for the sake of the world between the demon and the Personality
of Godhead, who appeared in the form of a boar.
PURPORT
The fight between the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the demon is compared to a fight
between bulls for the sake of a cow. The earth planet is also called go, or cow. As bulls fight between
themselves to ascertain who will have union with a cow, there is always a constant fight between the
demons and the Supreme Lord or His representative for supremacy over the earth. Here the Lord is
significantly described as yajnavayava. One should not consider the Lord to have the body of an ordinary
boar. He can assume any form, and He possesses all such forms eternally. It is from Him that all other
forms have emanated. This boar form is not to be considered the form of an ordinary hog; His body is
actually full of yajna, or worshipful offerings. Yajna (sacrifices) are offered to Visnu. Yajna means the
body of Visnu. His body is not material; therefore He should not be taken to be an ordinary boar.
Brahma is described in this verse as svarat. Actually, full independence is exclusive to the Lord Himself,
but as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, every living entity has a minute quantity of independence.
Each and every one of the living entities within this universe has this minute independence, but Brahma,
being the chief of all living entities, has a greater potential of independence than any other. He is the
representative of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and has been assigned to preside over
universal affairs. All other demigods work for him; therefore he is described here as svarat. He is always
accompanied by great sages and transcendentalists, all of whom came to see the bullfight between the
demon and the Lord.
