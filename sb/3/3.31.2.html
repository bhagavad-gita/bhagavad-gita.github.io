<h2>Translation</h2>
Such persons are ever bereft of devotional service due to being too attached to sense gratification, and
therefore, although they perform various kinds of sacrifices and take great vows to satisfy the demigods
and forefathers, they are not interested in Krsna consciousness, devotional service.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
In Bhagavad-gita (7.20) it is said that persons who worship demigods have lost their intelligence:
kamais tais tair hrta jnanah. They are much attracted to sense gratification, and therefore they worship the
demigods. It is, of course, recommended in the Vedic scriptures that if one wants money, health or
education, then he should worship the various demigods. A materialistic person has manifold demands,
and thus there are manifold demigods to satisfy his senses. The grhamedhis, who want to continue a
prosperous materialistic way of life, generally worship the demigods or the forefathers by offering pinda,
or respectful oblations. Such persons are bereft of Krsna consciousness and are not interested in
devotional service to the Lord. This kind of so-called pious and religious man is the result of
impersonalism. The impersonalists maintain that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no form and that one
can imagine any form he likes for his benefit and worship in that way. Therefore the grhamedhis or
materialistic men say that they can worship any form of a demigod as worship of the Supreme Lord.
Especially amongst the Hindus, those who are meat-eaters prefer to worship goddess Kali because it is
prescribed that one can sacrifice a goat before that goddess. They maintain that whether one worships the
goddess Kali or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Visnu or any demigod, the destination is the same.
This is first-class rascaldom, and such people are misled. But they prefer this philosophy. Bhagavad-gita
does not accept such rascaldom, and it is clearly stated that such methods are meant for persons who have
lost their intelligence. The same judgment is confirmed here, and the word kama-mudha, meaning one
who has lost his sense or is infatuated by the lust of attraction for sense gratification, is used. Kamamudhas
are bereft of Krsna consciousness and devotional service and are infatuated by a strong desire for
sense gratification. The worshipers of demigods are condemned both in Bhagavad-gita and in Srimad-
Bhagavatam.
