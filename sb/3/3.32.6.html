<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a
person born in a family of dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once
utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chants about Him, hears about His
pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Herein the spiritual potency of chanting, hearing or remembering the holy name of the Supreme Lord is
greatly stressed. Rupa Gosvami has discussed the sequence of sinful activities of the conditioned soul, and
he has established, in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, that those who engage in devotional service become freed
from the reactions of all sinful activities. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita. The Lord says that He
takes charge of one who surrenders unto Him, and He makes him immune to all reactions to sinful
activities. If by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one becomes so swiftly
cleared of all reactions to sinful activities, then what is to be said of those persons who see Him face to
face?
Another consideration here is that persons who are purified by the process of chanting and hearing
become immediately eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices. Generally, only a person who is born in a family
of brahmanas, who has been reformed by the ten kinds of purificatory processes and who is learned in
Vedic literature is allowed to perform the Vedic sacrifices. But here the word sadyah, "immediately," is
used, and Sridhara Svami also remarks that one can immediately become eligible to perform Vedic
sacrifices. A person born in a family of the low caste which is accustomed to eat dogs is so positioned due
to his past sinful activities, but by chanting or hearing once in pureness, or in an offenseless manner, he is
immediately relieved of the sinful reaction. Not only is he relieved of the sinful reaction, but he
immediately achieves the result of all purificatory processes. Taking birth in the family of a brahmana is
certainly due to pious activities in one's past life. But still a child who is born in a family of a brahmana
depends for his further reformation upon initiation into acceptance of a sacred thread and many other
reformatory processes. But a person who chants the holy name of the Lord, even if born in a family of
candalas, dog-eaters, does not need reformation. Simply by chanting Hare Krsna, he immediately becomes
purified and becomes as good as the most learned brahmana.
Sridhara Svami especially remarks in this connection, anena pujyatvam laksyate. Some caste brahmanas
remark that by chanting Hare Krsna, purification begins. Of course, that depends on the individual
process of chanting, but this remark of Sridhara Svami's is completely applicable if one chants the holy
name of the Lord without offense, for he immediately becomes more than a brahmana. As Sridhara Svami
says, pujyatvam: he immediately becomes as respectable as a most learned brahmana and can be allowed
to perform Vedic sacrifices. If simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes sanctified
instantly, then what can be said of those persons who see the Supreme Lord face to face and who
understand the descent of the Lord, as Devahuti understands Kapiladeva.
Usually, initiation depends on the bona fide spiritual master, who directs the disciple. If he sees that a
disciple has become competent and purified by the process of chanting, he offers the sacred thread to the
disciple just so that he will be recognized as one-hundred-percent equal with a brahmana. This is also
confirmed in the Hari-bhakti-vilasa by Sri Sanatana Gosvami: "As a base metal like bell metal can be
changed into gold by a chemical process, any person can similarly be changed into a brahmana by diksavidhana,
the initiation process".
It is sometimes remarked that by the chanting process one begins to purify himself and can take birth in
his next life in a brahmana family and then be reformed. But at this present moment, even those who are
born in the best brahmana families are not reformed, nor is there any certainty that they are actually born
of brahmana fathers. Formerly the garbhadhana reformatory system was prevalent, but at the present
moment there is no such garbhadhana, or seed-giving ceremony. Under these circumstances, no one
knows if a man is factually born of a brahmana father. Whether one has acquired the qualification of a
brahmana depends on the judgment of the bona fide spiritual master. He bestows upon the disciple the
position of a brahmana by his own judgment. When one is accepted as a brahmana in the sacred thread
ceremony under the pancaratrika system, then he is dvija, twice-born. That is confirmed by Sanatana
Gosvami: dvijatvam jayate. By the process of initiation by the spiritual master, a person is accepted as a
brahmana in his purified state of chanting the holy name of the Lord. He then makes further progress to
become a qualified Vaisnava, which means that the brahminical qualification is already acquired.
