jivo hy asyanugo deho
bhutendriya-mano-mayah
tan-nirodho 'sya maranam
avirbhavas tu sambhavah
SYNONYMS
jivah--the living entity; hi--indeed; asya--of him; anugah--suitable; dehah--body; bhuta--gross material
elements; indriya--senses; manah--mind; mayah--made of; tat--of the body; nirodhah--destruction; asya--
of the living entity; maranam--death; avirbhavah--manifestation; tu--but; sambhavah--birth.
TRANSLATION
In this way the living entity gets a suitable body with a material mind and senses, according to his
fruitive activities. When the reaction of his particular activity comes to an end, that end is called death,
and when a particular type of reaction begins, that beginning is called birth.
PURPORT
From time immemorial, the living entity travels in the different species of life and the different planets,
almost perpetually. This process is explained in Bhagavad-gita. Bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantrarudhani
mayaya: under the spell of maya, everyone is wandering throughout the universe on the carriage of the
body offered by the material energy. Materialistic life involves a series of actions and reactions. It is a long
film spool of actions and reactions, and one life-span is just a flash in such a reactionary show. When a
child is born, it is to be understood that his particular type of body is the beginning of another set of
activities, and when an old man dies, it is to be understood that one set of reactionary activities is
finished.
We can see that because of different reactionary activities, one man is born in a rich family, and another
is born in a poor family, although both of them are born in the same place, at the same moment and in the
same atmosphere. One who is carrying pious activity with him is given a chance to take his birth in a rich
or pious family, and one who is carrying impious activity is given a chance to take birth in a lower, poor
family. The change of body means a change to a different field of activities. Similarly, when the body of
the boy changes into that of a youth, the boyish activities change into youthful activities.
It is clear that a particular body is given to the living entity for a particular type of activity. This process
is going on perpetually, from a time which is impossible to trace out. Vaisnava poets say, therefore, anadi
karama-phale, which means that these actions and reactions of one's activity cannot be traced, for they
may even continue from the last millennium of Brahma's birth to the next millennium. We have seen the
example in the life of Narada Muni. In one millennium he was the son of a maidservant, and in the next
millennium he became a great sage.

SYNONYMS
dravya--of objects; upalabdhi--of perception; sthanasya--of the place; dravya--of objects; iksa--of
perception; ayogyata--incapability; yada--when; tat--that; pancatvam--death; aham-manat--from the
misconception of "I"; utpattih--birth; dravya--the physical body; darsanam--viewing; yatha--just as;
aksnoh--of the eyes; dravya--of objects; avayava--parts; darsana--of seeing; ayogyata--incapability; yada--
when; tada--then; eva--indeed; caksusah--of the sense of sight; drastuh--of the seer; drastrtva--of the
faculty of seeing; ayogyata--incapability; anayoh--of both of these.
TRANSLATION
When the eyes lose their power to see color or form due to morbid affliction of the optic nerve, the
sense of sight becomes deadened. The living entity, who is the seer of both the eyes and the sight, loses
his power of vision. In the same way, when the physical body, the place where perception of objects
occurs, is rendered incapable of perceiving, that is known as death. When one begins to view the physical
body as one's very self, that is called birth.
PURPORT
When one says, "I see," this means that he sees with his eyes or with his spectacles; he sees with the
instrument of sight. If the instrument of sight is broken or becomes diseased or incapable of acting, then
he, as the seer, also ceases to act. Similarly, in this material body, at the present moment the living soul is
acting, and when the material body, due to its incapability to function, ceases, he also ceases to perform
his reactionary activities. When one's instrument of action is broken and cannot function, that is called
death. Again, when one gets a new instrument for action, that is called birth. This process of birth and
death is going on at every moment, by constant bodily change. The final change is called death, and
acceptance of a new body is called birth. That is the solution to the question of birth and death. Actually,
the living entity has neither birth nor death, but is eternal. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, na hanyate
hanyamane sarire: the living entity never dies, even after the death or annihilation of this material body.
