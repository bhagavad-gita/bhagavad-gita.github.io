<h2>Text</h2>
ahimsa satyam asteyam
yavad-artha-parigrahah
brahmacaryam tapah saucam
svadhyayah purusarcanam
<br>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
ahimsa--nonviolence; satyam--truthfulness; asteyam--refraining from theft; yavat-artha--as much as
necessary; parigrahah--possessing; brahmacaryam--celibacy; tapah--austerity; saucam--cleanliness; svaadhyayah--
study of the Vedas; purusa-arcanam--worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Translation</h2>
One should practice nonviolence and truthfulness, should avoid thieving and be satisfied with
possessing as much as he needs for his maintenance. He should abstain from sex life, perform austerity, be
clean, study the Vedas and worship the supreme form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The word purusarcanam in this verse means worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, especially
the form of Lord Krsna. In Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed by Arjuna that Krsna is the original purusa, or
Personality of Godhead, purusam sasvatam. Therefore in yoga practice one not only must concentrate his
mind on the person of Krsna, but must also worship the form or Deity of Krsna daily.
A brahmacari practices celibacy, controlling his sex life. One cannot enjoy unrestricted sex life and
practice yoga; this is rascaldom. So-called yogis advertise that one can go on enjoying as one likes and
simultaneously become a yogi, but this is totally unauthorized. It is very clearly explained here that one
must observe celibacy. Brahmacaryam means that one leads his life simply in relationship with Brahman,
or in full Krsna consciousness. Those who are too addicted to sex life cannot observe the regulations
which will lead them to Krsna consciousness. Sex life should be restricted to persons who are married. A
person whose sex life is restricted in marriage is also called a brahmacari.
The word asteyam is also very important for a yogi. Asteyam means "to refrain from theft." In the
broader sense, everyone who accumulates more than he needs is a thief. According to spiritual
communism, one cannot possess more than he needs for his personal maintenance. That is the law of
nature. Anyone who accumulates more money or more possessions than he needs is called a thief, and
one who simply accumulates wealth without spending for sacrifice or for worship of the Personality of
Godhead is a great thief.
Svadhyayah means "reading the authorized Vedic scriptures." Even if one is not Krsna conscious and is
practicing the yoga system, he must read standard Vedic literatures in order to understand. Performance
of yoga alone is not sufficient. Narottama dasa Thakura, a great devotee and acarya in the Gaudiya
Vaisnava-sampradaya, says that all spiritual activities should be understood from three sources, namely
saintly persons, standard scriptures and the spiritual master. These three guides are very important for
progress in spiritual life. The spiritual master prescribes standard literature for the prosecution of the yoga
of devotional service, and he himself speaks only from scriptural reference. Therefore reading standard
scriptures is necessary for executing yoga. Practicing yoga without reading the standard literatures is
simply a waste of time.
