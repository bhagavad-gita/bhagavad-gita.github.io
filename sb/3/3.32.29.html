yatha mahan aham-rupas
tri-vrt panca-vidhah svarat
ekadasa-vidhas tasya
vapur andam jagad yatah
SYNONYMS
yatha--as; mahan--the mahat-tattva; aham-rupah--the false ego; tri-vrt--the three modes of material
nature; panca-vidhah--the five material elements; sva-rat--the individual consciousness; ekadasa-vidhah--
the eleven senses; tasya--of the living entity; vapuh--the material body; andam--the brahmanda; jagat--the
universe; yatah--from which or from whom.
TRANSLATION
From the total energy, the mahat-tattva, I have manifested the false ego, the three modes of material
nature, the five material elements, the individual consciousness, the eleven senses and the material body.
Similarly, the entire universe has come from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORT
The Supreme Lord is described as mahat-pada, which means that the total material energy, known as
the mahat-tattva, is lying at His lotus feet. The origin or the total energy of the cosmic manifestation is the
mahat-tattva. From the mahat-tattva all the other twenty-four divisions have sprung, namely the eleven
senses (including the mind), the five sense objects, the five material elements, and then consciousness,
intelligence and false ego. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of the mahat-tattva, and
therefore, in one sense, because everything is an emanation from the Supreme Lord, there is no difference
between the Lord and the cosmic manifestation. But at the same time the cosmic manifestation is different
from the Lord. The word svarat is very significant here. Svarat means "independent." The Supreme Lord is
independent, and the individual soul is also independent. Although there is no comparison between the
two qualities of independence, the living entity is minutely independent, and the Supreme Lord is fully
independent. As the individual soul has a material body made of five elements and the senses, the
supreme independent Lord similarly has the gigantic body of the universe. The individual body is
temporary; similarly, the entire universe, which is considered to be the body of the Supreme Lord, is also
temporary, and both the individual and universal bodies are products of the mahat-tattva. One has to
understand the differences with intelligence. Everyone knows that his material body has developed from a
spiritual spark, and similarly the universal body has developed from the supreme spark, Supersoul. As the
individual body develops from the individual soul, the gigantic body of the universe develops from the
Supreme Soul. Just as the individual soul has consciousness, the Supreme Soul is also conscious. But
although there is a similarity between the consciousness of the Supreme Soul and the consciousness of the
individual soul, the individual soul's consciousness is limited, whereas the consciousness of the Supreme
Soul is unlimited. This is described in Bhagavad-gita (13.3). Ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi: the Supersoul is
present in every field of activity, just as the individual soul is present in the individual body. Both of them
are conscious. The difference is that the individual soul is conscious of the individual body only, whereas
the Supersoul is conscious of the total number of individual bodies.
