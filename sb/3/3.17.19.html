<h2>Text</h2>
cakre hiranyakasipur
dorbhyam brahma-varena ca
vase sa-palal lokams trin
akuto-mrtyur uddhatah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
cakre--made; hiranyakasipuh--Hiranyakasipu; dorbhyam--by his two arms; brahma-varena--by the
benediction of Brahma; ca--and; vase--under his control; sa-palan--along with their protectors; lokan--the
worlds; trin--three; akutah-mrtyuh--fearing death from no one; uddhatah--puffed up.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The elder child, Hiranyakasipu, was unafraid of death from anyone within the three worlds because he
received a benediction from Lord Brahma. He was proud and puffed up due to this benediction and was
able to bring all three planetary systems under his control.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
As will be revealed in later chapters, Hiranyakasipu underwent severe austerity and penance to satisfy
Brahma and thus receive a benediction of immortality. Actually, it is impossible even for Lord Brahma to
give anyone the benediction of becoming immortal, but indirectly Hiranyakasipu received the benediction
that no one within this material world would be able to kill him. In other words, because he originally
came from the abode of Vaikuntha, he was not to be killed by anyone within this material world. The
Lord desired to appear Himself to kill him. One may be very proud of his material advancement in
knowledge, but he cannot be immune to the four principles of material existence, namely birth, death, old
age and disease. It was the Lord's plan to teach people that even Hiranyakasipu, who was so powerful and
strongly built, could not live more than his destined duration of life. One may become as strong and
puffed up as Hiranyakasipu and bring under his control all the three worlds, but there is no possibility of
continuing life eternally or keeping the conquered booty forever. So many emperors have ascended to
power, and they are now lost in oblivion; that is the history of the world.
