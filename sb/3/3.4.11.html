sri-bhagavan uvaca
vedaham antar manasipsitam te
dadami yat tad duravapam anyaih

<p></p>

sri-bhagavan uvaca--the Personality of Godhead said; veda--know; aham--I; antah--within; manasi--the
mind; ipsitam--what you desired; te--your; dadami--I give you; yat--which is; tat--that; duravapam--very
difficult to achieve; anyaih--by others; satre--in the sacrifice; pura--in the days of yore; visva-srjam--of
those who expanded this creation; vasunam--of the Vasus; mat-siddhi-kamena--with a desire to achieve

<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
O Vasu, I know from within your mind what you desired in the days of yore when the Vasus and other
demigods responsible for expanding the universal affairs performed sacrifices. You particularly desired to
achieve My association. This is very difficult to obtain for others, but I award it unto you.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Uddhava is one of the eternal associates of the Lord, and a plenary portion of Uddhava was one of the
eight Vasus in the days of yore. The eight Vasus and the demigods in the upper planetary system, who are
responsible for the management of the universal affairs, performed a sacrifice in the days of yore, desiring
to fulfill their respective ultimate goals in life. At that time an expansion of Uddhava, acting as one of the
Vasus, desired to become an associate of the Lord. The Lord knew this because He is present in the heart
of every living entity as Paramatma, the Superconsciousness. In everyone's heart there is the
representation of the Superconsciousness, who gives memory to the partial consciousness of every living
entity. The living entity, as partial consciousness, forgets incidents of his past life, but the
Superconsciousness reminds him how to act in terms of his past cultivation of knowledge. Bhagavad-gita
confirms this fact in various ways: ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham (Bg. 4.11),
sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca (Bg. 15.15).
Everyone is at liberty to desire as he likes, but the desire is fulfilled by the Supreme Lord. Everyone is
independent to think or desire, but the fulfillment of one's desire depends on the supreme will. This law is
expressed as "Man proposes, God disposes." In the days of yore, when the demigods and Vasus performed
sacrifice, Uddhava, as one of the Vasus, desired to enter into the association of the Lord, which is very
difficult for those busy in empiric philosophical speculation or fruitive activities. Such persons have
practically no information of the facts about becoming an associate of the Lord. Only the pure devotees
can know, by the mercy of the Lord, that the personal association of the Lord is the highest perfection of
life. The Lord assured Uddhava that He would fulfill his desire. It appears that when the Lord informed
him by His indication to Uddhava, the great sage Maitreya finally became aware of the importance of
entering into the association of the Lord.
