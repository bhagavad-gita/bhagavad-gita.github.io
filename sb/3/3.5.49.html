<h2>Translation</h2>
O unborn one, please enlighten us regarding the ways and means by which we can offer You all
enjoyable grains and commodities so that both we and all other living entities in this world can maintain
ourselves without disturbance and can easily accumulate the necessities of life both for You and for
ourselves.
<br>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Developed consciousness begins from the human form of life and further increases in the forms of the
demigods living in higher planets. The earth is situated almost in the middle of the universe, and the
human form of life is the via medium between the life of the demigods and that of the demons. The
planetary systems above the earth are especially meant for the higher intellectuals, called demigods. They
are called demigods because although their standard of life is far more advanced in culture, enjoyment,
luxury, beauty, education and duration of life, they are always fully God conscious. Such demigods are
always ready to render service to the Supreme Lord because they are perfectly aware of the fact that every
living entity is constitutionally an eternal subordinate servitor of the Lord. They also know that it is the
Lord only who can maintain all living entities with all the necessities of life. The Vedic hymns, eko
bahunam yo vidadhati kaman, ta enam abruvann ayatanam nah prajanihi yasmin pratisthita annam
adame, etc., confirm this truth. In Bhagavad-gita also, the Lord is mentioned as bhuta-bhrt, or the
maintainer of all living creatures.
The modern theory that starvation is due to an increase in population is not accepted by the demigods
or the devotees of the Lord. The devotees or demigods are fully aware that the Lord can maintain any
number of living entities, provided they are conscious of how to eat. If they want to eat like ordinary
animals, who have no God consciousness, then they must live in starvation, poverty and want, like the
jungle animals in the forest. The jungle animals are also maintained by the Lord with their respective
foodstuffs, but they are not advanced in God consciousness. Similarly, human beings are provided with
food grains, vegetables, fruits and milk by the grace of the Lord, but it is the duty of human beings to
acknowledge the mercy of the Lord. As a matter of gratitude, they should feel obliged to the Lord for their
supply of foodstuff, and they must first offer Him food in sacrifice and then partake of the remnants.
In Bhagavad-gita (3.13) it is confirmed that one who takes foodstuff after a performance of sacrifice eats
real food for proper maintenance of the body and soul, but one who cooks for himself and does not
perform any sacrifice eats only lumps of sin in the shape of foodstuffs. Such sinful eating can never make
one happy or free from scarcity. Famine is not due to an increase in population, as less intelligent
economists think. When human society is grateful to the Lord for all His gifts for the maintenance of the
living entities, then there is certainly no scarcity or want in society. But when men are unaware of the
intrinsic value of such gifts from the Lord, surely they are in want. A person who has no God
consciousness may live in opulence for the time being due to his past virtuous acts, but if one forgets his
relationship with the Lord, certainly he must await the stage of starvation by the law of the powerful
material nature. One cannot escape the vigilance of the powerful material nature unless he leads a God
conscious or devotional life.
