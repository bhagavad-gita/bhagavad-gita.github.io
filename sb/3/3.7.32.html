TRANSLATION
The means of livelihood of all persons, namely production of grains and their distribution to the prajas,
was generated from the thighs of the Lord's gigantic form. The mercantile men who take charge of such
execution are called vaisyas.
PURPORT
Human society's means of living is clearly mentioned here as visa, or agriculture and the business of
distributing agricultural products, which involves transport, banking, etc. Industry is an artificial means
of livelihood, and large-scale industry especially is the source of all the problems of society. In Bhagavadgita
also the duties of the vaisyas, who are engaged in visa, are stated as cow protection, agriculture and
business. We have already discussed that the human being can safely depend on the cow and agricultural
land for his livelihood.
The exchange of produce by banking and transportation is a branch of this type of living. The vaisyas
are divided into many subsections: some of them are called ksetri, or landowners, some are called krsana,
or land tillers, some of them are called tila-vanik, or grain raisers, some are called gandha-vanik, or
merchants in spices, and some are called suvarna-vanik, or merchants in gold and banking. The
brahmanas are the teachers and spiritual masters, the ksatriyas protect the citizens from the hands of
thieves and miscreants, and the vaisyas are in charge of production and distribution. The sudras, the
unintelligent class of men who cannot act independently in any of the above-mentioned activities, are
meant for serving the three higher classes for their livelihood.
Formerly, the brahmanas were given all the necessities of life by the ksatriyas and vaisyas because they
had no time to spend making a living. The ksatriyas would collect taxes from the vaisyas and sudras, but
the brahmanas were exempt from paying income tax or land revenue. That system of human society was
so nice that there were no political, social and economic upheavals. The different castes, or varna
classifications, are therefore essential for maintaining a peaceful human society.
