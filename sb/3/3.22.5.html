<h2>Text</h2>
tava sandarsanad eva
cchinna me sarva-samsayah
yat svayam bhagavan pritya
dharmam aha riraksisoh
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
tava--your; sandarsanat--by sight; eva--only; chinnah--resolved; me--my; sarva-samsayah--all doubts;
yat--inasmuch as; svayam--personally; bhagavan--Your Lordship; pritya--lovingly; dharmam--duty; aha--
explained; riraksisoh--of a king anxious to protect his subjects.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Now I have resolved all my doubts simply by meeting you, for Your Lordship has very kindly and
clearly explained the duty of a king who desires to protect his subjects.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Manu described herewith the result of seeing a great saintly person. Lord Caitanya says that one should
always try to associate with saintly persons because if one establishes a proper association with a saintly
person, even for a moment, one attains all perfection. Somehow or other, if one meets a saintly person and
achieves his favor, then the entire mission of one's human life is fulfilled. In our personal experience we
have actual proof of this statement of Manu. Once we had the opportunity to meet Visnupada Sri Srimad
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaja, and on first sight he requested this humble self to preach
his message in the Western countries. There was no preparation for this, but somehow or other he desired
it, and by his grace we are now engaged in executing his order, which has given us a transcendental
occupation and has saved and liberated us from the occupation of material activities. Thus it is actually a
fact that if one meets a saintly person completely engaged in transcendental duties and achieves his favor,
then one's life mission becomes complete. What is not possible to achieve in thousands of lives can be
achieved in one moment if there is an opportunity to meet a saintly person. It is therefore enjoined in
Vedic literature that one should always try to associate with saintly persons and try to disassociate oneself
from the common man, because by one word of a saintly person one can be liberated from material
entanglement. A saintly person has the power, because of his spiritual advancement, to give immediate
liberation to the conditioned soul. Here Manu admits that all his doubts are now over because Kardama
has very kindly described the different duties of individual souls.
