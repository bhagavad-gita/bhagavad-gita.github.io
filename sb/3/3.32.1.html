<h2>Translation</h2>
Sri Maitreya said: Thus Devahuti, the mother of Lord Kapila and wife of Kardama Muni, became freed
from all ignorance concerning devotional service and transcendental knowledge. She offered her
obeisances unto the Lord, the author of the basic principles of the Sankhya system of philosophy, which is
the background of liberation, and she satisfied Him with the following verses of prayer.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The system of philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila before His mother is the background for situation
on the spiritual platform. The specific significance of this system of philosophy is stated herein as siddhibhumim--
it is the background of salvation. People who are suffering in this material world because they
are conditioned by the material energy can easily get freedom from the clutches of matter by
understanding the Sankhya philosophy enunciated by Lord Kapila. By this system of philosophy, one can
immediately become free, even though one is situated in this material world. That stage is called jivanmukti.
This means that one is liberated even though one stays with his material body. That happened for
Devahuti, the mother of Lord Kapila, and she therefore satisfied the Lord by offering her prayers. Anyone
who understands the basic principle of Sankhya philosophy is elevated in devotional service and becomes
fully Krsna conscious, or liberated, even within this material world.
