<h2>Text</h2>
sa va esa tada drasta
napasyad drsyam ekarat
mene 'santam ivatmanam
supta-saktir asupta-drk
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
sah--the Personality of Godhead; va--either; esah--all these; tada--at that time; drasta--the seer; na--did
not; apasyat--see; drsyam--the cosmic creation; eka-rat--undisputed proprietor; mene--thought like this;
asantam--nonexistent; iva--like that; atmanam--plenary manifestations; supta--unmanifested; saktih--
material energy; asupta--manifested; drk--internal potency.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, the undisputed proprietor of everything, was the only seer. The cosmic manifestation was not
present at that time, and thus He felt imperfect without His plenary and separated parts and parcels. The
material energy was dormant, whereas the internal potency was manifested.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The Lord is the supreme seer because only by His glance did the material energy become active for
cosmic manifestation. At that time the seer was there, but the external energy, over which the glance of
the Lord is cast, was not present. He felt somewhat insufficient, like a husband feeling lonely in the
absence of his wife. This is a poetic simile. The Lord wanted to create the cosmic manifestation to give
another chance to the conditioned souls who were dormant in forgetfulness. The cosmic manifestation
gives the conditioned souls a chance to go back home, back to Godhead, and that is its main purpose. The
Lord is so kind that in the absence of such a manifestation He feels something wanting, and thus the
creation takes place. Although the creation of the internal potency was manifested, the other potency
appeared to be sleeping, and the Lord wanted to awaken her to activity, just as a husband wants to
awaken his wife from the sleeping state for enjoyment. It is the compassion of the Lord for the sleeping
energy that He wants to see her awaken for enjoyment like the other wives who are awake. The whole
process is to enliven the sleeping conditioned souls to the real life of spiritual consciousness so that they
may thus become as perfect as the ever-liberated souls in the Vaikunthalokas. Since the Lord is sac-cidananda-
vigraha, He likes every part and parcel of His different potencies to take part in the blissful rasa
because participation with the Lord in His eternal rasa-lila is the highest living condition, perfect in
spiritual bliss and eternal knowledge.
