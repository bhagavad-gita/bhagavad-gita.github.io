<h2>Translation</h2>
There were also many other temples of various forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Visnu,
established by great sages and demigods. These temples were marked with the chief emblems of the Lord,
and they reminded one always of the original Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
Human society is divided into four social orders of life and four spiritual divisions, applying to each and
every individual person. This system is called varnasrama-dharma and has already been discussed in many
places in this great literature. The sages, or persons who completely devoted themselves to the spiritual
upliftment of the entire human society, were known as dvija-deva, the best amongst the twice-born. The
denizens of superior planets, from the moon planet and upwards, were known as devas. Both the dvijadevas
and the devas always establish temples of Lord Visnu in His various forms, such as Govinda,
Madhusudana, Nrsimha, Madhava, Kesava, Narayana, Padmanabha, Partha-sarathi and many others. The
Lord expands Himself in innumerable forms, but all of them are nondifferent from one another. Lord
Visnu has four hands, and each hand holds a particular item--either a conchshell, wheel, club or lotus
flower. Of these four emblems, the cakra, or wheel, is the chief. Lord Krsna, being the original Visnu
form, has only one emblem, namely the wheel, and therefore He is sometimes called the Cakri. The Lord's
cakra is the symbol of the power by which the Lord controls the whole manifestation. The tops of Visnu
temples are marked with the symbol of the wheel so that people may have the chance to see the symbol
from a very long distance and at once remember Lord Krsna. The purpose of building very high temples is
to give people a chance to see them from a distant place. This system is carried on in India whenever a
new temple is constructed, and it appears that it is coming down from a time before recorded history. The
foolish propaganda by atheists that temples were constructed only in later days is refuted here because
Vidura visited these temples at least five thousand years ago, and the temples of Visnu were in existence
long, long before Vidura visited them. The great sages and demigods never established statues of men or
demigods, but they established temples of Visnu for the benefit of common men, to raise them to the
platform of God consciousness.
