TRANSLATION
The sages, headed by Sanaka Rsi, saw that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who was
formerly visible only within their hearts in ecstatic trance, had now actually become visible to their eyes.
As He came forward, accompanied by His own associates bearing all paraphernalia, such as an umbrella
and a camara fan, the white bunches of hair moved very gently, like two swans, and due to their favorable
breeze the pearls garlanding the umbrella also moved, like drops of nectar falling from the white full
moon or ice melting due to a gust of wind.
PURPORT
In this verse we find the word acaksataksa-visayam. The Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes,
but He now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumaras. Another significant word is samadhi-bhagyam.
Meditators who are very fortunate can see the Visnu form of the Lord within their hearts by following the
yogic process. But to see Him face to face is a different matter. This is only possible for pure devotees. The
Kumaras, therefore, upon seeing the Lord coming forward with His associates, who were holding an
umbrella and a camara fan, were struck with wonder that they were seeing the Lord face to face. It is said
in the Brahma-samhita that devotees, being elevated in love of God, always see Syamasundara, the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, within their hearts. But when they are mature, the same God is visible
before them face to face. For ordinary persons the Lord is not visible; however, when one can understand
the significance of His holy name and one engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord, beginning
with the tongue, by chanting and tasting prasada, then gradually the Lord reveals Himself. Thus the
devotee constantly sees the Lord within his heart, and, in a more mature stage, one can see the same Lord
directly, as we see everything else.
