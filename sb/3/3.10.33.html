TRANSLATION
When you are free from the conception of gross and subtle bodies and when your senses are free from
all influences of the modes of material nature, you will realize your pure form in My association. At that
time you will be situated in pure consciousness.
PURPORT
In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is said that a person whose only desire is to render transcendental
loving service to the Lord is a free person in any condition of material existence. That service attitude is
the svarupa, or real form, of the living entity. Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in the Caitanya-caritamrta,
also confirms this statement by declaring that the real, spiritual form of the living entity is eternal
servitorship to the Supreme Lord. The Mayavada school shudders at the thought of a service attitude in
the living entity, not knowing that in the transcendental world the service of the Lord is based on
transcendental love. Transcendental loving service is never to be compared to the forced service of the
material world. In the material world, even if one is under the conception that he is no one's servant, he is
still the servant of his senses, under the dictation of the material modes. Factually no one is master here in
the material world, and therefore the servants of the senses have a very bad experience of servitude. They
shudder at the thought of service because they have no knowledge of the transcendental position. In
transcendental loving service, the servitor is as free as the Lord. The Lord is svarat, or fully independent,
and the servant is also fully independent, or svarat, in the spiritual atmosphere because there is no forced
service. There the transcendental loving service is due to spontaneous love. A reflected glimpse of such
service is experienced in the service of the mother unto the son, the friend's service unto the friend, or the
wife's service unto the husband. These reflections of service by friends, parents or wives are not forced,
but are due only to love. Here in this material world, however, the loving service is only a reflection. The
real service, or service in svarupa, is present in the transcendental world, in association with the Lord.
The very same service in transcendental love can be practiced in devotion here.
This verse is also applicable to the jnani school. The enlightened jnani, when free from all material
contaminations, namely the gross and subtle bodies together with the senses of the material modes of
nature, is placed in the Supreme and is thus liberated from material bondage. The jnanis and the devotees
are actually in agreement up to the point of liberation from material contamination. But whereas the
jnanis remain pacified on the platform of simple understanding, the devotees develop further spiritual
advancement in loving service. The devotees develop a spiritual individuality in their spontaneous service
attitude, which is enhanced on and on, up to the point of madhurya-rasa, or transcendental loving service
reciprocated between the lover and the beloved.
