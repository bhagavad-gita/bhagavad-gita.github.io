<h2>Text</h2>
dvi-parardhavasane yah
pralayo brahmanas tu te
tavad adhyasate lokam
parasya para-cintakah
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
dvi-parardha--two parardhas; avasane--at the end of; yah--which; pralayah--death; brahmanah--of Lord
Brahma; tu--indeed; te--they; tavat--so long; adhyasate--dwell; lokam--on the planet; parasya--of the
Supreme; para-cintakah--thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
Worshipers of the Hiranyagarbha expansion of the Personality of Godhead remain within this material
world until the end of two parardhas, when Lord Brahma also dies.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
One dissolution is at the end of Brahma's day, and one is at the end of Brahma's life. Brahma dies at the
end of two parardhas, at which time the entire material universe is dissolved. Persons who are worshipers
of Hiranyagarbha, the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Garbhodakasayi Visnu,
do not directly approach the Supreme personality of Godhead in Vaikuntha. They remain within this
universe on Satyaloka or other higher planets until the end of the life of Brahma. Then, with Brahma, they
are elevated to the spiritual kingdom.
The words parasya para-cintakah mean "always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead," or
being always Krsna conscious. When we speak of Krsna, this refers to the complete category of visnutattva.
Krsna includes the three purusa incarnations, namely Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and
Ksirodakasayi Visnu, as well as all the incarnations taken together. This is confirmed in the Brahmasamhita.
Ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan: Lord Krsna is perpetually situated with His many
expansions, such as Rama, Nrsimha, Vamana, Madhusudana, Visnu and Narayana. He exists with all His
plenary portions and the portions of His plenary portions, and each of them is as good as the Supreme
personality of Godhead. The words parasya para-cintakah mean those who are fully Krsna conscious.
Such persons enter directly into the kingdom of God, the Vaikuntha planets, or, if they are worshipers of
the plenary portion Garbhodakasayi Visnu, they remain within this universe until its dissolution, and
after that they enter.
