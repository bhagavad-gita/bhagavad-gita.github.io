<h2>Translation</h2>
Engagement in Krsna consciousness and application of devotional service unto Krsna make it possible
to advance in knowledge and detachment, as well as in self-realization.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
It is said by less intelligent men that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service, is meant for persons who are not
advanced in transcendental knowledge and renunciation. But the fact is that if one engages in the
devotional service of the Lord in full Krsna consciousness, he does not have to attempt separately to
practice detachment or to wait for an awakening of transcendental knowledge. It is said that one who
engages unflinchingly in the devotional service of the Lord actually has all the good qualities of the
demigods develop in him automatically. One cannot discover how such good qualities develop in the
body of a devotee, but actually it happens. There is one instance where a hunter was taking pleasure in
killing animals, but after becoming a devotee he was not prepared to kill even an ant. Such is the quality
of a devotee.
Those who are very eager to advance in transcendental knowledge can engage themselves in pure
devotional service, without wasting time in mental speculation. For arriving at the positive conclusions of
knowledge in the Absolute Truth, the word brahma-darsanam is significant in this verse. Brahmadarsanam
means to realize or to understand the Transcendence. One who engages in the service of
Vasudeva can actually realize what Brahman is. If Brahman is impersonal, then there is no question of
darsanam, which means "seeing face to face." Darsanam refers to seeing the Supreme personality of
Godhead, Vasudeva. Unless the seer and the seen are persons, there is no darsanam. Brahma-darsanam
means that as soon as one sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can at once realize what
impersonal Brahman is. A devotee does not need to make separate investigations to understand the nature
of Brahman. Bhagavad-gita also confirms this. Brahma-bhuyaya kalpate: a devotee at once becomes a selfrealized
soul in the Absolute Truth.
