<h2>Text</h2>
bhagavams tu gada-vegam
visrstam ripunorasi
avancayat tirascino
yogarudha ivantakam
<p></p>
<h2>Synonyms</h2>
bhagavan--the Lord; tu--however; gada-vegam--the blow of the mace; visrstam--thrown; ripuna--by the
enemy; urasi--at His breast; avancayat--dodged; tirascinah--aside; yoga-arudhah--an accomplished yogi;
iva--like; antakam--death.
<p></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
The Lord, however, by moving slightly aside, dodged the violent mace-blow aimed at His breast by the
enemy, just as an accomplished yogi would elude death.
<p></p>
<h2>Purport</h2>
The example is given herein that the perfect yogi can overcome a deathblow although it is offered by the
laws of nature. It is useless for a demon to beat the transcendental body of the Lord with a powerful mace,
for no one can surpass His prowess. Those who are advanced transcendentalists are freed from the laws of
nature, and even a deathblow cannot act on them. Superficially it may be seen that a yogi is attacked by a
deathblow, but by the grace of the Lord he can overcome many such attacks for the service of the Lord. As
the Lord exists by His own independent prowess, by the grace of the Lord the devotees also exist for His
service.
