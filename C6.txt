CHAPTER SIX Sankhya-yoga

TEXT 6.1
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work.

TEXT 6.2
TRANSLATION
What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.

TEXT 6.3
TRANSLATION
For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means.

TEXT 6.4
TRANSLATION
A person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.

TEXT 6.5
TRANSLATION
A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.

TEXT 6.6
TRANSLATION
For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy.

TEXT 6.7
TRANSLATION
For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, \nhonor and dishonor are all the same.

TEXT 6.8
TRANSLATION
A person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yog\xe2\x80\x9d [or mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled. He sees everything\xc3\x91whether it be pebbles, stones or gold\xc3\x91as the same.

TEXT 6.9
TRANSLATION
A person is said to be still further advanced when he regards all\xc3\x91the honest well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those \nwho are indifferent and impartial\xc3\x91with an equal mind.

TEXT 6.10
TRANSLATION
A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.

TEXTS 6.11
TRANSLATION
To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay ku\xe2\x80\x9ca-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The \nyog\xe2\x80\x9d should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.

TEXTS 6.13-14
TRANSLATION
One should hold one\xc3\x95s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the \nheart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.

TEXT 6.15
TRANSLATION
Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] by \ncessation of material existence.

TEXT 6.16
TRANSLATION
There is no possibility of one\xc3\x95s becoming a yog\xe2\x80\x9d, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.

TEXT 6.17
TRANSLATION
He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.'


TEXT 6.18
TRANSLATION
When the yog\xe2\x80\x9d, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in Transcendence\xc3\x91devoid of all material desires\xc3\x91he is said to have \nattained yoga.

TEXT 6.19
TRANSLATION
As a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent \nSelf.'

TEXTS 6.20-23
TRANSLATION
The stage of perfection is called trance, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi, when one\xc3\x95s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This is \ncharacterized by one\xc3\x95s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. \nEstablished thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he \nthinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.

TEXT 6.24
TRANSLATION
One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.

TEXT 6.25
TRANSLATION
Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self \nalone and should think of nothing else.'

TEXT 6.26
TRANSLATION
From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.

TEXT 6.27
TRANSLATION
The yog\xe2\x80\x9d whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest happiness. By virtue of his identity with Brahman, he is liberated; his mind is peaceful, his passions are quieted, and he is freed from sin.
the Lord, or to remain in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is to be factually liberated from the mode of passion and all material contamination.

TEXT 6.28
TRANSLATION
Steady in the Self, being freed from all material contamination, the yog\xe2\x80\x9d achieves the highest perfectional stage of happiness in touch with the Supreme Consciousness.

TEXT 6.29
TRANSLATION
A true yog\xe2\x80\x9d observes Me in all beings, and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized man sees Me everywhere.

TEXT 6.30
TRANSLATION
For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.

TEXT 6.31
TRANSLATION
The yog\xe2\x80\x9d who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.
"Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading. By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere. As the sun, He appears in many places at once."

TEXT 6.32
TRANSLATION
He is a perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!

TEXT 6.33
TRANSLATION
appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.

TEXT 6.34
TRANSLATION
For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.

TEXT 6.35
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by \ndetachment.

TEXT 6.36
TRANSLATION
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success. That is My opinion.'

TEXT 6.37
TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who '
later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?

TEXT 6.38
TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, does not such a man, being deviated from the path of Transcendence, perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?

TEXT 6.39
TRANSLATION
This is my doubt O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.

TEXT 6.40
TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual \nworld; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.

TEXT 6.41
TRANSLATION
The unsuccessful yog\xe2\x80\x9d, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a \nfamily of rich aristocracy.'

TEXT 6.42
TRANSLATION
Or he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in wisdom. Verily, such a birth is rare in this world.'

TEXT 6.43
TRANSLATION
On taking such a birth, he again revives the divine consciousness of his previous life, and he tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete success, O son of Kuru.'

TEXT 6.44
TRANSLATION
By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles\xc3\x91even without seeking them. Such an inquisitive transcendentalist, striving for yoga, stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures.'

TEXT 6.45
TRANSLATION
But when the yog\xe2\x80\x9d engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal.

TEXT 6.46
TRANSLATION
A yog\xe2\x80\x9d is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yog\xe2\x80\x9d.

TEXT 6.47
TRANSLATION
And of all yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.
