CHAPTER SEVEN Knowledge of the Absolute

TEXT 7.1
TRANSLATION
Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.

TEXT 7.2
TRANSLATION
I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge both phenomenal and noumenal, by knowing which there shall remain nothing further to be known.

TEXT 7.3
TRANSLATION
Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.

TEXT 7.4
TRANSLATION
Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies.

TEXT 7.5
TRANSLATION
Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.

TEXT 7.6
TRANSLATION
Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both its origin and dissolution.

TEXT 7.7
TRANSLATION
O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.

TEXT 7.8
TRANSLATION
O son of Kunti [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.

TEXT 7.9
TRANSLATION
I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the heat in fire. I am the life of all that lives, and I am the penances of all ascetics.

TEXT 7.10
TRANSLATION
O son of Prtha, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.

TEXT 7.11
TRANSLATION
I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bharatas [Arjuna].

TEXT 7.12
TRANSLATION
All states of being--be they of goodness, passion or ignorance--are manifested by My energy. I am, in one sense, everything--but I am independant. I am not under the modes of this material nature.

TEXT 7.13
TRANSLATION
Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world does not know Me who am above the modes and inexhaustible.

TEXT 7.14
TRANSLATION
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.

TEXT 7.15
TRANSLATION
Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.

TEXT 7.16
TRANSLATION
O best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.

TEXT 7.17
TRANSLATION
Of these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.

TEXT 7.18
TRANSLATION
All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My transcendental service, he attains Me.

TEXT 7.19
TRANSLATION
After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.

TEXT 7.20
TRANSLATION
Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.
are not so much attracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all material lust. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is recommended that whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee and has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases surrender to V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual \nsense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore \nworship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not \nmisguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping \ndifferent gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows \nthat the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the master of all. In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is master and all others \nare servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of \nhis material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is \nsatisfied with whatever He gives.

TEXT 7.21
TRANSLATION
I am in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some particular deity.

TEXT 7.22
TRANSLATION
Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.

TEXT 7.23
TRANSLATION
Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.

TEXT 7.24
TRANSLATION
Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, \nwhich is changeless and supreme.'

TEXT 7.25
TRANSLATION
I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.

TEXT 7.26
TRANSLATION
O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are \nyet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.

TEXT 7.27
TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conquerer of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.

TEXT 7.28
TRANSLATION
Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.

TEXT 7.29
TRANSLATION
Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities.'

TEXT 7.30
TRANSLATION
Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods \nand as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and know Me even at the time of death.
