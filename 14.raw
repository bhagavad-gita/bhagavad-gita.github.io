TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection.
PURPORTFrom the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed \nfrom material entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attain perfection and \ntransfer to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attain perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.

TRANSLATION
By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.
PURPORTAfter acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental \nloving service. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of the Supreme Person. Those who have no \nknowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere \nis said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual '
qualities. One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.
PURPORTThis is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of k\xc5\x92etra and k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a, the body and the spirit soul. This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: \nj\xe2\x88\x92yate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, '
fire and air, are all material energy, called Mah\xe2\x88\x92-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature\xc3\x91the living entity. In material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not \nthe cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.

TRANSLATION
It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.'

PURPORTIn this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s seed-giving \nprocess. The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated in the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to their past deeds.

TRANSLATION
Material nature consists of the three modes\xc3\x91goodness, passion and ignorance. When the living entity comes in contact with nature, he becomes conditioned by these modes.
PURPORTThe living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the material '
world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.

TRANSLATION
O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that \nmode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.
PURPORTThe living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities\xc3\x95 conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not '
so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge \nand is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to \ntake some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.

TRANSLATION
The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.
PURPORTThe mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with \nthe fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.
PURPORTIn this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in \nthe Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to \nassociate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.'

TRANSLATION
The mode of goodness conditions one to happiness, passion conditions him to the fruits of action, and ignorance to madness.
PURPORTA person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open \nhospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are the signs of one in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance, whatever one does is neither good for him nor for anyone.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode of goodness, O son of Bharata. And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats \npassion, and at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion. \nIn this way there is always competition for supremacy.
PURPORTWhen the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and ignorance are defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are defeated. And, when the mode of ignorance is prominent, passion and goodness are defeated. This competition is always going on. Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has to transcend these three modes. The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one\xc3\x95s dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc. All this \nwill be explained in later chapters. But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or, one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated in pure goodness, \nwhich is called the v\xe2\x88\x92sudeva state, a state in which one can understand the '

The manifestations of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge.
PURPORTThere are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the genital and the anus. In every gate, when the symptom of goodness is illuminated, it should be understood that one has developed the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the right position, one can hear things in the right position, and one can taste things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is the position of \ngoodness.

If he wants to construct a residential house, he tries his best to have a palatial house, as if he would be able to reside in that house eternally. And he develops a great hankering for sense gratification. There is no end to sense gratification. He always wants to \nremain with his family and in his house and to continue the process of sense gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion.

When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when he dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom.
PURPORTSome people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of human life, it never goes down again. This is incorrect. According to this verse, if one develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is degraded to '
the animal form of life. From there one has to again elevate himself, by evolutionary process, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore, those who are actually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in good association transcend the modes and become situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. This is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human being will again attain to the human status.

TRANSLATION
By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode of passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness.
PURPORTBy pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass \nof wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render '
physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness\xc3\x91\xc3\x92I have this house or this money\xc3\x93\xc3\x91but this is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor \nanimals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\xc3\x95s being killed. One has to pay for it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the \ntongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhi\xc5\xa1 pr\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9aita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully \nsatisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:namo brahma\xe2\x80\x9aya-dev\xe2\x88\x92ya go-br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa-hit\xe2\x88\x92ya cajagaddhit\xe2\x88\x92ya k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92ya govind\xe2\x88\x92ya namo nama\xc5\xa1.\xc3\x92My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.\xc3\x93 The purport is that special \nmention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. Br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the cows, must be given all protection\xc3\x91that is real advancement of \ncivilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is \nadvancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own '
condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.

TRANSLATION
From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and \nillusion develop.
PURPORTSince the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is recommended. Through K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example, \nthey do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being '
killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren\xc3\x95t happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the \npossibility for peace and prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he \nhas to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark.

TRANSLATION
Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.
PURPORTIn this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can \nbring us to this.The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of \nbecoming mad in the next life.The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions. The word t\xe2\x88\x92mas\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 is very significant here. T\xe2\x88\x92mas\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 indicates those who stay \ncontinually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their future is very dark.'
There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue in the lower modes.

TRANSLATION
When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can know My spiritual nature.
PURPORTOne can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real spiritual master is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one\xc3\x95s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the \nmaterial modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but '
when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become fixed in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is \nnot controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.

TRANSLATION
When the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes, he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy nectar \neven in this life.'

PURPORTHow one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word deh\xe2\x80\x9d means embodied. Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement, and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who is transcendental to those modes? What is his behavior? And how does he \ntranscend the modes of nature?'

PURPORTIn this verse, Arjuna\xc3\x95s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature. That is very important. \nUnless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is \nseated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active; who regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a \npiece of gold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same; who is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings\xc3\x91such a man is said to have \ntranscended the modes of nature.'

PURPORTArjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another. In these verses, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of \nthe material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is \naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by \nsuch false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do \nwith material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but for his personal self he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.'

TRANSLATION
One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.
PURPORTThis verse is a reply to Arjuna\xc3\x95s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa activities. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa activities are known as bhakti-yoga\xc3\x91always acting for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This includes not only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but His different plenary expansions such as R\xe2\x88\x92ma and N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in \nthe service of any of the forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they '
possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the \nSupreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity\xc3\x95s spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity \nof exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahm\xe2\x88\x92pyeti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. \nThis means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as \nindividual soul.

TRANSLATION
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.
PURPORTThe constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate \nrealization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates \nhimself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \nThere are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\xe2\x88\x92ras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite \nof being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if '
one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai sa\xc5\xa1; rasa\xe2\x80\xb9 hy ev\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\xb9 labdhv\xe2\x88\x92nand\xe2\x80\x9d bhavati. \xc3\x92When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he \nactually becomes transcendentally blissful.\xc3\x93 The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, \nor imperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of \nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering!the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service!should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the \nspiritual master, one\xc3\x95s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord\xc3\x95s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the \nLord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ana, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.'
