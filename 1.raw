Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra said: O Sa\xc5\x81jaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, what did my sons and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u do, being desirous to fight?
b'want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship!even for the denizens of heaven!Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra became very \nfearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\xc5\x81jaya was a student of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, Sa\xc5\x81jaya was able to envision the \nBattlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra even while he was in the room of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. And so, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.Both the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas and the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra belong to the same family, but Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants \nare taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra where the father of religion, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\xc5\x92etre and kuru-k\xc5\x92etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma. On the other hand, the forces of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma. \nDuryodhana was always envious of Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained.

TRANSLATION
Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.
PURPORTDuryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He emphasized that Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes would not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the \nphalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva. He was confident of the full support of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva and Dro\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna\xc3\x95s wife Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, he hoped that all \nsuch affection would now be completely given up by them, as was customary during the gambling performances.'

Then Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.
PURPORTThe grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection.

On the other side, both Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.'

PURPORTIn contrast with the conchshell blown by Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva, the conchshells in the hands of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was on the side of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas.

Victory is always with persons like \nthe sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u because Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because \nthe goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds.

Then, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa blew His conchshell, called P\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Pau\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8ram.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is referred to as H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca in this verse because He is the owner of all senses The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their \nsenses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca. The Lord has different names because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva \nbecause He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\xe2\x80\x9d-nandana because He accepted Devak\xe2\x80\x9d as His mother; His name is Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92 at V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana; His name is P\xe2\x88\x92rtha-s\xe2\x88\x92rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra.Arjuna is referred to as Dhana\xc5\x81jaya in this verse because he helped his elder \nbrother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma is known as V\xe2\x80\x9ekodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\xc5\xb8imba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, beginning with the Lord\xc3\x95s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme \ndirector, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose '
b'the battle!and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.

TRANSLATION
O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, who was seated in his chariot, his flag marked with Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his \narrows, looking at the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] these words:
PURPORTThe battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra were more or less disheartened by the '
b'unexpected arrangement of military force by the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa on the battlefield. The emblem of Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n cooperated with Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma in the battle between R\xe2\x88\x92ma and R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa, and Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma emerged victorious. Now both R\xe2\x88\x92ma and Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is R\xe2\x88\x92ma Himself, and wherever Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma is, His eternal servitor Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n and His eternal consort S\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any \nenemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I must contend in this great battle attempt.
PURPORTAlthough Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and \nHis servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee\xc3\x95s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the \ninfallible master of all circumstances.As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they \nwere bent upon demanding an unwanted war.'

Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.
PURPORTIt was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of \nproposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was sitting by his side.

TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.
PURPORTIn this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca. Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ka means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As a great devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he could not forget K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can conquer both sleep and \nignorance simply by thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa constantly. This is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. As H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could understand Arjuna\xc3\x95s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.

In the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa and all other chieftains of the world, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord, said, Just behold, P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, all the Kurus who are assembled here.
PURPORTAs the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, or the son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d or P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a \nfriend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa mean when He told Arjuna to \xc3\x92behold the Kurus\xc3\x93? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa never expected such things from the son of His aunt P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly joking.

Arjuna said: My dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth \ndrying up.'
b'
PURPORTAny man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he \nfelt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\xc3\x95s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was \nalso crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:yasy\xe2\x88\x92sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\xc5\x81can\xe2\x88\x92sarvair gu\xe2\x80\x9aais tatra sam\xe2\x88\x92sate sur\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1har\xe2\x88\x92v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92mano-rathen\xe2\x88\x92sati dh\xe2\x88\x92vato bahi\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 5.18.12)

PURPORTThere are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna\xc3\x95s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear\xc3\x91namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow G\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9dva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.

I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I foresee only evil, O killer of the Ke\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d demon.
PURPORTDue to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind. Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhaya\xe2\x80\xb9 dvit\xe2\x80\x9dy\xe2\x88\x92bhinive\xe2\x80\x9cata\xc5\xa1: such fearfulness and loss of mental \nequilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battlefield\xc3\x91he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, \xc3\x92Why am I here?\xc3\x93 Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is everyone\xc3\x95s real self-interest. \nThe conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.

I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.
PURPORTWithout knowing that one\xc3\x95s self-interest is in Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au (or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. Under delusion, they forget that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is also the cause of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a k\xc5\x92atriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the k\xc5\x92atriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s personal orders and the \nperson in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a k\xc5\x92atriya, he requires a kingdom for \nhis subsistence, because the k\xc5\x92atriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna\xc3\x95s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

TRANSLATION
O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
PURPORTArjuna has addressed Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Govinda because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way\xc3\x91namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda \nwithout desiring to satisfy one\xc3\x95s own senses\xc3\x91then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\xc3\x95s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his '
b'opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.

TRANSLATION
Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra and our friends. What should we gain, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our \nown kinsmen?
PURPORTAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\xc3\x95s land, and \n6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\xc5\x92atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he \nshould not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma was so saintly that people \nwere anxious to live in His kingdom, (R\xe2\x88\x92ma-r\xe2\x88\x92jya), but Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma never showed any cowardice. R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa was an aggressor against R\xe2\x88\x92ma because he kidnapped R\xe2\x88\x92ma\xc3\x95s wife, S\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, but Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\xc3\x95s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides \nthat, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his \nown kinsmen? Arjuna\xc3\x95s addressing of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as \xc3\x92M\xe2\x88\x92dhava,\xc3\x93 or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not '
b'have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

O Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one\xc3\x95s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the \nsin, engage in these acts?'
b'
PURPORTA k\xc5\x92atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party. Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight because he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this connection, Arjuna considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a challenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept the challenge. Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound. \nConsidering all these pros and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.

With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice.
PURPORTIn the system of the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution there are many principles of religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values. The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the '
b'remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose should the elder members of the family be slain.

PURPORTGood population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama religion\xc3\x95s principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the \ngeneral spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to C\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aakya Pa\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8it, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of '
b'religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama system. On the failure of such var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.

TRANSLATION
When there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is created both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. In such \ncorrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the ancestors.
PURPORTAccording to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, because eating the remnants of food offered to Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes '
b'the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of pras\xe2\x88\x92dam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released \nfrom ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can \ndeliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery.

PURPORTArjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablution before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablution called the \npr\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9ccitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities.

PURPORTDriven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of one\xc3\x95s own brother, father, or mother. There are many such instances in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is '
b'always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities.

TRANSLATION
I would consider it better for the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra to kill me unarmed and unresisting, rather than fight with them.
PURPORTIt is the custom\xc3\x91according to k\xc5\x92atriya fighting principles\xc3\x91that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked by the enemy. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to softheartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.'

TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.
PURPORTWhile observing the situation of his enemy, Arjuna stood up on the chariot, but he was so afflicted with lamentation that he sat down again, setting aside his bow and arrows. Such a kind and softhearted person, in the devotional service of the Lord, is fit to receive self-knowledge.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the First Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra.'
