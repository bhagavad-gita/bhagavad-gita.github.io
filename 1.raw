CHAPTER ONE Observing the Armies on theBattlefield of Kuruk!etra 


TEXT 1

Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra said: O Sa\xc5\x81jaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, what did my sons and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u do, being desirous to fight?
want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship!even for the denizens of heaven!Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra became very \nfearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\xc5\x81jaya was a student of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, Sa\xc5\x81jaya was able to envision the \nBattlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra even while he was in the room of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. And so, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.Both the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas and the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra belong to the same family, but Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants \nare taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra where the father of religion, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\xc5\x92etre and kuru-k\xc5\x92etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

TEXT 2

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following \nwords:

TEXT 3

O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.

TEXT 4

Here in this army there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma and Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudh\xe2\x88\x92na, Vir\xe2\x88\x92\xc4\xb1a and Drupada.

TEXT 5

There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dh\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1aketu, Cekit\xe2\x88\x92na, K\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cir\xe2\x88\x92ja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and \xe2\x80\xa1aibya.

TEXT 6

There are the mighty Yudh\xe2\x88\x92manyu, the very powerful Uttamauj\xe2\x88\x92, the son of Subhadr\xe2\x88\x92 and the sons of Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d. All these warriors are great chariot fighters.

TEXT 7

O best of the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, for your information, let me tell you about the captains who are especially qualified to lead my military force.

TEXT 8

There are personalities like yourself, Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9epa, A\xe2\x80\x9cvatth\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92, Vikar\xe2\x80\x9aa and the son of Somadatta called Bhuri\xe2\x80\x9crav\xe2\x88\x92, who are always victorious in battle.
before her marriage with King P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u. K\xe2\x80\x9ep\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya married the twin sister of Dro\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya.

TEXT 9

There are many other heroes who are prepared to lay down their lives for my sake. All of them are well equipped with different kinds of weapons, and all are experienced in military science.

TEXT 10

Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, whereas the strength of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, carefully protected by Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, is \nlimited.

TEXT 11

Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.

TEXT 12

Then Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.

TEXT 13

After that, the conchshells, bugles, trumpets, drums and horns were all suddenly sounded, and the combined sound was tumultuous.

TEXT 14

On the other side, both Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.'

TEXT 15

Then, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa blew His conchshell, called P\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Pau\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8ram.

TEXTS 16

King Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, the son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, blew his conchshell, the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva blew the Sugho\xc5\x92a and Ma\xe2\x80\x9aipu\xc5\x92paka. That great archer the King of K\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d, the great fighter \xe2\x80\xa1ikha\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9d, Dh\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1adyumna, Vir\xe2\x88\x92\xc4\xb1a and the \nunconquerable S\xe2\x88\x92tyaki, Drupada, the sons of Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d, and the others, O King, \nsuch as the son of Subhadr\xe2\x88\x92, greatly armed, all blew their respective conchshells.'

TEXT 19

The blowing of these different conchshells became uproarious, and thus, vibrating both in the sky and on the earth, it shattered the hearts of the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.

TEXT 20

O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, who was seated in his chariot, his flag marked with Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his \narrows, looking at the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] these words:

TEXTS 21
yoddhavyam\xc3\x91to fight with; asmin\xc3\x91in this; ra\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91strife; samudyame\xc3\x91in the attempt.

Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I must contend in this great battle attempt.

TEXT 23

Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.

TEXT 24

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.

TEXT 25

In the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa and all other chieftains of the world, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord, said, Just behold, P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, all the Kurus who are assembled here.

TEXT 26

There Arjuna could see, within the midst of the armies of both parties, his fathers, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, friends, and also his father-in-law and well-wishers\xc3\x91all present there.

TEXT 27

When the son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, Arjuna, saw all these different grades of friends and relatives, he became overwhelmed with compassion and spoke thus:

TEXT 28

Arjuna said: My dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth \ndrying up.'

TEXT 29

My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end. My bow G\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9dva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.

TEXT 30
also; pa\xe2\x80\x9cy\xe2\x88\x92mi\xc3\x91I foresee; vipar\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92ni\xc3\x91just the opposite; ke\xe2\x80\x9cava\xc3\x91O killer of the demon Ke\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa).

I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I foresee only evil, O killer of the Ke\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d demon.

TEXT 31

I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.

TEXTS 32

O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.

TEXT 36

Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra and our friends. What should we gain, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our \nown kinsmen?

TEXTS 37

O Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one\xc3\x95s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the \nsin, engage in these acts?'

TEXT 39

With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice.

TEXT 40

When irreligion is prominent in the family, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of \nV\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai, comes unwanted progeny.

TEXT 41

When there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is created both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. In such \ncorrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the ancestors.

TEXT 42

Due to the evil deeds of the destroyers of family tradition, all kinds of community projects and family welfare activities are devastated.

TEXT 43

O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, maintainer of the people, I have heard by disciplic succession that those who destroy family traditions dwell always in hell.'

TEXT 44

Alas, how strange it is that we are preparing to commit greatly sinful acts, driven by the desire to enjoy royal happiness.
always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities.

TEXT 45

I would consider it better for the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra to kill me unarmed and unresisting, rather than fight with them.

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: Arjuna, having thus spoken on the battlefield, cast aside his bow and arrows and sat down on the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with grief.
