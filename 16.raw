TEXTS 1-3

The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one\xc3\x95s existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and \nfreedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; \nvigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor\xc3\x91these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.'

TEXT 4

Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance\xc3\x91these qualities belong to those of demonic nature, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92.

TEXT 5

The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, for you are born \nwith the divine qualities.

TEXT 6

O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demonic. I have already explained to you at \nlength the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.

TEXT 7

Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.

TEXT 8

They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.'


TEXT 9

Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

TEXT 10

The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the \nimpermanent.

TEXTS 11

They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure \nmoney by illegal means for sense gratification.

TEXTS 13

The demoniac person thinks: \xc3\x92So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the \nfuture, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other '
enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.\xc3\x93 In this way, such \npersons are deluded by ignorance.

TEXT 16

Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.

TEXT 17

Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations.

TEXT 18

Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.
advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.

TEXT 19

Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.

TEXT 20

Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.

TEXT 21

There are three gates leading to this hell\xc3\x91lust, anger, and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.

TEXT 22

The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.

TEXT 23

But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.

TEXT 24

One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he \nmay gradually be elevated.'
