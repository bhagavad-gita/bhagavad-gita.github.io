The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.

Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.

TEXT 10.3

He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds\xc3\x91he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.'

TEXTS 10.4

Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear, \nfearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy are created by Me alone.

TEXT 10.6

The seven great sages and before them the four other great sages and the Manus [progenitors of mankind] are born out of My mind, and all creatures in these \nplanets descend from them.'

TEXT 10.7

He who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine engages in unalloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt.

TEXT 10.8

I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and \nworship Me with all their hearts.

TEXT 10.14

O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor demons, O Lord, know Thy personality.

Please tell me in detail of Your divine powers by which You pervade all these worlds and abide in them.

TEXT 10.17

How should I meditate on You? In what various forms are You to be contemplated, O Blessed Lord?
materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested by physical representations.
