Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.
PURPORTThis chapter reveals K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of the Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and from Him the material universes emanate. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order \nto establish K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s divinity for all, he is requesting K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says several times. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s grace. He is now convinced that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\xc3\x95s \nheart as the Supersoul.

TRANSLATION
O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.
PURPORTArjuna addresses Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as \xc3\x92lotus-eyed\xc3\x93 (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa which Arjuna \nadmits that he has thoroughly understood.

TRANSLATION
O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.
PURPORTThe Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart \nfrom it. Arjuna\xc3\x95s asking the Lord\xc3\x95s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also \nunderstands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.

TRANSLATION
If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.
PURPORTIt is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s inestimable position. Arjuna could \nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word yoge\xe2\x80\x9cvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is \nunlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He does not give K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa orders. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, behold now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.
PURPORTArjuna wanted to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form \nof K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in this way, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa must give one the power to see it.

PURPORTEven though Arjuna was a personal friend of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the most advanced of learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Here it is stated that humans have neither heard nor known of all these forms and manifestations. Now K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa reveals these wonderful forms.

Whatever you wish to see can be seen all at once in this body. This universal form can show you all that you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in the future. Everything is here completely.
PURPORTNo one can see the entire universe sitting in one place. Even the most advanced scientist cannot see what is going on in other parts of the universe. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gives him the power to see anything he wants to see, past, present and future. Thus by the mercy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Arjuna is able to see everything.

TRANSLATION
But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.
PURPORTA pure devotee does not like to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Arjuna is told '
b'not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not very important; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the friends of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the parents of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa never want K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Lord. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such boys do not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. The Supreme Person is \nconsidered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s statement so that in the future people could understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this \nbecause Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system. Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already \nexplained.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many \nscents smeared over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. \nThis was seen by Arjuna.
PURPORTThese two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs, etc., of the Lord. These manifestations are distributed throughout the universe and are unlimited. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see them while sitting in one place. That is due to the inconceivable potency of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.
PURPORTWhat Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Sa\xc5\x81jaya is trying to give a mental picture of that great revelation to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. Neither Sa\xc5\x81jaya nor Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra were present, but Sa\xc5\x81jaya, by the grace of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, could see whatever happened. Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).

TRANSLATION
At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.
PURPORTThe word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others '
b'on the battlefield could not see this form because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gave the vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa many thousands of universes. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these universes. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.
PURPORTOnce the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna changes immediately. Before, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna\xc3\x95s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the reservoir of all '
b'relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was \naffected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.

Arjuna said: My dear Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, I see assembled together in Your body all the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 sitting on the lotus flower as well as Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and many sages and divine serpents.
PURPORTArjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au lies in the lower regions of the universe. This snake bed is called V\xe2\x88\x92suki. There are also other snakes known as V\xe2\x88\x92suki. Arjuna can see from the Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first creature of the universe, resides. \nThat means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot. This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

Although You are one, You are spread throughout the sky and the planets and all space between. O great one, as I behold this terrible form, I see that all the planetary systems are perplexed.
PURPORTDy\xe2\x88\x92v \xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x80\x9ethivyo\xc5\xa1 (the space between heaven and earth) and lokatrayam (three worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were spiritually awake with the divine vision saw it.

PURPORTIn a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would by very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite party (Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa and all the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra) and their soldiers and Arjuna\xc3\x95s own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses on both sides. It is also mentioned here that Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you [the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas], all the soldiers \nhere on both sides will be slain.
PURPORTAlthough Arjuna knew that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92. Yasya brahme ca k\xc5\x92atram ca ubhe bhavata odana\xc5\xa1/m\xe2\x80\x9etyur yasyopasecana\xe2\x80\xb9 ka itth\xe2\x88\x92 veda yatra sa\xc5\xa1. Eventually all the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, k\xc5\x92atriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme. This \nform of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him.Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, \neven if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

TRANSLATION
Therefore get up and prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyas\xe2\x88\x92cin, can be but an instmment in the fight.
PURPORTSavyas\xe2\x88\x92cin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies. \xc3\x92Just become an instrument\xc3\x93: nimitta-m\xe2\x88\x92tram. This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the \nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \xc3\x92perhaps\xc3\x93 and \xc3\x92maybe.\xc3\x93 There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have \nthe domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one '
b'is in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is perfect.

O H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You \ntheir respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All \nthis is rightly done.
PURPORTArjuna, after hearing from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything done by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher \nplanets, and they were observing the fight because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.'

TRANSLATION
O great one, who stands above even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, You are the original master. Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the \nuniverse, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.
PURPORTBy this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the \ninfluence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\xe2\x80\x9ca means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him because no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is greater than Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 because Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is created by Him. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, who '
b'is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s plenary expansion; therefore Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva, who is born of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is respected by Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and similar other demigods. The word ak\xc5\x92aram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme.

TRANSLATION
You are the original Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You know everything, and You are all that is \nknowable. You are above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole \ncosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!
PURPORTEverything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the ultimate rest. Nidh\xe2\x88\x92nam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is the '
b'knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the transcendental world.

You are air, fire, water, and You are the moon! You are the supreme controller and the grandfather. Thus I offer my respectful obeisances unto You a thousand times, and again and yet again!
PURPORTThe Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive. Arjuna also addresses K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the grandfather because He is the father of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first living creature in the universe.'

Obeisances from the front, from behind and from all sides! O unbounded power, You are the master of limitless, might! You are all-pervading, and thus You are \neverything!

TRANSLATION
I have in the past addressed You as \xc3\x92O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O Y\xe2\x88\x92dava,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O my friend,\xc3\x93 without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes alone and sometimes in \nfront of many friends. Please excuse me for all my offenses.
PURPORTAlthough K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise '
b'out of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as \xc3\x92O my friend, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, O Y\xe2\x88\x92dava,\xc3\x93 etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, \nas we can see from the behavior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.'
b'
PURPORTThe Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Without being a representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, because no one is equal to or higher than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.The Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. \nFoolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours. He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after \nquitting his body, returns to Him and doesn\xc3\x95t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; everyone is His servant. Only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His \nsuperintendence. As stated in the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, He is the cause of all causes.'

PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s devotees relate to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in various relationships; one might treat K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a son, one might treat K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a husband, as a friend, as a master, etc. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna are related in friendship. As the father tolerates, or the husband or master tolerates, so K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa tolerates.

TRANSLATION
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.
PURPORTArjuna is always in confidence with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend\xc3\x95s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to show His N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa form because He can assume any form. This universal form is \nmaterial and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planet the form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. \nAccording to the different hands these four things are held in, the N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aas '
b'are named. All of these forms are one and the same to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

TRANSLATION
O universal Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form.
PURPORTIn the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9ha, N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features \noriginate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is \nGod in any of His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of '
b'Godhead. One who knows K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has \never seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.
PURPORTArjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces \nwere rapidly changing. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to '
b'Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown \nto Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one has ever seen this form before.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, \nnor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.'
b'
PURPORTThe divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au are demigods. Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or who only recognize the impersonal part of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and at the same time have the \ndivine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of the after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine \nnature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92dhya-yanai\xc5\xa1, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial \nregulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas (\xe2\x80\xa0k, Yajus, S\xe2\x88\x92ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas and Upani\xc5\x92ads, and One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are and for studying the method of sacrifice. D\xe2\x88\x92nai\xc5\xa1 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aavas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious activities and the \nvoluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya. So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that \nuniversal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we understand '
b'that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that \nthey have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.

PURPORTIn the beginning of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 Arjuna was worried about killing Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d in the assembly, Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always \npeaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, while speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.
PURPORTWhen K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, He first of all appeared as four-armed N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nknew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapu\xc5\xa1 is very significant. Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as \nthe most beautiful form. When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s form, and because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful \nform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

When Arjuna thus saw K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.
PURPORTHere the words  clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that one who thinks that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an ordinary \nperson and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa speaking, is doing the greatest injustice. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has actually shown His universal form and His fourhanded Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 because he knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to \nsee this form which is so dear.
PURPORTIn the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdar\xe2\x80\x9cam is used, indicating that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal \nform, the form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva. They desire to see Him, and we have \nevidences in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva in His two-armed form.In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s body, as confirmed by Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 and '
b'confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by reading Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is a problem. For one using a material process, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn\xc3\x95t an ordinary man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal \nfeature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a \nperson. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, Chapter Two: to hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, \nand those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is covered by His yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a \nsurrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and by devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very, very \ndifficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara.

TRANSLATION
The form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, \nnor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa first appeared before His parents Devak\xe2\x80\x9d and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic interest, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not easy to understand. Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as He is. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or how He \ncame from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. As far as charity is \nconcerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa philosophy or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness throughout the world. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a the most munificent man of charity because love of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, '
b'usually of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be \nused, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.The personal forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form is N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the two-handed form is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The very word sudurdar\xe2\x80\x9cam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees \nthere was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is the origin of all \nemanations. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (which is known as Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. His name is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly, in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam there is a description of all kinds of '
b'incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas tu bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Lord says, matta\xc5\xa1 parataram n\xe2\x88\x92ny\xe2\x88\x92t: \xc3\x92There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.\xc3\x93 He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, aham \xe2\x88\x92dir hi dev\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m: \xc3\x92I am the origin of all the demigods.\xc3\x93 And after understanding Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\xe2\x80\xb9 brahma para\xe2\x80\xb9 dh\xe2\x88\x92ma pavitra\xe2\x80\xb9 parama\xe2\x80\xb9 bhav\xe2\x88\x92n: \xc3\x92I \nnow fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\xc3\x93 Therefore the universal form which K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\xc3\x95s original form.The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with \nthe Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a constant companion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating \nthemselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the most dear.

PURPORTAnyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, must take this formula, as is \nstated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse \nwhich clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to \nthe result of his work, but the result should be done for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, one has to do business for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the proprietor of '
b'the business, then K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he can do it. This is work for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and he can install the Deity of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and arrange for the Deity\xc3\x95s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One should also accept as pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, food, the remnants of offerings to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; that is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land\xc3\x91in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land\xc3\x91can utilize that for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow tulas\xe2\x80\x9d plants because tulas\xe2\x80\x9d leaves are very important, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has recommended this in \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a \nlittle water\xc3\x91and He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\xe2\x80\x9d So one can sow tulas\xe2\x80\x9d leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man \ncan engage in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.The word mat-parama\xc5\xa1 refers to one who considers the association of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly \nplanets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\xc5\xa1, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the \nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.The term sa\xef\xac\x81ga-varjita\xc5\xa1 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Not only are the atheistic persons against '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu as follows: Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and \nfrom the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, that is called pure devotional service. . One should think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and act for \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa was an enemy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s. From the very beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious \nin every respect, but that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. His only objective is to serve K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wherever he may be.\nA devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He \nwas crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\xc3\x95s '
b'neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.In summary, the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is a manifestation of the original \nor Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aus, but for a devotee, no form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is important but the original form, two-handed \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara. In the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that those who are attached to the \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is essential and supreme.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Universal Form.'
