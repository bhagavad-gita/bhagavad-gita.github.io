Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra said: O Sa\xc5\x81jaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, what did my sons and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u do, being desirous to fight?
b'want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield. Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship!even for the denizens of heaven!Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra became very \nfearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle. He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous. Sa\xc5\x81jaya was a student of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, Sa\xc5\x81jaya was able to envision the \nBattlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra even while he was in the room of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. And so, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.Both the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas and the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra belong to the same family, but Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s mind is disclosed herein. He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u from the family heritage. One can thus understand the specific position of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u. As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants \nare taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra where the father of religion, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was present, the unwanted plants like Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra\xc3\x95s son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, would be established by the Lord. This is the significance of the words dharma-k\xc5\x92etre and kuru-k\xc5\x92etre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.

He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma. On the other hand, the forces of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, who is like a fig in the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma. \nDuryodhana was always envious of Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma. But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, who was a far superior general. His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained.

TRANSLATION
Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.
PURPORTDuryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words. He emphasized that Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes would not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the \nphalanx. Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva. He was confident of the full support of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva and Dro\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna\xc3\x95s wife Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, he hoped that all \nsuch affection would now be completely given up by them, as was customary during the gambling performances.'

Then Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, the great valiant grandsire of the Kuru dynasty, the grandfather of the fighters, blew his conchshell very loudly like the sound of a lion, giving Duryodhana joy.
PURPORTThe grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion. Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was on the other side. But still, it was his duty to conduct the fight, and no pains would be spared in that connection.

On the other side, both Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.'

PURPORTIn contrast with the conchshell blown by Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92madeva, the conchshells in the hands of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna are described as transcendental. The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was on the side of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas.

Victory is always with persons like \nthe sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u because Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because \nthe goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds.

Then, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa blew His conchshell, called P\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81cajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Pau\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8ram.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is referred to as H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca in this verse because He is the owner of all senses The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their \nsenses. But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca. The Lord has different names because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva \nbecause He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devak\xe2\x80\x9d-nandana because He accepted Devak\xe2\x80\x9d as His mother; His name is Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92 at V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana; His name is P\xe2\x88\x92rtha-s\xe2\x88\x92rathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra.Arjuna is referred to as Dhana\xc5\x81jaya in this verse because he helped his elder \nbrother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices. Similarly, Bh\xe2\x80\x9dma is known as V\xe2\x80\x9ekodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hi\xc5\xb8imba. So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, beginning with the Lord\xc3\x95s, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers. On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme \ndirector, nor that of the goddess of fortune. So, they were predestined to lose '
b'the battle!and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.

TRANSLATION
O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, who was seated in his chariot, his flag marked with Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his \narrows, looking at the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. O King, Arjuna then spoke to H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] these words:
PURPORTThe battle was just about to begin. It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra were more or less disheartened by the '
b'unexpected arrangement of military force by the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa on the battlefield. The emblem of Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n cooperated with Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma in the battle between R\xe2\x88\x92ma and R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa, and Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma emerged victorious. Now both R\xe2\x88\x92ma and Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is R\xe2\x88\x92ma Himself, and wherever Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma is, His eternal servitor Hanum\xe2\x88\x92n and His eternal consort S\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any \nenemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O infallible one, please draw my chariot between the two armies so that I may see who is present here, who is desirous of fighting, and with whom I must contend in this great battle attempt.
PURPORTAlthough Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged. In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and \nHis servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee\xc3\x95s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the \ninfallible master of all circumstances.As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation. Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were. Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they \nwere bent upon demanding an unwanted war.'

Let me see those who have come here to fight, wishing to please the evil-minded son of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra.
PURPORTIt was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather. Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of \nproposing peace negotiations with them. It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was sitting by his side.

TRANSLATION
Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.
PURPORTIn this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca. Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ka means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As a great devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he could not forget K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s name, form, quality and pastimes. Thus a devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can conquer both sleep and \nignorance simply by thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa constantly. This is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. As H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could understand Arjuna\xc3\x95s purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.

In the presence of Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa and all other chieftains of the world, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the Lord, said, Just behold, P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, all the Kurus who are assembled here.
PURPORTAs the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, or the son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d or P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a \nfriend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. Now what did K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa mean when He told Arjuna to \xc3\x92behold the Kurus\xc3\x93? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa never expected such things from the son of His aunt P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicated by the Lord in friendly joking.

Arjuna said: My dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth \ndrying up.'
b'
PURPORTAny man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities. As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves. As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he \nfelt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna\xc3\x95s bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was \nalso crying out of compassion. Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:yasy\xe2\x88\x92sti bhaktir bhagavaty aki\xc5\x81can\xe2\x88\x92sarvair gu\xe2\x80\x9aais tatra sam\xe2\x88\x92sate sur\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1har\xe2\x88\x92v abhaktasya kuto mahad-gu\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92mano-rathen\xe2\x88\x92sati dh\xe2\x88\x92vato bahi\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 5.18.12)

PURPORTThere are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end. Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions. There is no fear in transcendental realization. Arjuna\xc3\x95s symptoms in this situation are out of material fear\xc3\x91namely, loss of life. This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow G\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9dva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin. All these are due to a material conception of life.

I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I foresee only evil, O killer of the Ke\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d demon.
PURPORTDue to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind. Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence. Bhaya\xe2\x80\xb9 dvit\xe2\x80\x9dy\xe2\x88\x92bhinive\xe2\x80\x9cata\xc5\xa1: such fearfulness and loss of mental \nequilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions. Arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battlefield\xc3\x91he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe. The word nimitta is significant. When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, \xc3\x92Why am I here?\xc3\x93 Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare. No one is interested in the Supreme Self. Arjuna is supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is everyone\xc3\x95s real self-interest. \nThe conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains. Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.

I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.
PURPORTWithout knowing that one\xc3\x95s self-interest is in Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au (or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations. Under delusion, they forget that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is also the cause of material happiness. Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a k\xc5\x92atriya. It is said that two kinds of men, namely the k\xc5\x92atriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s personal orders and the \nperson in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun-globe, which is so powerful and dazzling. Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives. He thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as a k\xc5\x92atriya, he requires a kingdom for \nhis subsistence, because the k\xc5\x92atriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation. But Arjuna has had no kingdom. Arjuna\xc3\x95s sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do. Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.

TRANSLATION
O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
PURPORTArjuna has addressed Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Govinda because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses. Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way\xc3\x91namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda \nwithout desiring to satisfy one\xc3\x95s own senses\xc3\x91then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied. Arjuna\xc3\x95s deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his '
b'opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.

TRANSLATION
Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors. Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra and our friends. What should we gain, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our \nown kinsmen?
PURPORTAccording to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another\xc3\x95s land, and \n6) one who kidnaps a wife. Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors. Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person. He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness. This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a k\xc5\x92atriya. Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he \nshould not be cowardly. For example, Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma was so saintly that people \nwere anxious to live in His kingdom, (R\xe2\x88\x92ma-r\xe2\x88\x92jya), but Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma never showed any cowardice. R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa was an aggressor against R\xe2\x88\x92ma because he kidnapped R\xe2\x88\x92ma\xc3\x95s wife, S\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, but Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. In Arjuna\xc3\x95s case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides \nthat, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency. Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his \nown kinsmen? Arjuna\xc3\x95s addressing of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as \xc3\x92M\xe2\x88\x92dhava,\xc3\x93 or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not '
b'have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.

O Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, although these men, overtaken by greed, see no fault in killing one\xc3\x95s family or quarreling with friends, why should we, with knowledge of the \nsin, engage in these acts?'
b'
PURPORTA k\xc5\x92atriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party. Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight because he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana. In this connection, Arjuna considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a challenge. Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept the challenge. Obligation is actually binding when the effect is good, but when the effect is otherwise, then no one can be bound. \nConsidering all these pros and cons, Arjuna decided not to fight.

With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice.
PURPORTIn the system of the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution there are many principles of religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values. The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family, beginning from birth to death. But on the death of the elder members, such family traditions of purification may stop, and the '
b'remaining younger family members may develop irreligious habits and thereby lose their chance for spiritual salvation. Therefore, for no purpose should the elder members of the family be slain.

PURPORTGood population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. The var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama religion\xc3\x95s principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the \ngeneral spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to C\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aakya Pa\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8it, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So, the different family traditions of '
b'religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama system. On the failure of such var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.

TRANSLATION
When there is increase of unwanted population, a hellish situation is created both for the family and for those who destroy the family tradition. In such \ncorrupt families, there is no offering of oblations of food and water to the ancestors.
PURPORTAccording to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family. This offering is performed by worship of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, because eating the remnants of food offered to Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions. Sometimes '
b'the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants of pras\xe2\x88\x92dam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released \nfrom ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can \ndeliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery.

PURPORTArjuna bases his argument not on his own personal experience, but on what he has heard from the authorities. That is the way of receiving real knowledge. One cannot reach the real point of factual knowledge without being helped by the right person who is already established in that knowledge. There is a system in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution by which one has to undergo the process of ablution before death for his sinful activities. One who is always engaged in sinful activities must utilize the process of ablution called the \npr\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9ccitta. Without doing so, one surely will be transferred to hellish planets to undergo miserable lives as the result of sinful activities.

PURPORTDriven by selfish motives, one may be inclined to such sinful acts as the killing of one\xc3\x95s own brother, father, or mother. There are many such instances in the history of the world. But Arjuna, being a saintly devotee of the Lord, is '
b'always conscious of moral principles and therefore takes care to avoid such activities.

PURPORTIt is the custom\xc3\x91according to k\xc5\x92atriya fighting principles\xc3\x91that an unarmed and unwilling foe should not be attacked. Arjuna, however, in such an enigmatic position, decided he would not fight if he were attacked by the enemy. He did not consider how much the other party was bent upon fighting. All these symptoms are due to softheartedness resulting from his being a great devotee of the Lord.'

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes 
PURPORTMaterial compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self. Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization. The word Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty. No one knows where compassion should be applied. Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress\xc3\x91the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a or one who laments \nunnecessarily. Arjuna was a k\xc5\x92atriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This realization is made possible by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Person [Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is referred to as \xc3\x92Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n\xc3\x93 throughout the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; \nParam\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\xe2\x80\xb9 yaj j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam advayambrahmeti param\xe2\x88\x92tmeti bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n iti \xe2\x80\x9cabdyate.\xc3\x92The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun\xc3\x95s surface and the sun planet itself. One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun\xc3\x95s surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine\xc3\x91its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature\xc3\x91may be compared to those who can \nrealize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has '
b'advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n feature of the Absolute \nTruth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet \ncannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.The Sanskrit word Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n is explained by the great authority, Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara Muni, the father of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one \ncan claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva, or N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, can possess opulences as fully as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 by Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 himself that Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha\xc5\xa1an\xe2\x88\x92dir \xe2\x88\x92dir govinda\xc5\xa1 sarua-k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aa-k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aam\xc3\x92There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.\xc3\x93 (Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 5.1)In the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:ete c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9ca-kal\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 pu\xe2\x80\xb9sa\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas tu bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n svayamindr\xe2\x88\x92ri-vy\xe2\x88\x92kula\xe2\x80\xb9 loka\xe2\x80\xb9 m\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\xb8ayanti yuge yuge'
b'\xc3\x92All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.\xc3\x93 (Bhag. 1.3.28)Therefore, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna\xc3\x95s lamentation \nfor his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa expressed His surprise with the word kutas, \xc3\x92wherefrom.\xc3\x93 Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as \xe2\x80\xa2ryans. The word \xe2\x88\x92ryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, and they are captivated by the \nexternal features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-\xe2\x80\xa2ryans. Although Arjuna was a k\xc5\x92atriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-\xe2\x80\xa2ryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa did not approve of \nthe so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.

O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.
PURPORTArjuna was addressed as the \xc3\x92son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92,\xc3\x93 who happened to be the sister of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s father Vasudeva. Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a k\xc5\x92atriya in name only, and if the son of a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa acts impiously, he is a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa in name only. \nSuch k\xc5\x92atriyas and br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a k\xc5\x92atriya. Arjuna was the most intimate friend of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was directly guiding him on \nthe chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality. Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the \nmost respectable Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and his relatives, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though they are avaricious, they are nonetheless superiors. If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood.
PURPORTAccording to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned. Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his financial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a position simply on financial considerations. Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of teachers. But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.

TRANSLATION
Nor do we know which is better\xc3\x91conquering them or being conquered by them. The sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield.
PURPORTArjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the k\xc5\x92atriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging. If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra died in battle, it would be \nvery difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations by Arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (his spiritual \nmaster), indicate. It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation. Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships.

TRANSLATION
Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for \nme. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.
PURPORTBy nature\xc3\x95s own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone. In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic \nwisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the \nproblems of life. In the Garga Upani\xc5\x92ad the perplexed man is described as follows:'
b'yo v\xe2\x88\x92 etad ak\xc5\x92ara\xe2\x80\xb9 g\xe2\x88\x92rgy aviditv\xe2\x88\x92sm\xe2\x88\x92l lok\xe2\x88\x92t praiti sa k\xe2\x80\x9epa\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\xc3\x93 This human form of life is a most valuable asset \nfor the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.The k\xe2\x80\x9epa\xe2\x80\x9aas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other \nmembers, on the basis of \xc3\x92skin disease.\xc3\x93 The k\xe2\x80\x9epa\xe2\x80\x9aa thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the k\xe2\x80\x9epa\xe2\x80\x9aa thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on \naccount of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-\ng\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is stated in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a person, but to \xc3\x92the unborn within K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.\xc3\x93 There is no difference between K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s within and without. And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.'

TRANSLATION
I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with \nsovereignty like the demigods in heaven.
PURPORTAlthough Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., \nare all useless in solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life. Lord Caitanya said that one who is '
b'master in the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.yei k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-tattva-vett\xe2\x88\x92, sei \xc3\x94guru\xc3\x95 haya.(Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta, Madhya 8.127)\xc3\x92It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life\xc3\x91if he \nis master in the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master.\xc3\x93 So without being a master in the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master. It is also said in Vedic literatures:\xc5\x92a\xc4\xb1-karma-nipu\xe2\x80\x9ao vipro mantra-tantra-vi\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92rada\xc5\xa1avai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aavo gurur na sy\xe2\x88\x92d vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9cvapaco guru\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92A scholarly br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava, or expert in the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious.\xc3\x93The problems of material existence\xc3\x91birth, old age, disease and death\xc3\x91cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development. In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, \nyet the problems of material existence are still present. They are seeking peace in different ways, but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam\xc3\x91which constitute the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91or the bona fide representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.If economic development and material comforts could drive away one\xc3\x95s lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then \nArjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations. He sought, therefore, refuge in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony. Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature. Even elevation into a higher planetary '
b'situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke. The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 confirms this: k\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9ae pu\xe2\x80\x9aye martyaloka\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xe2\x80\x9canti \xc3\x92When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life.\xc3\x93 Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way. Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as Arjuna is seeking to do. So Arjuna asked K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to solve his \nproblem definitely, and that is the way of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

PURPORTDh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging '
b'profession. But Sa\xc5\x81jaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (parantapa\xc5\xa1). Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple. This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and would then surely fight.

TRANSLATION
O descendant of Bharata, at that time K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.
PURPORTThe talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca and the Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the '
b'superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master\xc3\x91with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted. So the talks of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living \nnor the dead.
PURPORTThe Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool. The Lord said, you are talking like a '
b'learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned\xc3\x91one who knows what is body and what is soul\xc3\x91does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition. As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both. Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies. And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he \nshould not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul. One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.

PURPORT'
b'In the Vedas, in the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad as well as in the \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad, it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity. Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord, can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.nityo nity\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 cetana\xe2\x80\x9c cetan\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92mtam \xe2\x88\x92tmastha\xe2\x80\xb9 ye \xc3\x95nupa\xe2\x80\x9cyanti dh\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x88\x92ste\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92nti\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvat\xe2\x80\x9d netare\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92m.(Ka\xc4\xb1ha 2.2.13)The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge. The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in \ntheir conditioned as well as in their liberated situations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord\xc3\x95s eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons. It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons. Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption. Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and \nlose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme authority. Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upani\xc5\x92ads, will continue eternally. This statement of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is authoritative \nbecause K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa cannot be subject to illusion. If individuality is not a fact, then K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa would not have stressed it so much\xc3\x91even for the future. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d may argue that the individuality spoken of by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not spiritual, but '
b'material. Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s individuality? K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also. He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 has no value as authoritative scripture. A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is \nworth hearing. The G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is above such literature. No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. When one accepts K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as an ordinary man, the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 loses all importance. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body. But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned. After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is \nmaintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas like \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d R\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92nuja and others. It is clearly mentioned in many places in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord. Those who are envious of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature. The nondevotee\xc3\x95s approach to the teachings of the G\xe2\x80\x9dta is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey. One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle. Similarly, the \nmysticism of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book. Nor can the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord. Therefore, the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d explanation of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth. Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9ds and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d philosophy loses all power to understand \nthe real mystery of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord. The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.'

TRANSLATION
As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.
PURPORTSince every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man. Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change. This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth\xc3\x91either material or spiritual\xc3\x91there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma nor for Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, for whom he was so much concerned. Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy. Such \nchanges of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one\xc3\x95s work in life. So Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.'
b'Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature!both material and spiritual!is called a dh\xe2\x80\x9dra or a most sober man. Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion. Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.As confirmed in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist \neternally (san\xe2\x88\x92tana) and are called k\xc5\x92ara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature. These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same!fragmental. But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the \nPersonality of Godhead. The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, who is different from the individual living entity. When the \nsky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also. The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord. The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter. If Arjuna is on the same level with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and \ninstructed becomes meaningless. If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed. Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, no one can be an authoritative instructor. Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul deluded by m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92.

O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of \nBharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.
PURPORTIn the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress. According to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the \nmonth of M\xe2\x88\x92gha (January-February). It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath. Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season. One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences. Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the k\xc5\x92atriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to \nfollow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 (illusion).The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant. To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother\xc3\x95s side; and to address him as Bh\xe2\x88\x92rata signifies his greatness from his father\xc3\x95s side. From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage. A great heritage brings \nresponsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.'

In the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa) is a painstaking situation. But one who is serious about making his life perfect \nsurely adopts the sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa order of life in spite of all difficulties. The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children. But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, in Arjuna\xc3\x95s discharge of duties as a k\xc5\x92atriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. Lord Caitanya took sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependants, young \nwife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them. Yet for a higher cause He took sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties. That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.'

TRANSLATION
Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the nonexistent there is no endurance, and of the existent there is no cessation. This seers have concluded by studying the nature of both.
PURPORTThere is no endurance of the changing body. That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body. But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind. That is the difference between matter and spirit. By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal. This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist. In the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa it is stated that Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence. \xc3\x92Jyot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xb9\xc5\x92i vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aur bhavan\xe2\x88\x92ni vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au\xc5\xa1.\xc3\x93 \nThe words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter. That is the version of all seers of truth.This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance. Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the '
b'worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part and parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole. In the as well as in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations. Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences. The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be \nrevealed in the Seventh Chapter. Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate. The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught. Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 for the enlightenment of all living entities for \nall time.

TRANSLATION

PURPORTThis verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one\xc3\x95s own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul\xc3\x95s presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This \nsoul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad confirms this:b\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x88\x92gra-\xe2\x80\x9cata-bh\xe2\x88\x92gasya \xe2\x80\x9catadh\xe2\x88\x92 kalpitasya cabh\xe2\x88\x92go j\xe2\x80\x9dva\xc5\xa1 sa vij\xc5\x81eya\xc5\xa1 sa c\xe2\x88\x92nanty\xe2\x88\x92ya kalpate. \xc3\x92When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul.\xc3\x93 (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam the same version is stated:ke\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92gra-\xe2\x80\x9cata-bh\xe2\x88\x92gasya \xe2\x80\x9cat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9ca\xc5\xa1 s\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92tmaka\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair.\xc3\x93Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small \nspiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body \nminus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mu\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8aka Upani\xc5\x92ad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:'
b'e\xc5\x92o \xc3\x95\xe2\x80\x9aur\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 cetas\xe2\x88\x92 veditavyoyasmin pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 pa\xc5\x81cadh\xe2\x88\x92 sa\xe2\x80\xb9vive\xe2\x80\x9capr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aai\xe2\x80\x9c citta\xe2\x80\xb9 sarvam otam praj\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9yasmin vi\xe2\x80\x9cuddhe vibhavaty e\xc5\x92a \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92.\xc3\x92The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, ap\xe2\x88\x92na, vy\xe2\x88\x92na, sam\xe2\x88\x92na and ud\xe2\x88\x92na], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited.\xc3\x93 (Mu\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8. 3.1.9)The ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures\xc3\x91not for any \nmaterial profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man. Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-tattva.The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body. According to the Mu\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8aka Upani\xc5\x92ad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul. The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body. The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul. When the soul \npasses away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases. Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul. Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules. In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules. Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the \nSupreme Lord, called by the name prabh\xe2\x88\x92 or superior energy. Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the '
b'body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 by the Personality of Godhead Himself.

TRANSLATION
Only the material body of the indestructible, immeasurable and eternal living entity is subject to destruction; therefore, fight, O descendant of Bharata.
PURPORTThe material body is perishable by nature. It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years. It is a question of time only. There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of \nlamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In the  the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight '
b'maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant. Arjuna was advised to fight and sacrifice the material body for the cause of religion.

TRANSLATION
He who thinks that the living entity is the slayer or that he is slain, does not understand. One who is in knowledge knows that the self slays not nor is slain.
PURPORTWhen an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as is evident from the \nprevious verses. Nor is the living entity killable because of his spiritual constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only. This, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic injunction is, \xc3\x92\xc3\x93 never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable '
b'by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically.

TRANSLATION
For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primeval. He is \nnot slain when the body is slain.
PURPORTQualitatively, the small atomic fragmental part of the Supreme Spirit is one with the Supreme. He undergoes no changes like the body. Sometimes the soul is called the steady, or The body is subject to six kinds of transformations. It takes its birth in the womb of the mother\xc3\x95s body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes '
b'its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval\xc3\x91that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate \nlike a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul\xc3\x95s presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.In the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad also we find a similar passage which reads:na j\xe2\x88\x92yate mriyate v\xe2\x88\x92 vipa\xe2\x80\x9ccinajo nitya\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvato \xc3\x95ya\xe2\x80\xb9 pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aona hanyate hanyam\xe2\x88\x92ne \xe2\x80\x9car\xe2\x80\x9dre.(Ka\xc4\xb1ha 1.2.18)The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipa\xe2\x80\x9ccit, which means learned \nor with knowledge.The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness. Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul. Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness. Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime. As \nsoon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky. Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies\xc3\x91whether man or animal\xc3\x91we can understand the presence of the soul. This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge\xc3\x91past, present and future. The consciousness of the individual soul '
b'is prone to be forgetful. When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not like the forgetful soul. If so, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s teachings of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 would be useless.There are two kinds of souls!namely the minute particle soul (a\xe2\x80\x9au-\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92).

TRANSLATION
O P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn, eternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?
PURPORTEverything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility. Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. In Manu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king\xc3\x95s \npunishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted. A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him. Therefore the fighting to be \nexecuted by Arjuna at the instruction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction.

TRANSLATION
As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.
PURPORTChange of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact. Even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have \nto accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age. From old age, the change is transferred to another body. This has already been explained in the previous verse.Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul.The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another. The Vedas, like the Mu\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8aka \nUpani\xc5\x92ad, as well as the \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree. One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa) is simply watching His friend. Of these two birds!although they are the same in quality!one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while \nthe other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird. Although they are friends, one \nis still the master and the other is the servant. Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one\xc3\x95s changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another. The j\xe2\x80\x9dva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master!as Arjuna agreed to do by '
b'voluntary surrender unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa for instruction!the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations. Both the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad and \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad confirm this:sam\xe2\x88\x92ne v\xe2\x80\x9ek\xc5\x92e puru\xc5\x92o nimagno\xc3\x95n\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cay\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x80\x9cocati muhyam\xe2\x88\x92na\xc5\xa1ju\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a\xe2\x80\xb9 yad\xe2\x88\x92 pa\xe2\x80\x9cyaty anyam \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cam asyamahim\xe2\x88\x92nam iti v\xe2\x80\x9dta-\xe2\x80\x9coka\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree. But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories\xc3\x91at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties.\xc3\x93 Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and is understanding the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from Him. And thus, hearing from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher. He should rather be happy to kill their \nbodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities. One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life. So there was no cause for Arjuna\xc3\x95s lamentation.

TRANSLATION
The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.
PURPORTAll kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill the spirit soul. It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire. Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but \nformerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements. Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science. Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons. Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from \nignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy. Because they are atomic individual souls (san\xe2\x88\x92tana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire. In the Var\xe2\x88\x92ha Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the \nSupreme. They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 also. So, even \nafter being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna. Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but he never became one with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried. He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.
PURPORTAll these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change. The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never \nexpected to become one homogeneously. After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.The word sarva-gata\xc5\xa1 (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God\xc3\x95s creation. They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire. The belief that they \nare sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire. Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there. If the sun globe is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gata\xc5\xa1!living everywhere!becomes meaningless.'

TRANSLATION
It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and unchangeable. Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.
PURPORTAs described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul\xc3\x95s existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of \xe2\x80\x9cruti or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no \nother source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious\xc3\x91that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in \nthe soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to '
b'the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly without error.

TRANSLATION
If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.
PURPORTThere is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body. When Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa spoke the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lok\xe2\x88\x92yatikas and Vaibh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ikas. These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms '
b'develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo-religions\xc3\x91now becoming fashionable in America\xc3\x91are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul!as in the Vaibh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ika philosophy!there would still have been no cause for lamentation. No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty. On the other hand, in modern science and scientific \nwarfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy. According to the Vaibh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ika philosophy, the so-called soul or \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 vanishes along with the deterioration of the body. So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament. According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every \nmoment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence. However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher. But at the same time, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa sarcastically addressed Arjuna as mah\xe2\x88\x92-b\xe2\x88\x92hu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the \nVaibh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom. As a k\xc5\x92atriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its \nprinciples.

In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without liberation. This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war. But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.The Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a k\xc5\x92atriya. Why should he \nbe afraid of or aggrieved at the death of his relatives since he was discharging his proper duty? He did not deserve to break the law, thereby becoming subjected to the reactions of sinful acts, of which he was so afraid. By avoiding the discharge of his proper duty, he would not be able to stop the death of his relatives, and he would be degraded due to his selection of the wrong path of action.

TRANSLATION
All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated. So what need is there for lamentation?
PURPORTAccepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case. Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument\xc3\x95s sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material \nelements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in \ncourse of time things are manifested and unmanifested\xc3\x91that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 \n(antavanta ime deh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyokt\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9car\xe2\x80\x9dri\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the '
b'changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul. It is something like a dream. In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot. The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body. Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.

Some look on the soul as amazing, some describe him as amazing, and some hear of him as amazing, while others, even after hearing about him, cannot understand him at all.
PURPORTSince G\xe2\x80\x9dtopani\xc5\x92ad is largely based on the principles of the Upani\xc5\x92ads, it is not surprising to also find this passage in the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad.'

Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross \nmaterial conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one \nhas no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their \nrespective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one\xc3\x95s life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 spoken by the greatest authority, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, without \nbeing deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to '
b'accept K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.

O descendant of Bharata, he who dwells in the body is eternal and can never be slain. Therefore you need not grieve for any creature.
PURPORTThe Lord now concludes the chapter of instruction on the immutable spirit soul. In describing the immortal soul in various ways, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa establishes that the soul is immortal and the body is temporary. Therefore Arjuna as a k\xc5\x92atriya should not abandon his duty out of fear that his grandfather and teacher\xc3\x91Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91will die in the battle. On the authority of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals. Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it. That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.'

TRANSLATION
Considering your specific duty as a k\xc5\x92atriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation.
PURPORTOut of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called k\xc5\x92atriya. K\xc5\x92at means hurt. One who gives protection from harm is called k\xc5\x92atriya (trayate\xc3\x91to give protection). The k\xc5\x92atriyas are trained for killing in the forest. A k\xc5\x92atriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword. When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation. This system is being followed even up to the present day by the k\xc5\x92atriya kings of Jaipur state. The k\xc5\x92atriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing \nbecause religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor. Therefore, k\xc5\x92atriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa or renunciation. \nNonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle. In the religious law books it is stated:'
b'\xe2\x88\x92have\xc5\x92u mitho \xc3\x95nyonya\xe2\x80\xb9 jigh\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9santo mah\xe2\x80\x9dk\xc5\x92ita\xc5\xa1yuddham\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 para\xe2\x80\xb9 \xe2\x80\x9cakty\xe2\x88\x92 svarga\xe2\x80\xb9 y\xe2\x88\x92nty apar\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81mukh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1yaj\xc5\x81e\xc5\x92u pa\xe2\x80\x9cavo brahman hanyante satata\xe2\x80\xb9 dvijai\xc5\xa1sa\xe2\x80\xb9sk\xe2\x80\x9et\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 kila mantrai\xe2\x80\x9c ca te \xc3\x95pi svargam av\xe2\x88\x92pnuvan.\xc3\x92In the battlefield, a king or k\xc5\x92atriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire.\xc3\x93 Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved. The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the k\xc5\x92atriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas who attain them by offering sacrifice.There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties. As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation. When one is liberated, one\xc3\x95s svadharma\xc3\x91specific duty\xc3\x91becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept. In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and k\xc5\x92atriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable. Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter. On the bodily plane svadharma is called var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, or man\xc3\x95s steppingstone for spiritual understanding. Human civilization begins from the stage of var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific \nmodes of nature of the body obtained. Discharging one\xc3\x95s specific duty in any field of action in accordance with var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.

O P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, happy are the k\xc5\x92atriyas to whom such fighting opportunities come unsought, opening for them the doors of the heavenly planets.
PURPORTAs supreme teacher of the world, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa condemns the attitude of Arjuna who said, \xc3\x92I do not find any good in this fighting. It will cause perpetual habitation in hell.\xc3\x93 Such statements by Arjuna were due to \nignorance only. He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty. For a k\xc5\x92atriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools. In the Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara-sm\xe2\x80\x9eti or religious codes made by Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara, the great sage and father of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva, it is stated:k\xc5\x92atriyo hi praj\xe2\x88\x92 rak\xc5\x92an \xe2\x80\x9castra-p\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai\xc5\xa1 prada\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8ayannirjitya parasainy\xe2\x88\x92di k\xc5\x92iti\xe2\x80\xb9 dharme\xe2\x80\x9aa p\xe2\x88\x92layet.\xc3\x92The k\xc5\x92atriya\xc3\x95s duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order. \nTherefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world.\xc3\x93Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting. If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him. Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.'

If, however, you do not fight this religious war, then you will certainly incur sins for neglecting your duties and thus lose your reputation as a fighter.
PURPORTArjuna was a famous fighter, and he attained fame by fighting many great demigods, including even Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva. After fighting and defeating Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva in the dress of a hunter, Arjuna pleased the Lord and received as a reward a weapon called p\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cupata-astra. Everyone knew that he was a great warrior. Even Dro\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya gave him benediction and awarded him the special weapon \nby which he could kill even his teacher. So he was credited with so many military certificates from many authorities, including his adopted father Indra, the heavenly king. But if he abandoned the battle, he would not only neglect his specific duty as a k\xc5\x92atriya, but he would lose all his fame and good name and thus prepare his royal road to hell. In other words, he would go to hell, not by fighting, but by withdrawing from battle.

PURPORTBoth as friend and philosopher to Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa now gives His final judgement regarding Arjuna\xc3\x95s refusal to fight. The Lord says, \xc3\x92Arjuna, if you leave the battlefield, people will call you a coward even before your actual flight. And if you think that people may call you bad names but that you will save your life by fleeing the battlefield, then My advice is that you\xc3\x95d do better to die in the battle. For a respectable man like you, ill fame is worse than death. So, you should not flee for fear of your life; better to die in the battle. That will save you from the ill fame of misusing My friendship and from losing \nyour prestige in society.\xc3\x93So, the final judgement of the Lord was for Arjuna to die in the battle and not withdraw.

Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat\xc3\x91and, by so doing, you shall never incur sin.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting because He desires the battle. There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That everything should be performed for the sake of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is \ntranscendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities. He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad. But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities.

TRANSLATION
Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy. Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result. O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, when you act by such intelligence, you can free \nyourself from the bondage of works.
PURPORTAccording to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sa\xef\xac\x81khya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and sa\xef\xac\x81khya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. And yoga involves controlling the \nsenses. Arjuna\xc3\x95s proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. '
b'Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of persona1 sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He \nexplained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners. But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. And this \ndescriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. This s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya has nothing to do with the s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy of the atheist Kapila. Long before the imposter Kapila\xc3\x95s s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya, the s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy was expounded in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation explained by Him that the Puru\xc5\x92a, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He \ncreates by looking over the prak\xe2\x80\x9eti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prak\xe2\x80\x9eti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.Arjuna has already accepted K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: \xe2\x80\x9ci\xc5\x92yas te \xc3\x95ha\xe2\x80\xb9 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92dhi m\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 tv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 prapannam. Consequently, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense '
b'gratification of the Lord. This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 in everyone\xc3\x95s heart. But such communion does not take place without devotional service. One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord. The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure \nknowledge of devotion in love. In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila. One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya. Nor did that philosophy have any \ninfluence during that time; nor would Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa care to mention such godless philosophical speculations. Real s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, but even that s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya has nothing to do with the current topics. Here, s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya means analytical description of the body and the soul. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. Therefore, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya and Lord Kapila\xc3\x95s s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya, as described in the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam; \nare one and the same. They are all bhakti-yoga. He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.\nOf course, atheistic s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service. One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss. By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge. There is much difference between work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness. Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.

TRANSLATION
In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.
PURPORTActivity in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or acting for the benefit of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work. Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage. Any work begun on the material \nplane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure. But any work begun in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished. The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is incomplete. One percent done in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent '
b'success, there is no profit. Aj\xe2\x88\x92mila performed his duty in some percentage of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord. There is a nice verse in this connection in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam:tyaktv\xe2\x88\x92 sva-dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 cara\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92mbuja\xe2\x80\xb9 harerbhajan na pakko \xc3\x95tha patet tato yadiko v\xe2\x88\x92rtha \xe2\x88\x92pto \xc3\x95bhajat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sva-dharmata\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, \xc3\x92What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?\xc3\x93Material activities and their results end with the body. But work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness carries the person again to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, even after the \nloss of the body. At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for \nelevation.

Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one. O beloved child of the Kurus, the intelligence of those who are irresolute is many-branched.
PURPORTA strong faith in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called vyavas\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92tmik\xe2\x88\x92 intelligence. The Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta states:\xc3\x94\xe2\x80\x9craddh\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95-\xe2\x80\x9cabde vi\xe2\x80\x9cv\xe2\x88\x92sa kahe sud\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\xb8ha ni\xe2\x80\x9ccayak\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ae bhakti kaile sarva-karma k\xe2\x80\x9eta hayaFaith means unflinching trust in something sublime. When one is engaged in the duties of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality. Fruitive activities are the engagements of one\xc3\x95s reactions from past good or bad deeds. When one is awake in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities. When one is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad. The highest perfection of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life. This state is \nautomatically achieved by progressive K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The resolute purpose of a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is based on knowledge (\xc3\x92V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva\xc5\xa1 sarvam iti sa mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 sudurlabha\xc5\xa1\xc3\x93) by which one comes to know perfectly \nthat V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the root of all manifested causes. As water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can render the highest service to everyone\xc3\x91namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is satisfied by one\xc3\x95s actions, \nthen everyone will be satisfied.Service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who '
b'knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As such, to be well-versed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one\xc3\x95s mission in life. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dla Vi\xe2\x80\x9cvan\xe2\x88\x92tha Cakravart\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:yasya pras\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x88\x92d bhagavat-pras\xe2\x88\x92doyasy\xe2\x88\x92pras\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x88\x92nna gati\xc5\xa1 kuto \xc3\x95pidhy\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\xb9 stuva\xe2\x80\xb9s tasya ya\xe2\x80\x9cas tri-sandhya\xe2\x80\xb9vande guro\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9cr\xe2\x80\x9d-cara\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92ravindam.\xc3\x92By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied. And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my \nrespectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master.\xc3\x93The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body\xc3\x91not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities. One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.

TRANSLATION
Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth. Being desirous of sense \ngratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.
PURPORTPeople in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a portions of the Vedas. They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the Vedas many sacrifices \nare recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyoti\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1oma sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly \nunenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.'
b'In the karma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-k\xe2\x88\x92nana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature. Rise above these modes, O Arjuna. Be transcendental to all of them. Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.
PURPORTAll material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually '
b'elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92, or questions on the Supreme \nTranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense gratification, namely the \nkarma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upani\xc5\x92ads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mah\xe2\x88\x92bh\xe2\x88\x92rata. The Upani\xc5\x92ads mark the beginning of transcendental life.As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities \nbecome free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This transcendental position is achieved in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa

TRANSLATION
All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the great reservoirs of water. Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.
PURPORTThe rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization. And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the primeval cause of everything. So, self-realization means understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and one\xc3\x95s eternal relationship with Him. The \nrelationship of the living entities with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The living entities are parts and parcels of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore, revival of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge. This is confirmed in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (3.33.7) as follows:aho bata \xe2\x80\x9cvapaco\xc3\x95to gar\xe2\x80\x9dy\xe2\x88\x92nyaj-jihv\xe2\x88\x92gre vartate n\xe2\x88\x92ma tubhyamtepus tapas te juhuvu\xc5\xa1 sasnur \xe2\x88\x92ry\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x92O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92la [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization. Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage. Such a person is considered to be the best of the \xe2\x80\xa2ryan family.\xc3\x93 So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification. It is not possible for the \ncommon man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Ved\xe2\x88\x92ntas and the Upani\xc5\x92ads. It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas. This is hardly possible in this age. The best purpose of Vedic culture is '
b'served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls. When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92nanda Sarasvat\xe2\x80\x9d, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman. In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta philosophy; the best purpose of Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord. Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta philosophy is Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord. That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.

PURPORTThere are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction. Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the modes of material nature. Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one\xc3\x95s prescribed duties. The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result. One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action. Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of \nthe result of such actions.As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities. Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for results. As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness. Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious. Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties, \nbut should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result. His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment. Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation. Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage. Inaction is sinful. Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of \nsalvation for Arjuna.

TRANSLATION
Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna. Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure. Such evenness of mind is called yoga.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga. And what is that yoga? Yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses. And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord. And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with \nthe results of the fight. Gain or victory are K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The following of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. By K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or the servant of the servant of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is the right way to discharge duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga.\nArjuna is a k\xc5\x92atriya, and as such he is participating in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma institution. It is said in the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au Pura\xe2\x80\x9aa that in the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. So, unless one satisfies K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot correctly observe the principles of var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma. Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa told him.

TRANSLATION
O Dhana\xc5\x81jaya, rid yourself of all fruitive activities by devotional service, and surrender fully to that consciousness. Those who want to enjoy the fruits of \ntheir work are misers.
PURPORTOne who has actually come to understand one\xc3\x95s constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcendental loving service to the Lord. Such devotional service is the right course of action for the living entity. Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work \njust to be further entangled in material bondage. Except for work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and that will make one\xc3\x95s life \nsuccessful. Like the misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the Lord.

A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, O Arjuna, which is the art of all work.
PURPORTSince time immemorial each living entity has accumulated the various reactions of his good and bad work, As such, he is continuously ignorant of his real constitutional position. One\xc3\x95s ignorance can be removed by the instruction of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 which teaches one to surrender unto Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in all respects and become liberated from the chained victimization of action and reaction, birth after birth.

TRANSLATION
The wise, engaged in devotional service, take refuge in the Lord, and free themselves from the cycle of birth and death by renouncing the fruits of action \nin the material world. In this way they can attain that state beyond all miseries.
PURPORTThe liberated living entities seek that place where there are no material miseries. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam says:sam\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crit\xe2\x88\x92 ye padapallava-plava\xe2\x80\xb9mahat-pada\xe2\x80\xb9 pu\xe2\x80\x9aya-ya\xe2\x80\x9co mur\xe2\x88\x92re\xc5\xa1bh\xe2\x88\x92vambudhir vatsa-pada\xe2\x80\xb9 para\xe2\x80\xb9 pada\xe2\x80\xb9para\xe2\x80\xb9 pada\xe2\x80\xb9 yad vipad\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 na te\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92m(Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 10.14.58)\xc3\x92For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of mukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf\xc3\x95s hoofprint. Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of life.\xc3\x93Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step. Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy. They do not know that \nno kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries. The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world. But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the '
b'transcendental loving service of the Lord. Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death. To know one\xc3\x95s constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord. One who wrongly thinks that the living entity\xc3\x95s position and the Lord\xc3\x95s position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death. But one \nwho, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1haloka. Service for the cause of the Lord is called karma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.

TRANSLATION
When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.
PURPORTThere are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by '
b'devotional service to the Lord. When a person factually understands K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and his relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d M\xe2\x88\x92dhavendra Pur\xe2\x80\x9d, a great devotee and \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya in the line of the devotees, says:sandhy\xe2\x88\x92-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bho\xc5\xa1 sn\xe2\x88\x92na tubhya\xe2\x80\xb9 namobho dev\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 pitara\xe2\x80\x9c ca tarpa\xe2\x80\x9aa-vidhau n\xe2\x88\x92ha\xe2\x80\xb9 k\xc5\x92ama\xc5\xa1 k\xc5\x92amyat\xe2\x88\x92myatra kv\xe2\x88\x92pi ni\xc5\x92adya y\xe2\x88\x92dava-kulottamasya ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa-dvi\xc5\x92a\xc5\xa1sm\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\xb9 sm\xe2\x88\x92ram agha\xe2\x80\xb9 har\xe2\x88\x92mi tad ala\xe2\x80\xb9 manye kim anyena me.\xc3\x92O Lord, in my prayers three times a day, all glory to You. Bathing, I offer my obeisances unto You. O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my \ninability to offer you my respects. Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa], the enemy of Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage. I think this is sufficient for me.\xc3\x93The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, \noffering respects to the forefathers, etc. But, when one is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection. If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he has no longer to execute different types of \npenances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures. And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements. Persons in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness transcend the limit of \xe2\x80\x9cabda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upani\xc5\x92ads.

TRANSLATION
When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas, and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the Divine consciousness.
PURPORTTo say that one is in sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi is to say that one has fully realized K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; that is, one in full sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi has realized Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. The highest perfection of self-realization is to understand that one is eternally the servitor of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and that one\xc3\x95s only business is to \ndischarge one\xc3\x95s duties in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, or unflinching devotee of the Lord, should not be disturbed by the flowery language of the Vedas nor be engaged in fruitive activities for promotion to the heavenly kingdom. In K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one comes directly into communion with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus all directions from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa may be understood in that transcendental state. One is sure to achieve results by such activities and attain conclusive knowledge. One has only to carry out the orders of \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or His representative, the spiritual master.

Arjuna said: What are the symptoms of one whose consciousness is thus merged in Transcendence? How does he speak, and what is his language? How does he \nsit, and how does he walk?
PURPORTAs there are symptoms for each and every man, in terms of his particular situation, similarly one who is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious has his particular nature\xc3\x91talking, walking, thinking, feeling, etc. As a rich man has his symptoms by \nwhich he is known as a rich man, as a diseased man has his symptoms, by which he is known as diseased, or as a learned man has his symptoms, so a man in transcendental consciousness of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has specific symptoms in various dealings. One can know his specific symptoms from the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Most important is how the man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness speaks, for speech is the most important quality of any man. It is said that a fool is undiscovered as long as he does not speak, and certainly a well-dressed fool cannot be identified \nunless he speaks, but as soon as he speaks, he reveals himself at once. The immediate symptom of a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious man is that he speaks only of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and of matters relating to Him. Other symptoms then automatically follow, as stated below.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O P\xe2\x88\x92rtha, when a man gives up all varieties of sense desire which arise from mental concoction, and when his mind finds satisfaction in the self alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness.
PURPORTThe Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam affirms that any person who is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages, whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualifications, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions. Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness without \nhesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the '
b'platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
One who is not disturbed in spite of the threefold miseries, who is not elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.
PURPORTThe word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion. It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term. N\xe2\x88\x92sau munir yasya mata\xe2\x80\xb9 na binnam. But a sthita-dh\xe2\x80\x9d-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni The sthita-dh\xe2\x80\x9d-muni is always in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion '
b'that Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, is everything. He is called a muni fixed in mind. Such a fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord\xc3\x95s grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better \nservice to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one\xc3\x95s own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is always steady in his determination.

PURPORTThere is always some upheaval in the material world which may be good or evil. One who is not agitated by such material upheavals, who is unaffected by good and evil, is to be understood to be fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As long as one is in the material world there is always the possibility of good and evil because this world is full of duality. But one who is fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is not affected by good and evil because he is simply concerned with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is all good absolute. Such consciousness in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa situates one \nin a perfect transcendental position called, technically, sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi.

TRANSLATION
One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within the shell, is to be understood as truly situated in knowledge.
PURPORTThe test of a yog\xe2\x80\x9d, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan. Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses. That is the answer to the question as to how the yog\xe2\x80\x9d is situated. The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. The '
b'yog\xe2\x80\x9d, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents\xc3\x91like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independantly. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not\xc3\x95s, and some of them are do\xc3\x95s. Unless one is able to follow the do\xc3\x95s and the do-not\xc3\x95s, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes. Similarly, the senses of the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious persons are \nused only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise. Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.

TRANSLATION
The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a \nhigher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.'
b'
PURPORTUnless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, \xe2\x88\x92sana, pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92ma, praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra, dhara\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no \nbetter knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, in the course of his advancement in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. When one is actually K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.

TRANSLATION
The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control \nthem.'
b'
PURPORTThere are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind. Even Vi\xe2\x80\x9cv\xe2\x88\x92mitra, a great sage and perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d, was misled by Menak\xe2\x88\x92 into sex enjoyment, although the yog\xe2\x80\x9d was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice. And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world. Therefore, it is very difficult to \ncontrol the mind and the senses without being fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Without engaging the mind in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot cease such material engagements. A practical example is given by \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Y\xe2\x88\x92mun\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, a great saint and devotee, who says: \xc3\x92Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought.\xc3\x93\nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful. It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables. Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ambar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92a also conquered a great yog\xe2\x80\x9d, Durv\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92 Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a man of steady intelligence.
PURPORTThat the highest conception of yoga perfection is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is clearly explained in this verse. And, unless one is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses. As cited above, the great sage Durv\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92 Muni picked a quarrel with Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ambar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92a, and Durv\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92 Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses. On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a yog\xe2\x80\x9d as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage\xc3\x95s injustices and thereby emerged victorious.

b'holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord \xc3\x89 and all these qualifications made him fit to become a mat-para\xc5\xa1 devotee of the Lord.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 9.4.18-20)The word mat-para\xc5\xa1 is most significant in this connection.

The so-called yog\xe2\x80\x9ds who meditate on something which is not the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form simply waste their time in a vain search after some \nphantasmagoria. We have to be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious\xc3\x91devoted to the Personality of Godhead. This is the aim of the real yoga.

While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.'

PURPORTOne who is not K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of senses. The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x91to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets\xc3\x91is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to \nbecome K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva was deep in meditation, but when P\xe2\x88\x92rvat\xe2\x80\x9d agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result K\xe2\x88\x92rtikeya was born. When Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 Dev\xe2\x80\x9d, but Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Y\xe2\x88\x92mun\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual \nenjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.

TRANSLATION
From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool.
PURPORTBy development of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord. Those who are without knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation. On the other hand, a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not \nbecome a victim of material consciousness. For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat. Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion. So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called pras\xe2\x88\x92dam. Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall. The devotee takes pras\xe2\x88\x92dam in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, whereas the \nnondevotee rejects it as material. The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence. It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.

TRANSLATION
One who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free from \nall attachment and aversion.
PURPORTIt is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall. Although the person in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities. The K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the \nsensual platform.

TRANSLATION
One who is not in transcendental consciousness can have neither a controlled mind nor steady intelligence, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?
PURPORTUnless one is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there is no possibility of peace. So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace. Therefore, if one is not in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is certainly always in distress and is without \npeace, however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

As a boat on the water is swept away by a strong wind, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man\xc3\x95s intelligence.
PURPORTUnless all of the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord, even one of them engaged in sense gratification can deviate the devotee from the path of transcendental advancement. As mentioned in the life of Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ambar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92a, '

TRANSLATION
What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.
PURPORTThere are two classes of intelligent men. The one is intelligent in material activities for sense gratification, and the other is introspective and awake to the cultivation of self-realization. Activities of the introspective sage, or thoughtful man, are night for persons materially absorbed. Materialistic persons remain asleep in such a night due to their ignorance of self-realization. The introspective sage remains alert in the \xc3\x92night\xc3\x93 of the materialistic men. The sage feels transcendental pleasure in the gradual advancement of spiritual culture, whereas the man in materialistic activities, being asleep to self-\nrealization, dreams of varieties of sense pleasure, feeling sometimes happy and sometimes distressed in his sleeping condition. The introspective man is always indifferent to materialistic happiness and distress. He goes on with his self-realization activities undisturbed by material reaction.

A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires\xc3\x91that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever being filled but is always still\xc3\x91can alone \nachieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.
PURPORTAlthough the vast ocean is always filled with water, it is always, especially during the rainy season, being filled with much more water. But the ocean remains the same\xc3\x91steady; it is not agitated, nor does it cross beyond the limit of its brink. That is also true of a person fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification \nwill continue. The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires because of his fullness. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious man is not in need of anything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean\xc3\x91always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification. That is the proof of a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious man\xc3\x91one who has lost all inclinations for material sense \ngratification, although the desires are present. Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the '
b'ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace. Others, however, who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace. The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires. But the \nperson in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.

TRANSLATION
A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego\xc3\x91he alone can attain real peace.
PURPORTTo become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becoming K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one\xc3\x95s actual position as the eternal servitor of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming \nproprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'consciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious he fought because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa the same Arjuna fought to his best ability. Desire for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change \nthe quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92syam ida\xe2\x80\xb9 sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization\xc3\x91namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in spiritual identity. and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or greater than Him. This understanding of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the \nbasic principle of real peace.

That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.'
b'
PURPORTOne can attain K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or divine life at once, within a second\xc3\x91or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births. It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact. Kha\xc4\xb1v\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa means ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 teaches differently. Actual life begins after the \ncompletion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord \nis to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Attainment of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.Brahman is just the opposite of matter. Therefore br\xe2\x88\x92hm\xe2\x80\x9d sthiti\xc5\xa1 means \xc3\x92not on the platform of material activities.\xc3\x93 Devotional service of the Lord is accepted \nin the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as the liberated stage. Therefore, br\xe2\x88\x92hm\xe2\x80\x9d-sthiti\xc5\xa1 is liberation from material bondage.\xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dla Bhaktivinode \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur has summarized this Second Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as being the contents for the whole text. In the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the subject matters are karma-yoga, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and bhakti-yoga. In the Second Chapter karma-yoga and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga have been clearly discussed, and a glimpse of bhakti-yoga has also been given, as the contents for the complete text.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Second Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of its Contents.'

Arjuna said: O Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, O Ke\xe2\x80\x9cava, why do You urge me to engage in this ghastly warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?
PURPORTThe Supreme Personality of Godhead \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief. And the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Sometimes K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But without being trained in the philosophy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in a secluded place where one may \nacquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public. Arjuna also thought of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as to his best course of action. In answer, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa elaborately explained \nkarma-yoga, or work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, in this Third Chapter.

PURPORTIn the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, many different paths were explained, such as s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the senses by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte. This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path \nwould be necessary for action and understanding. Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. Although K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness\xc3\x91either by inertia or active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.

The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are two classes of men who realize the Self. Some are inclined to understand Him by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by \ndevotional work.
PURPORTIn the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures\xc3\x91namely s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga. In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly. S\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge \nand philosophy. The other class of men work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, \nfurthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse\xc3\x91that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa), and in this way all the senses can be \nbrought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The \nindirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Of these two, the path of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is itself the purifying '
b'process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.

TRANSLATION
Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection.
PURPORTThe renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of materialistic men. Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa). According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa, or retiring from fruitive \nactivities, one at once becomes as good as N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa. But Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa does not approve this principle. Without purification of heart, sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa is simply a disturbance to the social order. On the other hand, if someone takes to the \ntranscendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga). Svalpam apy asya dharmasya tr\xe2\x88\x92yate mahato bhay\xe2\x88\x92t. Even a '
b'slight performance of such a principle enables one to overcome great difficulties.

TRANSLATION
All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even \nfor a moment.
PURPORTIt is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active. Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move. The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, \nwhich is always active and cannot stop even for a moment. As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy. In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras. But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him. The \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam affirms this:tyaktv\xe2\x88\x92 sva-dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 cara\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92mbuja\xe2\x80\xb9 harerbhajann apakvo \xc3\x95tha patet tato yadiko v\xe2\x88\x92rtha \xe2\x88\x92pto \xc3\x95bhajat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sva-dharmata\xc5\xa1.\xc3\x92If someone takes to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him. But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras, what does it avail him if he is not K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious?\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Therefore, sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, without which \neverything is considered a failure.

TRANSLATION
One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.'
b'
PURPORTThere are many pretenders who refuse to work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness but make a show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense enjoyment. Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters. For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence. But he who makes a \nshow of being a yog\xe2\x80\x9d, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification, must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy. His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful man\xc3\x95s knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord. Such a pretender\xc3\x95s mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever.

PURPORTInstead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one\xc3\x95s own business and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God. The prime sv\xe2\x88\x92rtha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to reach Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. The whole institution of var\xe2\x80\x9aa and \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. For self-realization, one can live a \ncontrolled life, as prescribed in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras, and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress. Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living.

PURPORTThere are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed duties as set forth for k\xc5\x92atriyas. Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder k\xc5\x92atriya. Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one\xc3\x95s body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for \nsense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.

TRANSLATION
Work done as a sacrifice for Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached \nand free from bondage.
PURPORTSince one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yaj\xc5\x81a means Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or sacrificial \nperformances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. The Vedas enjoin: yaj\xc5\x81o vai vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au\xc5\xa1. In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yaj\xc5\x81as or directly serves Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is therefore performance of yaj\xc5\x81a as it is prescribed in this verse. The var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution also aims at this for \nsatisfying Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. \xc3\x92Var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cram\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ra-vat\xe2\x88\x92 puru\xc5\x92e\xe2\x80\x9aa para\xc5\xa1 pum\xe2\x88\x92n/vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aur \xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92dhyate\xc3\x89\xc3\x93 (Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the \nsatisfaction of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Any other work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore, one has to work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness to satisfy K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (or Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or under \nthe direct instruction of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work). Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.

TRANSLATION
In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and blessed them by saying, \xc3\x92Be thou happy by this yaj\xc5\x81a [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you all desirable things.\xc3\x93
PURPORTThe material creation by the Lord of creatures (Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home\xc3\x91back to Godhead. All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: vedai\xe2\x80\x9c ca sarvair aham eva vedya\xc5\xa1. The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him. In the Vedic hymns it is said: pati\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xe2\x80\x9cvasy\xe2\x88\x92tme\xe2\x80\x9cvaram. Therefore, the Lord of the \nliving entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam also \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dla \xe2\x80\xa1ukadeva Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d describes the Lord as pati in so many \nways:\xe2\x80\x9criya\xc5\xa1-patir yaj\xc5\x81a-pati\xc5\xa1 praj\xe2\x88\x92-patirdhiy\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 patir loka-patir dhar\xe2\x88\x92-pati\xc5\xa1patir gati\xe2\x80\x9c c\xe2\x88\x92ndhaka-v\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai-s\xe2\x88\x92tvat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9pras\xe2\x80\x9ddat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 me bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n sat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 pati\xc5\xa1(Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 2.4.20)'
b'The praj\xe2\x88\x92-pati is Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yaj\xc5\x81as (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, so that while in the material world \nthey can live very comfortably without anxiety. Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned soul. By performance of yaj\xc5\x81a, the conditioned souls gradually become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali, the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age. Sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness go well together. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam as follows, with special reference to the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a:k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-var\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 tvi\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81gop\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81g\xe2\x88\x92stra-p\xe2\x88\x92r\xc5\x92adamyaj\xc5\x81ai\xc5\xa1 sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-pr\xe2\x88\x92yair yajanti hi su-medhasa\xc5\xa1\xc3\x92In this age of Kali, people who are endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance \nof sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 11.5.29) Other yaj\xc5\x81as prescribed in the Vedic literatures are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, but the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a is easy and sublime for all purposes.

TRANSLATION
The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing one another, there will reign general prosperity for all.
PURPORTThe demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs. The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead. Their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yaj\xc5\x81as by the human being. Some of the yaj\xc5\x81as are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is worshiped in all yaj\xc5\x81as as the chief beneficiary. It is stated also in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nHimself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yaj\xc5\x81as: bhokt\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\xb9 yaj\xc5\x81a-tapas\xe2\x88\x92m. Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yaj\xc5\x81apati is the chief purpose of all yaj\xc5\x81as. When these yaj\xc5\x81as are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in \ncharge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.Performance of yaj\xc5\x81as has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from the material bondage. By performance of yaj\xc5\x81as, all activities become purified, as it is stated in the Vedas:\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra-\xe2\x80\x9cuddhau sattva-\xe2\x80\x9cuddhi\xc5\xa1 sattva-\xe2\x80\x9cuddhaudhruv\xe2\x88\x92 sm\xe2\x80\x9eti\xc5\xa1 sm\xe2\x80\x9eti-lambhe sarva-granth\xe2\x80\x9dn\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 vipra-mok\xc5\x92a\xc5\xa1As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yaj\xc5\x81a, one\xc3\x95s eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one\xc3\x95s very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.'

TRANSLATION
In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yaj\xc5\x81a [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man. But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly \na thief.
PURPORTThe demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yaj\xc5\x81as. In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yaj\xc5\x81as prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For one who cannot understand what \nthe Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yaj\xc5\x81as are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis\xc3\x91namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess K\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x80\x9d, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the '
b'transcendental worship of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is recommended. But ultimately, all yaj\xc5\x81as are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yaj\xc5\x81as, known as pa\xc5\x81ca-mah\xe2\x88\x92yaj\xc5\x81a, are necessary.One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord. No one can manufacture anything. Take, for example, all the eatables of human society. These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like \nmeats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men. Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life!none of them can be manufactured by the human society. Without the Supreme Lord, \nthere can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live. Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the Lord. Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials!all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence. This aim of life is attained by performance of yaj\xc5\x81as. If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of \ncreation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature. A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life. The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life. They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yaj\xc5\x81as. Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yaj\xc5\x81a, namely the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for personal \nsense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.
PURPORTThe devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92: prem\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81jana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santa\xc5\xa1 sadaiva h\xe2\x80\x9edaye\xc5\x92u vilokayanti. The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all \npleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yaj\xc5\x81as in different modes of devotional service, such as \xe2\x80\x9crava\xe2\x80\x9aam, k\xe2\x80\x9drtanam, smara\xe2\x80\x9aam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yaj\xc5\x81as keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves, but are also the eaters \nof all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a, in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in \nthe world.'

TRANSLATION
All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain. Rains are produced by performance of yaj\xc5\x81a [sacrifice], and yaj\xc5\x81a is born of prescribed duties.
PURPORTBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, writes as follows: ye indr\xe2\x88\x92dy-a\xef\xac\x81ga-tay\xe2\x88\x92vasthita\xe2\x80\xb9 yaj\xc5\x81a\xe2\x80\xb9 sarve\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aum abhyarccya tacche\xc5\x92am a\xe2\x80\x9cnanti tena taddeha-y\xe2\x88\x92ntr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 samp\xe2\x88\x92dayanti te santa\xc5\xa1 sarve\xe2\x80\x9cvarasya bhakt\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 sarva-kilvi\xc5\x92air an\xe2\x88\x92di-k\xe2\x88\x92la-viv\xe2\x80\x9eddhair \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92nubhava- pratibandhakair nikhilai\xc5\xa1 p\xe2\x88\x92pair vimucyante. The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yaj\xc5\x81a-puru\xc5\x92a\xc5\xa1, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varu\xe2\x80\x9aa, etc., are appointed officers who \nmanage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the '
b'Lord, who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, offer food to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and then eat\xc3\x91a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, who eats only food offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting pras\xe2\x88\x92dam of the Lord (food offered to Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au) is saved from the \nattack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big \nfactories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity!that is the law of nature. Yaj\xc5\x81a, specifically the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.

TRANSLATION
Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.
PURPORTYaj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92rtha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa only, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yaj\xc5\x81a-puru\xc5\x92a, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of \nworking directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always \ntake direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said: \nveda\xc5\xa1 s\xe2\x88\x92ma-vedo \xc3\x95tharv\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81 girasa\xc5\xa1. \xc3\x92The four Vedas\xc3\x91namely the \xe2\x80\xa0g-veda, Yajur-veda, S\xe2\x88\x92ma-veda and Atharva-veda\xc3\x91are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\xc3\x93 The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, for the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material '
b'nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one\xc3\x95s perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow \nthe process of yaj\xc5\x81a by becoming K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Even those who cannot follow the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yaj\xc5\x81as, or karmas.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the senses lives in vain.'
b'
PURPORTThe mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is condemned herein by the Lord. Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yaj\xc5\x81as is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, \nbeing condemned more and more. By nature\xc3\x95s law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways\xc3\x91namely karma-yoga, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, or bhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly \nfollowing the performances of the prescribed yaj\xc5\x81as for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yaj\xc5\x81a performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. The yaj\xc5\x81a system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the \nreaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yaj\xc5\x81as are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yaj\xc5\x81as, one is sure to become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. But if by performing yaj\xc5\x81as one does not become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. \nOne should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One who is, however, taking pleasure in the self, who is illumined in the self, who rejoices in and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated\xc3\x91for him there is no duty.
PURPORTA person who is fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, and is fully satisfied by his acts in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, no longer has any duty to perform. Due to his being K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, all impiety within is instantly cleansed, an effect of many, many thousands of yaj\xc5\x81a performances. By such clearing of consciousness, one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord, and \ntherefore he no longer has any obligations to the Vedic injunctions. Such a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations.

A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being.
PURPORTA self-realized man is no longer obliged to perform any prescribed duty, save and except activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is not inactivity either, as will be explained in the following verses.

Whatever he does in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is sufficient in the discharge of his obligation.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty; for by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.'

PURPORTThe Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees, and liberation for the impersonalist. A person, therefore, acting for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work, is certainly making progress toward the supreme goal of life. Arjuna is told that he should fight in the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra for the interest of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme is to act without \nattachment for the result. That is perfect action of the highest degree, recommended by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Vedic rituals, like prescribed sacrifices, are performed for purification of impious activities that were performed in the field of sense gratification. But action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is transcendental to the reactions of good or evil work. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has no attachment for the result but acts on behalf of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa alone. He engages in all kinds of activities, but is completely \nnonattached.

TRANSLATION
Even kings like Janaka and others attained the perfectional stage by performance of prescribed duties. Therefore, just for the sake of educating the people in general, you should perform your work.
PURPORTKings like Janaka and others were all self-realized souls; consequently they had no obligation to perform the prescribed duties in the Vedas. Nonetheless they performed all prescribed activities just to set examples for the people in general. Janaka was the father of S\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, and father-in-law of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d R\xe2\x88\x92ma. Being a great devotee of the Lord, he was transcendentally situated, but because he was the King of Mithila (a subdivision of Behar province in India), \nhe had to teach his subjects how to fight righteously in battle. He and his subjects fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach \nthe public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse.

TRANSLATION
Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world \npursues.
PURPORTPeople in general always require a leader who can teach the public by practical behavior. A leader cannot teach the public to stop smoking if he himself smokes. Lord Caitanya said that a teacher should behave properly even before he begins teaching. One who teaches in that way is called \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, or the ideal teacher. Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ctra (scripture) to reach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, like \nManu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader\xc3\x95s teaching should be based on the principles of the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. The \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam also affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in \ngeneral. All such natural leaders have a great responsibility to their dependants; therefore they must be conversant with standard books of moral and spiritual codes.

Everyone is under His control. All entities are delegated with particular power only by the Supreme Lord; they are not supreme themselves. He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the \nsupreme director of all directors. Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all. There is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.'
b'\xc3\x92He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity. There is no difference between His body and His soul. He is absolute. All His senses are transcendental. Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other sense. Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him. His potencies are multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural sequence.\xc3\x93 (\xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad 6.7\xc3\x908)Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead \nto perform. One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty. And yet Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is engaged on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra as the leader of the k\xc5\x92atriyas because the k\xc5\x92atriyas are duty-bound to give protection to the distressed. Although He is above all the regulations of the revealed scriptures, He does not do anything that violates the revealed scriptures.

If I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination. I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings.
PURPORTVar\xe2\x80\x9aa-sa\xef\xac\x81kara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society. In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become \npeaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life. When Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances. The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord. Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society. We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him. Following and imitating are not on the same level. We \ncannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood. It is impossible for any human being. We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time. The \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam affirms:naitat sam\xe2\x88\x92carej j\xe2\x88\x92tu manas\xe2\x88\x92pi hy an\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1vina\xe2\x80\x9cyaty \xe2\x88\x92caran mau\xc5\xb8hy\xe2\x88\x92d yath\xe2\x88\x92 \xc3\x95rudro \xc3\x95bdhija\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xc5\x92am\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvar\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 vaca\xc5\xa1 satya\xe2\x80\xb9 tathaiv\xe2\x88\x92carita\xe2\x80\xb9 kvacitte\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 yat sva-vaco yukta\xe2\x80\xb9 buddhim\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9s tat sam\xe2\x88\x92caret\xc3\x92One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered servants. Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person will perform them as instructed. However, one should guard against trying to imitate their actions. One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 10.33.30)We should always consider the position of the \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior. Without such power, one cannot imitate the \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvaras, who are superpowerful. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed. There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva who want to indulge in smoking g\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81j\xe2\x88\x92 (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the \nacts of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva they are calling death very near. Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa who prefer to imitate the Lord in His r\xe2\x88\x92sa-l\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x88\x92, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill. It is best, \ntherefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification. There are so many \xc3\x92incarnations\xc3\x93 of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.'

Therefore, the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is required to show the people how to act and how to engage the results of action for the purpose of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness.

TRANSLATION
Let not the wise disrupt the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive action. They should not be encouraged to refrain from work, but to engage in \nwork in the spirit of devotion.
PURPORTVedai\xe2\x80\x9c ca sarvair aham eva vedya\xc5\xa1: that is the end of all Vedic rituals. All rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the Vedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is the ultimate goal of life. But because the conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study \nthe Vedas to that end. Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually elevated to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Therefore a realized soul in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The learned K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave. Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in \nhis activities, still, a slightly developed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas. For this fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the prescribed duties of a particular person.'

The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature.
PURPORTTwo persons, one in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and the other in material consciousness, working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything independantly, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does \nnot know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such his bodily and mental activities should be engaged in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, or the master of the senses of the material '
b'body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
One who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth, O mighty-armed, does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification, knowing well the differences between work in devotion and work for fruitive results.
PURPORTThe knower of the Absolute Truth is convinced of his awkward position in material association. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and that his position should not be in the material creation. He knows his real identity as part and parcel of the Supreme, who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and he realizes that somehow or other he is entrapped in the material conception of life. In his pure state of \nexistence he is meant to dovetail his activities in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He therefore engages himself in the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and becomes naturally unattached to the '
b'activities of the material senses, which are all circumstantial and temporary. He knows that his material condition of life is under the supreme control of the Lord; consequently he is not disturbed by all kinds of material reactions, which he considers to be the mercy of the Lord. According to \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, one who knows the Absolute Truth in three different features\xc3\x91\nnamely Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead\xc3\x91is called tattvavit, for he knows also his own factual position in relationship with the Supreme.

Bewildered by the modes of material nature, the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and become attached. But the wise should not \nunsettle them, although these duties are inferior due to the performers\xc3\x95 lack of \nknowledge.
PURPORTPersons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations. This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness '
b'is called mand\xe2\x88\x92n, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul. Ignorant men think of the body as the self; bodily connections with others are accepted as kinsmanship; the land in which the body is obtained is the object of worship; and the formalities of religious rituals are considered ends in themselves. Social work, nationalism, and altruism are some of the activities for such materially designated persons. Under the spell of such designations, they are always busy in the material field; for them spiritual realization is a myth, and so they are not interested. Such bewildered persons may even be \nengaged in such primary moral principles of life as nonviolence and similar materially benevolent work. Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons. Better to prosecute one\xc3\x95s own spiritual activities silently.Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and therefore Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time. But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord \nbecause they understand the purpose of the Lord. Consequently they undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human being.

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on Me, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.
PURPORTThis verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The Lord instructs that one has to become fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord. Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for \nthe good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship. Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, is called adhy\xe2\x88\x92tma-cetas\xe2\x88\x92. Nir\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1 means that one has to act on the order of the master. Nor should one ever expect fruitive results. The cashier \nmay count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me. And when one acts in such K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine. And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of so-\ncalled kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation.'

TRANSLATION
One who executes his duties according to My injunctions and who follows this teaching faithfully, without envy, becomes free from the bondage of fruitive actions.
PURPORTThe injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without exception. As the Vedas are eternal, so this truth of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is also eternal. One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord. There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 but have no faith in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated \nfrom the bondage of the law of karma. In the beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one may not fully discharge the injunctions of the Lord, but because one is not resentful of this principle and works sincerely without consideration of defeat and hopelessness, he will surely be promoted to the stage of pure K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.'

But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.
PURPORTThe flaw of not being K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is clearly stated herein. As there is punishment for disobedience to the order of the supreme executive head, so there is certainly punishment for the disobedience of the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A disobedient person, however great he may be, is ignorant of his own self, of the Supreme Brahman, and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and the Personality of Godhead, due to a vacant heart. Therefore there is no hope of perfection of life for him.

TRANSLATION
Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows his nature. What can repression accomplish?
PURPORTUnless one is situated on the transcendental platform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature which they are \nunable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties. Therefore, without being fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yog\xe2\x80\x9d or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one\xc3\x95s position and to try to attain K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness under \nsuperior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92.'

TRANSLATION
Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.
PURPORTThose who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratifications. But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. For example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one\xc3\x95s wife. All other \nwomen are to be considered as one\xc3\x95s mother. But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we '
b'should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astray\xc3\x91as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; \ntherefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But action in the loving service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
It is far better to discharge one\xc3\x95s prescribed duties, even though they may be faulty, than another\xc3\x95s duties. Destruction in the course of performing one\xc3\x95s own '
b'duty is better than engaging in another\xc3\x95s duties, for to follow another\xc3\x95s path is dangerous.
PURPORTOne should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Prescribed duties complement one\xc3\x95s psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another\xc3\x95s prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material \nplatform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and should not imitate others. For example, a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a k\xc5\x92atriya, who is in the mode of \npassion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for a k\xc5\x92atriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa who follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the k\xc5\x92atriya may act as a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, or a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa may act as a k\xc5\x92atriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example, Vi\xe2\x80\x9cv\xe2\x88\x92mitra \nwas originally a k\xc5\x92atriya, but later on he acted as a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, whereas Para\xe2\x80\x9cur\xe2\x88\x92ma was a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, but later on he acted as a k\xc5\x92atriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.'

Arjuna said: O descendant of V\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai, by what is one impelled to sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if engaged by force?
PURPORTA living entity, as part and parcel of the Supreme, is originally spiritual, pure, and free from all material contaminations. Therefore, by nature he is not subjected to the sins of the material world. But when he is in contact with the material nature, he acts in many sinful ways without hesitation, and sometimes even against his will. As such, Arjuna\xc3\x95s question to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very sanguine, as to the perverted nature of the living entities. Although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act. Sinful actions \nare not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the \nall-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.
PURPORTWhen a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into \nlust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt. Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of \nbeing degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of '
b'goodness by the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss. They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust. This material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these \nlustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.This inquiry is the beginning of the wherein it is said, ath\xe2\x88\x92to brahma-jij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92: one should inquire into the Supreme. And the Supreme is defined in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam as janm\xe2\x88\x92dyasya yato \xc3\x95nvay\xe2\x88\x92d itarata\xe2\x80\x9c ca, or, "The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman." Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the Supreme. If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the \nSupreme, or transformed into K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness!or, in other words, desiring everything for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa!then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized. \nHanum\xe2\x88\x92n, the great servitor of Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord. Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, become our friends instead of our \nenemies.

TRANSLATION
As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different degrees of this lust.
PURPORTThere are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits his K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire \ncovered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to \nthat of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in \nthe fire, the fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness under able guidance.

TRANSLATION
Thus, a man\xc3\x95s pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.
PURPORTIt is said in the Manu-sm\xe2\x80\x9eti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of fuel. In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this material world is called maithu\xe2\x80\x9aya-\xe2\x88\x92g\xe2\x88\x92ra, or the shackles of sex life. In the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life. Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore, this lust is the \nsymbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.

The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust, which veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.
PURPORTThe enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul, and therefore Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is giving hints of those places, so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found. Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit \nsoul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam:yasy\xe2\x88\x92tma-buddhi\xc5\xa1 ku\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92pe tri-dh\xe2\x88\x92tukesva-dh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1 kalatr\xe2\x88\x92di\xc5\x92u bhauma idyadh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1yat-t\xe2\x80\x9drtha-buddhi\xc5\xa1 salite na karhicijjane\xc5\x92v abhij\xc5\x81e\xc5\x92u sa eva gokhara\xc5\xa1."A human being who identifies this body made of three elements with his self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of birth as worshipable, and who goes to the place of '

TRANSLATION
Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization.
PURPORTThe Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for self-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self. J\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body. Vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of one\xc3\x95s constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul. It is explained thus in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam: j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na\xe2\x80\xb9 parama-guhya\xe2\x80\xb9 me yad-vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-samanvitam / sarahasya\xe2\x80\xb9 \ntad-a\xef\xac\x81ga\xe2\x80\xb9 ca g\xe2\x80\x9eh\xe2\x88\x92na gadita\xe2\x80\xb9 may\xe2\x88\x92: "The knowledge of the self and the \nSupreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, being veiled by m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, but '
b'such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself." Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self. The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord. This consciousness is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and thereby one may become fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious and act accordingly.Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for \nevery living entity. But if one is educated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust. When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition. Nonetheless, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service. So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead!the highest perfectional stage of human life.

TRANSLATION
The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.
PURPORTThe senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the \nSupreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act\xc3\x91as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. \nIn the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad the soul has been \ndescribed as mah\xe2\x88\x92n, the great. Therefore the soul is above all\xc3\x91namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from '
b'the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one\xc3\x95s mind in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.

TRANSLATION
Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and intelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus\xc3\x91by spiritual strength\xc3\x91conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.
PURPORTThis Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is conclusively directive to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate end. In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by \npropensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material '
b'nature. Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind\xc3\x91by steady intelligence directed toward one\xc3\x95s pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and \nartificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by higher intelligence.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Third Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or the Discharge of One\xc3\x95s Prescribed Duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Consciousness.'

The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, and Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku.
PURPORTHerein we find the history of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and \ndevotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated:yac-cak\xc5\x92ur e\xc5\x92a savit\xe2\x88\x92 sakala-grah\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9yasy\xe2\x88\x92j\xc5\x81ay\xe2\x88\x92 bhramati sambh\xe2\x80\x9eta-k\xe2\x88\x92lacakrogovindam \xe2\x88\x92di-puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 tam aha\xe2\x80\xb9 bhaj\xe2\x88\x92mi"Let me worship," Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 said, "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat. The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order."'
b'The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light. He is rotating under the order of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa originally made Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial. In the Mah\xe2\x88\x92bh\xe2\x88\x92rata (\xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x88\x92nti-parva 348.51\xc3\x9052) we can trace out the history of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as follows:tret\xe2\x88\x92-yug\xe2\x88\x92dau ca tato vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n manave dadaumanu\xe2\x80\x9c ca loka-bh\xe2\x80\x9ety-artha\xe2\x80\xb9 sut\xe2\x88\x92yek\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92kave dadauik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 ca kathito vy\xe2\x88\x92pya lok\xe2\x88\x92n avasthit\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1"In the beginning of the Tret\xe2\x88\x92-yuga [millennium] this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n to Manu. Manu, \nbeing the father of mankind, gave it to his son Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku, the King of \nthis earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord R\xe2\x88\x92macandra appeared. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 existed in the human society from the time of Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku."At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years. Before this there was Dv\xe2\x88\x92para-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Tret\xe2\x88\x92-yuga (1,200,000 years). Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 to his disciple and \nson Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja lk\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku, the King of this planet earth. The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed. Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, a rough estimate is that the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been \nextant for two million years. It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago. That is the rough estimate of the history of the \nG\xe2\x80\x9dta, according to the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n because he is also a k\xc5\x92atriya and is the father of all k\xc5\x92atriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the Because Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauru\xc5\x92eya, superhuman. Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 must therefore be accepted '
b'without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as it is. Therefore, Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku.

TRANSLATION
This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of \ntime the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.
PURPORTIt is clearly stated that the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one\xc3\x95s benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to '
b'reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic \nsuccession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, although they make a good business on the \nwords of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in English, as it is received by the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x91accepted as it is\xc3\x91is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time.

b'
PURPORTThere are two classes of men, namely the devotee and the demon. The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science. There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons. Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless. Arjuna accepts \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the \nSupreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great \nscience. The demonic, however, concoct something about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and mislead the public and general readers from the path of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s instructions. One should try to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.

Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?'
b'
PURPORTArjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence. Of course, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also appeared as the son of Devak\xe2\x80\x9d on this earth. How K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa so that He Himself could speak authoritatively. That K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but \nfrom time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, since K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nHimself may appear to be strange because the demons always study K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa when they are spoken by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who consider K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha\xc3\x91the eternal form of bliss and \nknowledge\xc3\x91that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Arjuna\xc3\x95s putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of '
b'persons who consider K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.

PURPORTIn the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. lt is stated there:\xe2\x88\x92dya\xe2\x80\xb9 pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 nava-yauvana\xe2\x80\xb9 cavede\xc5\x92u durllabham adurllabham \xe2\x88\x92tma-bhaktaugovindam \xe2\x88\x92di-puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 tam aha\xe2\x80\xb9 bhaj\xe2\x88\x92mi.(Bs. 5.33)'
b'"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa], who is the original person\xc3\x91absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees." It is also stated in Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92:n\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92vat\xe2\x88\x92ram akarod bhuvane\xc5\x92u kintuk\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 svaya\xe2\x80\xb9 samabhavat parama\xc5\xa1 pum\xe2\x88\x92n yogovindam \xe2\x88\x92di-puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 tam aha\xe2\x80\xb9 bhaj\xe2\x88\x92mi(Bs. 5.39)"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9ha and many sub-\nincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and who incarnates personally also."In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidurya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multi-forms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas: vede\xc5\x92u durllabham adurllabham \xe2\x88\x92tma-bhaktau. Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood \nthat some millions of years ago when Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa spoke the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 to the sun-god Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But \nthe difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, \na living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is '
b'described in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 cannot be understood by demonic \nbrains. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit\xc3\x91whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And, \nbecause the Lord\xc3\x95s body and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, as the Lord explains in the following verse.

TRANSLATION
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.
PURPORTThe Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past "births," whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before. If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was \ndoing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains His prak\xe2\x80\x9eti or His form. Prak\xe2\x80\x9eti means nature as well as or one\xc3\x95s own form. The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material \nworld, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary \nliving entity. Despite the fact Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation\xc3\x91past, present, and \nfuture. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. '
b'Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun\xc3\x95s rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun \nin the sky. And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency\xc3\x91and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change \nof body. In the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, He appears before His mother as N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Vi\xe2\x80\x9cvako\xe2\x80\x9ca dictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities \nwhile He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse.

PURPORTThe word s\xe2\x80\x9ej\xe2\x88\x92mi is significant herein. S\xe2\x80\x9ej\xe2\x88\x92mi cannot be used in the sense of creation. because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord\xc3\x95s form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore s\xe2\x80\x9ej\xe2\x88\x92mi means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of Dv\xe2\x88\x92para-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, still He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true \nreligion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, from within \nhis heart. Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 tu s\xe2\x88\x92k\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92t-bhagavat-\npra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9dtam). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing \nmore. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears. From the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were '
b'using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and every avat\xe2\x88\x92ra, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as an avat\xe2\x88\x92ra unless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that \nthe Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same\xc3\x91to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some \ndisguised form.The principles of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world. Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the beginner\xc3\x95s arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well. Still, there are higher and lower mathematics. In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are \ntaught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances. The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later. The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness everywhere. Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.

PURPORTAccording to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, a s\xe2\x88\x92dhu (holyman) is a man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a s\xe2\x88\x92dhu. And du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etam applies to one who doesn't care for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Such miscreants, or du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etam, are described as foolish and the \nlowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is accepted as s\xe2\x88\x92dhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa and Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to \nappease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. Although Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja was the son of Hira\xe2\x80\x9ayaka\xe2\x80\x9cipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, the mother of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, was the sister of Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was to be born of them. So Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appeared primarily to deliver Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, rather than kill Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa, but both were performed "
b'simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aad\xe2\x88\x92sa Kavir\xe2\x88\x92ja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92tita paravyome sav\xe2\x88\x92ra avasth\xe2\x88\x92navi\xe2\x80\x9cve \xc3\x94avat\xe2\x88\x92ri\xc3\x95 dhare \xc3\x94avat\xe2\x88\x92ra\xc3\x95 n\xe2\x88\x92ma."The avat\xe2\x88\x92ra, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation. And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avat\xe2\x88\x92ra. Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God. When \nthey descend to the material creation, they assume the name avat\xe2\x88\x92ra."There are various kinds of avat\xe2\x88\x92ras, such as puru\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92vat\xe2\x88\x92ras, gu\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92vat\xe2\x88\x92ras, l\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x88\x92vat\xe2\x88\x92ras, \xe2\x80\x9cakty\xe2\x88\x92ve\xe2\x80\x9ca avat\xe2\x88\x92ras, manvantara-avat\xe2\x88\x92ras and yug\xe2\x88\x92vat\xe2\x88\x92ras\xc3\x91all appearing on schedule all over the universe. But Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avat\xe2\x88\x92ras. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana pastimes. Therefore, the prime purpose of the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa avat\xe2\x88\x92ra is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium. This indicates \nthat He incarnates also in the age of Kali. As stated in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, \nwho spread the worship of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness throughout India. He predicted that this culture of sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village. Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not \ndirectly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upani\xc5\x92ads, Mah\xe2\x88\x92bh\xe2\x88\x92rata, Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, etc. The devotees of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are much attracted by the sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana movement of Lord Caitanya. This avat\xe2\x88\x92ra of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.'

TRANSLATION
One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.
PURPORTThe Lord\xc3\x95s descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve\xc3\x91merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord\xc3\x91is only \npartial, and there is the risk of returning again to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again to this material world. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: '
b'Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas:eko devo nitya-l\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x88\x92nurakto bhakta-vy\xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x80\x9d h\xe2\x80\x9edy antar\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92."The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees." This \nVedic version is confirmed in this verse of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 personally by the Lord. He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in \nphilosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation. Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation. The Vedic version, "tattvamasi," is actually applied in this case. \nAnyone who understands Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, "You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead" is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed. In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:tam eva viditv\xe2\x88\x92tim\xe2\x80\x9etyumeti n\xe2\x88\x92nya\xc5\xa1 panth\xe2\x88\x92 vidyate ayan\xe2\x88\x92ya.One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no \nalternative because anyone who does not understand Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance. Consequently he will not attain salvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 \naccording to mundane scholarship. Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation. Such puffed up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord. One should therefore cultivate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.'

TRANSLATION
Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purifled by knowledge of Me\xc3\x91and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me.
PURPORTAs described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material \nmanifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind '
b'of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme \ncause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of \nattachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is called bh\xe2\x88\x92va, or transcendental love of Godhead.According to Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:\xe2\x88\x92dau \xe2\x80\x9craddh\xe2\x88\x92 tata\xc5\xa1 s\xe2\x88\x92dhu-sa\xef\xac\x81go \xc3\x95tha bhajana-kriy\xe2\x88\x92tato \xc3\x95nartha-niv\xe2\x80\x9etti\xc5\xa1 sy\xe2\x88\x92t tato ni\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1h\xe2\x88\x92 rucis tata\xc5\xa1ath\xe2\x88\x92saktis tato bh\xe2\x88\x92vas tata\xc5\xa1 prem\xe2\x88\x92bhyuda\xc5\x81catis\xe2\x88\x92dhak\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m aya\xe2\x80\xb9 prem\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 pr\xe2\x88\x92durbh\xe2\x88\x92ve bhavet krama\xc5\xa1."In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization. This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are \nspiritually elevated. In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service. By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This taste leads one further forward to attachment for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, which is matured '
b'in bh\xe2\x88\x92va, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God. Real love for God is called prem\xe2\x88\x92, the highest perfectional stage of life." In the prem\xe2\x88\x92 stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one\xc3\x95s individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy. Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.

All of them\xc3\x91as they surrender unto Me\xc3\x91I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92.
PURPORTEveyone is searching for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in the different aspects of His manifestations. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is only fully realized by His pure devotees. Consequently, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the object of everyone\xc3\x95s realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied '
b'according to one\xc3\x95s desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may want K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode \nassociate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished \ntheir individuality. Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yaj\xc5\x81e\xe2\x80\x9cvara; and those who are yog\xe2\x80\x9ds seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy \nalone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam:ak\xe2\x88\x92ma\xc5\xa1 sarva-k\xe2\x88\x92mo v\xe2\x88\x92 mok\xc5\x92a-k\xe2\x88\x92ma ud\xe2\x88\x92radh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1t\xe2\x80\x9dvre\xe2\x80\x9aa bhakti-yogena yajeta puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 param"Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts \ntry to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness."

TRANSLATION
Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.
PURPORTThere is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord. Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God\xc3\x95s different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nity\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m: God is one. \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1. The Supreme God is one\n\xc3\x91K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nity\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m) with \ndifferent grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God\xc3\x91N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or p\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x80\x9d. Even the great demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva (\xe2\x80\x9civa-viri\xc5\x81ci-nutam). '
b'Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism. Iha devat\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. But N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. Even \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dp\xe2\x88\x92da \xe2\x80\xa1a\xef\xac\x81kar\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (h\xe2\x80\x9et-a\xc5\x81jana) worship the demigods because they want immediate \nresults. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their \nworshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns" in order to \nachieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.

TRANSLATION
According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am \nthe creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable.
PURPORTThe Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative \nclass, technically called the k\xc5\x92atriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vai\xe2\x80\x9cyas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four \ndivisions of human society, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to \ndifferent modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, however, is above even the '
b'br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, because a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, becomes a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness\xc3\x91or, in other words, a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, namely R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9ha, Var\xe2\x88\x92ha, etc. However, as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is transcendental to this system of \nthe four divisions of human society, a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.

TRANSLATION
There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work.'
b'
PURPORTAs there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world. He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources. The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right \nand wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires \nthe low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth. Vedic sm\xe2\x80\x9eti confirms this fact as follows:nimitta-m\xe2\x88\x92tram ev\xe2\x88\x92sau s\xe2\x80\x9ejy\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sarga-karma\xe2\x80\x9aiIn the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause. The immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is \nvisible. The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities. The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never \nresponsible for their past and present activities. In the it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity. The living entity \nis responsible for his own acts. The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy. Anyone who is fully '
b'conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities. In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma. One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction. But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a \nliberated soul fixed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so attained liberation. Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty in this divine consciousness.
PURPORTThere are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are '
b'full of dirty things can take to the line of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefitted. Foolish persons or neophytes in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Arjuna\xc3\x95s desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from \nthe activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Arjuna is here advised to act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord\xc3\x95s previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art \nfrom the Lord some millions of years before.

Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction. Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated from all sins.
PURPORTAction in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of previous bona fide devotees. This is recommended in the 15th verse. Why such action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.To act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning \nof this chapter. The system of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Ik\xc5\x92v\xe2\x88\x92ku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time. Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession. Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness directly. \nBecause of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge. Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself. Dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 hi s\xe2\x88\x92k\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92t-bhagavat-pra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9dtam. No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation. One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva, N\xe2\x88\x92rada, Manu, Kum\xe2\x88\x92ra, \nKapila, Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da, Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, \xe2\x80\xa1ukadeva Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d, Yamar\xe2\x88\x92ja, Janaka, etc. By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization. Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is. Only action performed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.'

TRANSLATION
The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.
PURPORTIf one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions. One has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter. To understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and action according to the modes, one has to learn one\xc3\x95s \nrelationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is the eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The entire Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are vikarmas, or prohibitive actions. To understand all this one has to associate with authorities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is as good as learning from the Lord directly. Otherwise, \neven the most intelligent person will be bewildered.'

TRANSLATION
One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among men, and he is in the tranecendental position, although engaged in all sorts of activities.
PURPORTA person acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is naturally free from the bonds of karma. His activities are all performed for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore he does not enjoy or suffer any of the effects of work. Consequently he is intelligent in human society, even though he is engaged in all sorts of activities for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Akarma means without reaction to work. The impersonalist ceases fruitive activities \nout of fear, so that the resultant action may not be a stumbling block on the path of self-realization, but the personalist knows rightly his position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore he engages \nhimself in the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Because everything is done for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he enjoys only transcendental happiness in the discharge of this service. Those who are engaged in this process are known to be without desire for personal sense gratification. The sense of eternal servitorship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa makes one immune to all sorts of reactionary elements of work.'

TRANSLATION
One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every act is devoid of desire for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive action is burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge.
PURPORTOnly a person in full knowledge can understand the activities of a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Because the person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is devoid of all kinds of sense-gratificatory propensities, it is to be understood that he has burned up the reactions of his work by perfect knowledge of his constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is actually learned who has attained to such perfection of knowledge. Development of this knowledge of the eternal servitorship of the Lord is compared to fire. Such a fire, once kindled, can burn up all kinds of reactions \nto work.

TRANSLATION
Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and independant, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of \nundertakings.
PURPORTThis freedom from the bondage of actions is possible only in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness when one is doing everything for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person acts out of pure love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he has no attraction for the results of the action. He is not even attached to his personal maintenance, for everything is left to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Nor is he \nanxious to secure things, nor to protect things already in his possession. He does his duty to his best ability and leaves everything to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such an unattached person is always free from the resultant reactions of good and bad; it is as though he were not doing anything. This is the sign of akarma, or actions without fruitive reactions. Any other action, therefore, devoid of \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is binding upon the worker, and that is the real aspect of vikarma, as explained hereinbefore.

TRANSLATION
Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by sinful reactions.
PURPORTA K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person does not expect good or bad results in his activities. His mind and intelligence are fully controlled. He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme, and therefore the part played by him, as a part and parcel of the whole, is not his by choice but is chosen for him by the Supreme and is done only through His agency. When the hand moves, it does not move out of its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for personal sense gratification. He moves exactly like a part of a \nmachine. As a machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, similarly, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. He is therefore immune to all the reactions of his endeavors. Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over his own body. A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his possession, yet the animal does not protest. Nor does it have any real independence. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, fully \nengaged in self-realization, has very little time to falsely possess any material object. For maintaining body and soul, he does not require unfair means of '
b'accumulating money. He does not, therefore, become contaminated by such material sins. He is free from all reactions to his actions.

TRANSLATION
He who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from duality and does not envy, who is steady both in success and failure, is never entangled, although performing actions.
PURPORTA K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body. He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord. He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor. He is therefore independant in his livelihood. He does not allow anyone\xc3\x95s service to hamper his own service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. However, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world. The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, or misery and happiness. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is above duality \nbecause he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. '
b'Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure. These signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge.

The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence.
PURPORTBecoming fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes. He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; and thus his mind cannot be drawn from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Consequently, whatever he does, he does for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is the primeval Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the \nSupreme Person, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.'

A person who is fully absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same \nspiritual nature.
PURPORTHow activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the \nmaterial atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness as set forth here in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. This process is generally known as yaj\xc5\x81a, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of '
b'Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The more the activities of the material world are performed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or for Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. Brahman means spiritual. The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the consuming agent of \nsuch an offering or contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are\xc3\x91all combined together\xc3\x91Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered by m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 is called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, it is said to be in sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi, or trance. Anything done in such \ntranscendental consciousness is called yaj\xc5\x81a, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain\xc3\x91everything\xc3\x91becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman. That is the method of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Some yog\xe2\x80\x9ds perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some of them offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.
PURPORTAs described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is also called a perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d or a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factual sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, who is also known as Yaj\xc5\x81a. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed \nby the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara-v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences \nby merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme '
b'Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman. The K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self\xc3\x91everything\xc3\x91is sacrificed for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus, he is the first-class yog\xe2\x80\x9d; but he does not lose his individual existence.

TRANSLATION
Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound, in the fire of sacrifice.
PURPORTThe four divisions of human life, namely the brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d, the g\xe2\x80\x9ehastha, the v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha, and the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, are all meant to help men become perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9ds or transcendentalists. Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9ds, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining \nfrom sense gratification. They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind. A '
b'brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d hears only words concerning K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d engages fully in harer n\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92nuk\xe2\x80\x9drtanam\xc3\x91chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. \nHe restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not \nindulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications. Marriage on principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yaj\xc5\x81a because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.

PURPORTThe yoga system conceived by Pata\xc5\x81jali is referred to herein. In the Yoga- of Pata\xc5\x81jali, the soul is called pratyag-\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and parag-\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The P\xe2\x88\x92ta\xc5\x81jala system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body\xc3\x95s air in a technical \nmanner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable \nfor purifying the soul of material attachment. According to this yoga system, pratyag \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is the ultimate goal. This pratyag \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is a withdrawal from \nactivities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of the pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-v\xe2\x88\x92yu. The ap\xe2\x88\x92na-v\xe2\x88\x92yu goes downwards, vy\xe2\x88\x92na-v\xe2\x88\x92yu acts to shrink and expand, sam\xe2\x88\x92na-v\xe2\x88\x92yu adjusts equilibrium, \nud\xe2\x88\x92na-v\xe2\x88\x92yu goes upwards\xc3\x91and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.

TRANSLATION
There are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in severe austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold mysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental knowledge.
PURPORTThese sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharma\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x88\x92, anna-k\xc5\x92etra, atithi-\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92l\xe2\x88\x92, anathalaya, vidy\xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x80\x9d\xc4\xb1ha, etc. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and \nmedical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yaj\xc5\x81a. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candr\xe2\x88\x92yana and c\xe2\x88\x92turm\xe2\x88\x92sya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under the c\xe2\x88\x92turm\xe2\x88\x92sya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a \nday and does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yaj\xc5\x81a. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Pata\xc5\x81jali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga or a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga (for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are called yoga-yaj\xc5\x81a, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different \nVedic literatures, specifically the Upani\xc5\x92ads and or the s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy. All of these are called sv\xe2\x88\x92dhy\xe2\x88\x92ya-yaj\xc5\x81a, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yog\xe2\x80\x9ds are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is, however, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the '
b'Lord and His bona fide devotee. Therefore, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is transcendental.

TRANSLATION
And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at \nlast remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.
PURPORTThis system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92ma, and in the beginning it is practiced in the ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga system through different sitting postures. All of these processes are recommended for '
b'controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization. This practice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite directions. The ap\xe2\x88\x92na air goes downward, and the pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa air goes up. The pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92ma yog\xe2\x80\x9d practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into equilibrium. Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka. When both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga. By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds increase the duration of life by many, many years. A \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses. His senses, being always engaged in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged. So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity. He is at once raised to the platform of liberation. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is \nconstantly in that consciousness. Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay. The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, or food which is offered first to the Lord. Reducing the eating process is very \nhelpful in the matter of sense control. And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.

TRANSLATION
All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of sinful reaction, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such sacrifice, they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere.
PURPORTFrom the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one\xc3\x95s possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses. Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life. This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere. All the above-mentioned sacrifices help \none to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence. By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?
PURPORTWhatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation. In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one\xc3\x95s dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically \nsolves our economic problems. By performance of yaj\xc5\x81a we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.\xc3\x91even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance of yaj\xc5\x81a (sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yaj\xc5\x81a according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yaj\xc5\x81a. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A life of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material \nexistence.

PURPORTDifferent types of sacrifice, as discussed above, are mentioned in the Vedas to suit the different types of worker.

But all of them are recommended for ultimately bringing about liberation from the body. This is confirmed by \nthe Lord herewith from His own mouth.

TRANSLATION
O chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the sacrifice of material possessions. O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, after all, the sacrifice of work culminates in transcendental knowledge.
PURPORTThe purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness). Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one\xc3\x95s faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice \nmaterial possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes \ncalled karma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a, fruitive activities, and sometimes j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a, knowledge in the pursuit of truth. It is better when the end is knowledge.

TRANSLATION
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.
PURPORTThe path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam says: dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 hi s\xe2\x88\x92k\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92d-bhagavat-pra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9dtam\xc3\x91the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental \nspeculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the \nlearned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he '
b'automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.

TRANSLATION
And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings are but part of Me\xc3\x91and that they are in Me, and are Mine.
PURPORTThe result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The sense of a separated existence from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is called m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 (m\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x91not, y\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x91this). Some think that we have nothing to do with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, this impersonal Brahman is the '
b'personal effulgence of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is clearly stated that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d philosophers wrongly think that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa loses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But \nthe M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d philosophers fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world.For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Although we are separated parts of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, we are nevertheless not different from Him. The bodily difference of the living entities is m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, or not actual \nfact. We are all meant to satisfy K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. By m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The whole teaching of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be \nseparated from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and his sense of being an identity apart from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is called m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill. Having forgotten that purpose, since time \nimmemorial they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc. Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord. But when one is engaged in transcendental service through K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion. One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the supreme shelter for all living \nentities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity. Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the '
b'vyavasthiti\xc5\xa1. Liberation means to be situated in one\xc3\x95s constitutional position as the eternal servitor of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness).

Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge, you will be able to cross over the ocean of miseries.
PURPORTProper understanding of one\xc3\x95s constitutional position in relationship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which goes on in the ocean of nescience. This material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest. In the ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe. If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the greatest savior. Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation. The boat of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime.'

PURPORTPerfect knowledge of self and Superself and of their relationship is compared herein to fire. This fire not only burns up all reactions to impious activities, but also all reactions to pious activities, turning them to ashes. There are many stages of reaction: reaction in the making, reaction fructifying, reaction already achieved, and reaction a priori. But knowledge of \nthe constitutional position of the living entity burns everything to ashes. When one is in complete knowledge, all reactious, both a priori and a posteriori, are consumed. In the Vedas it is stated: ubhe uhaivai\xc5\x92a ete taraty  "One overcomes both the pious and impious interactions of work."

In this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who \nhas achieved this enjoys the self within himself in due course of time.
PURPORTWhen we speak of transcendental knowledge, we do so in terms of spiritual understanding. As such, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge. Ignorance is the cause of our bondage, and knowledge is the cause of our liberation.

A faithful man who is absorbed in transcendental knowledge and who subdues his senses quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace.
PURPORTSuch knowledge in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can be achieved by a faithful person who believes firmly in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One is called a faithful man who thinks that, simply by acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he can attain the highest perfection. This faith is attained by the discharge of devotional service, and by chanting "Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare," which cleanses one\xc3\x95s heart of all material dirt.

But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not attain God consciousness. For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in this world nor in the next.
PURPORTOut of many standard and authoritative revealed scriptures, the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is the best. Persons who are almost like animals have no faith in, or knowledge of, the standard revealed scriptures; and some, even though they have knowledge of, or can cite passages from, the revealed scriptures, have actually no faith in these words. And even though others may have faith in scriptures like Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, they do not believe in or worship the Personality \nof Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such persons cannot have any standing in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. They fall down. Out of all the abovementioned persons, those who have no faith and are always doubtful make no progress at all. Men without faith in God and His revealed word find no good in this world, nor in the next. For them there is no happiness whatsoever. One should therefore follow the principles of revealed scriptures with faith and thereby be raised to the platform of knowledge. Only this knowledge will help one become \npromoted to the transcendental platform of spiritual understanding. In other words, doubtful persons have no status whatsoever in spiritual emancipation. One should therefore follow in the footsteps of great \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas who are in the disciplic succession and thereby attain success.

TRANSLATION
Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be slashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O Bh\xe2\x88\x92rata, stand and fight.
PURPORTThe yoga system instructed in this chapter is called san\xe2\x88\x92tana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one\xc3\x95s material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one\xc3\x95s material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a \nspiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one\xc3\x95s own self (or one\xc3\x95s constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such \nunderstanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded \nto him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of \nGodhead, is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are \nbased on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor '
b'is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, but one who doubts the authority of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa falls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 have come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as it is expressed in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fourth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Transcendental Knowledge.'

Arjuna said: O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion. Now will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?
PURPORTIn this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained \ntherein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And, in the Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has perplexed Arjuna and \nconfused his determination. Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sanny\xe2\x88\x92sam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. \nHe inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.

The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better \nthan renunciation of works.
PURPORTFruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage. As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of \nbodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam confirms this as follows:na s\xe2\x88\x92dhu manye yata \xe2\x88\x92tmano \xc3\x95yam asann api kle\xe2\x80\x9cada \xe2\x88\x92sa deha\xc5\xa1par\xe2\x88\x92bhavas t\xe2\x88\x92vad abodha-j\xe2\x88\x92to y\xe2\x88\x92vanna jij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92sata \xe2\x88\x92tma-tattvamy\xe2\x88\x92vat kriy\xe2\x88\x92s t\xe2\x88\x92vad ida\xe2\x80\xb9 mano vai karm\xe2\x88\x92tmaka\xe2\x80\xb9 yena \xe2\x80\x9car\xe2\x80\x9dra-bandha\xc5\xa1eva\xe2\x80\xb9 mana\xc5\xa1 karma-va\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\xb9 prayu\xef\xac\x81kte avidyay\xe2\x88\x92tmany upadh\xe2\x80\x9dyam\xe2\x88\x92nepr\xe2\x80\x9dtir na y\xe2\x88\x92van mayi v\xe2\x88\x92sudeve na mucyate deha-yogena t\xe2\x88\x92vat"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one\xc3\x95s fruitive activities in the past. Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways. Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good. One is '
b'considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another. Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva. Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence." (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 5.5.4-6)Therefore, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation. One has to act in the status of spirit soul, \notherwise there is no escape from material bondage. Action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform. Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one\xc3\x95s advancement in real knowledge. Without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul. As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform. But action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform. Therefore, action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling. Renunciation without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is incomplete, as is Bhak ti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindbu.pr\xe2\x88\x92pa\xc5\x81cikatay\xe2\x88\x92 buddhy\xe2\x88\x92 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\xc5\xa1mumuk\xc5\x92ubhi\xc5\xa1 parity\xe2\x88\x92go vair\xe2\x88\x92gya\xe2\x80\xb9 phalgu kathyate."Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation." Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything. One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone. Then where is the question of \nrenunciation? One who knows that everything is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s property is always situated in renunciation. Since everything belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, everything should be employed in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This perfect form of action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d of the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d school.'

One who neither hates nor desires the fruits of his activities is known to be always renounced. Such a person, liberated from all dualities, easily overcomes material bondage and is completely liberated, O mighty-armed Arjuna.
PURPORTOne who is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions. Such a renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He knows fully well that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the whole and that he is part and parcel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to \nbecome full in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated\xc3\x91even in this material world.'

TRANSLATION
Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different from the analytical study of the material world [s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya]. Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths \nachieves the results of both.
PURPORTThe aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence. The soul of the material world is Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or the Supersoul. Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul. One process is to find the root of the tree, and next to water the root. The real student of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and then, in \nperfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord. Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya and karma-yoga are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.'

TRANSLATION
One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that the path of works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they are.
PURPORTThe real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. By s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process \nof s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. However, '
b'detachment from matter and attachment to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are.

Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy. The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.
PURPORTThere are two classes of sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds, or persons in the renounced order of life. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds are engaged in the study of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy, whereas the Vaisnava sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds are engaged in the study of Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds also study the but use their own commentary, called \xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9draka-bh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ya, written by \xe2\x80\xa1a\xef\xac\x81kar\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya. The students of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavata school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according to p\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81car\xe2\x88\x92trik\xe2\x80\x9d regulations, and therefore the Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds have multiple \nengagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. The Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform '
b'various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds, engaged in the studies of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya and Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam without proper understanding. Consequently their study of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam becomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds. The Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds, who are engaged \nin devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. The M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness are better situated than the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although \nthey too come to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, after many births.

TRANSLATION
One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him. Though always working, such a man is never entangled.'
b'
PURPORTOne who is on the path of liberation by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him. This is due to his K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed \nthroughout the body. Because one who works in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, there is no chance of his being deviated from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not \nlike to hear anything except topics relating to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; and he does not wish to go anywhere if K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, "Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn\'t he in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness?" Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would \ncontinue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra. Only their dresses were changed by the order of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who was personally present. Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work.

TRANSLATION
A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows \nwithin himself that he actually does nothing at all. Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from \nthem.
PURPORTA person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune. This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always \nconscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement. In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s senses. Therefore, the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses. Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses. He cannot perform any act except in the service of the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme God, is not affected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water.
PURPORTHere brahma\xe2\x80\x9ai means in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradh\xe2\x88\x92na. The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasm\xe2\x88\x92d etad brahma and, in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, mama yonir mahad \nbrahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are '
b'nondifferent from the cause. In the \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9copani\xc5\x92ad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one\xc3\x95s material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as \nthe lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: mayi sarv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai karm\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai sannyasya: "Resign all works unto Me [K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa]." The conclusion is that a person without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and should therefore be engaged in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

There are no material reactions resulting from the activities of a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person.

He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this material body, nor that he possesses the body. He knows that he is not this \nbody and that this body does not belong to him. He himself belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the body too belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.
PURPORTThe difference between a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and a person in bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, whereas the latter is attached to the results of his activities. The person who is attached to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious for fruitive rewards. In the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being due to one\xc3\x95s functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. In K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, \nthere is no duality. All that exists is a product of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is all good. Therefore, activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect. One is, therefore, filled with peace in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace. This is the secret of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness\xc3\x91realization that there is no existence besides K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the platform of peace and fearlessness.

TRANSLATION
When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither \nworking nor causing work to be done.
PURPORTThe embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates. The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature. The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires. Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and \ntherefore suffers. By K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment. Therefore, when one takes to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities. In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates. The nine gates are described as follows:nava-dv\xe2\x88\x92re pure deh\xe2\x80\x9d ha\xe2\x80\xb9so lel\xe2\x88\x92yate bahi\xc5\xa1va\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d sarvasya lokasya sth\xe2\x88\x92varasya carasya ca."The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe. The body consists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus and the genital. The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body." (\xe2\x80\xa1vet. 3.18)Therefore, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is free from both the outer and inner activities of the material body.'

TRANSLATION
The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.
PURPORTThe living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature\xc3\x91called inferior\xc3\x91of the Lord. Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as \nthe living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no '
b'control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil.

TRANSLATION
Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone\xc3\x95s sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.
PURPORTThe Sanskrit word vibhu\xc5\xa1 means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is a\xe2\x80\x9au, or \natomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living '
b'entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of \nconditioning of the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities. However, when one desires K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymn therefore declares:e\xc5\x92a u hy eva s\xe2\x88\x92dhu karma k\xe2\x88\x92rayati ta\xe2\x80\xb9 yamebhyo lokebhya unnin\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92atee\xc5\x92a u ev\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92dhu karma k\xe2\x88\x92rayati yamadho nin\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ate.aj\xc5\x81o jantur an\xe2\x80\x9dso \xc3\x95yam \xe2\x88\x92tmana\xc5\xa1 sukha-du\xc5\xa1khayo\xc5\xa1\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara-prerito gacchet svarga\xe2\x80\xb9 v\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvabhram eva ca."The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell. The \nliving entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness. By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air."Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, causes his own bewilderment. Consequently, although he is \nconstitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience. And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence. The also confirm this:vai\xc5\x92amya-nairgh\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9aye na s\xe2\x88\x92pek\xc5\x92atv\xe2\x88\x92t tath\xe2\x88\x92 hi dar\xe2\x80\x9cayati."The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."'

It is stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, "sarva\xe2\x80\xb9 j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-plavena," "j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92gni\xc5\xa1 sarva-karm\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai" and "na hi j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nena sad\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9cam." Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that \nknowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: m\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 prapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or when one attains K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the \ndaytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person '
b'who is in perfect K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is. The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious spiritual master. One can know God and one\xc3\x95s relationship with God only when one \nactually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after \nliberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.

TRANSLATION
When one\xc3\x95s intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.
PURPORTThe Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The whole Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 centers around the declaration of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the version of all Vedic literature. Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute. There is nothing more than \nthat.TheLord says, matta\xc5\xa1 paratara\xe2\x80\xb9 n\xe2\x88\x92nyat ki\xc5\x81cit asti dhana\xc5\x81jaya. Impersonal Brahman is also supported by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa: brahma\xe2\x80\x9ao prati\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1h\xe2\x88\x92ham. Therefore in all ways K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Reality. One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or, in other words, one who is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity \nand individuality) in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.

TRANSLATION
The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste] .
PURPORTA K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes. The br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the \nviewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, is present in everyone\xc3\x95s heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 regardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is present both in \nthe outcaste and in the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, although the body of a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa and that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body, whereas the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is present in each and every body. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has full \nknowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.'

TRANSLATION
Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman.
PURPORTEquanimity of mind, as mentioned above, is the sign of self-realization. Those who have actually attained to such a stage should be considered to have conquered material conditions, specifically birth and death. As long as one identifies with this body, he is considered a conditioned soul, but as soon as he is elevated to the stage of equanimity through realization of self, he is liberated from conditional life. In other words, he is no longer subject to take birth in the material world but can enter into the spiritual sky after his death. The Lord is flawless because He is without attraction or hatred. Similarly, when a \nliving entity is without attraction or hatred, he also becomes flawless and eligible to enter into the spiritual sky. Such persons are to be considered already liberated, and their symptoms are described below.'

TRANSLATION
A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon obtaining something unpleasant, who is self-intelligent, unbewildered, and who knows the science of God, is to be understood as already situated in \nTranscendence.
PURPORTThe symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein. The first symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true self. He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental port~on of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything \nwhich is related to his body. This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence. He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body \nfor the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul. This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects. This is called '
b'Brahman realization, or self-realization. Such steady consciousness is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

A person in brahma-yoga, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses his '
b'taste for material sense pleasure altogether. The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure. The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation. But a person engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids. That is the test in spiritual realization. Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.

An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.
PURPORTMaterial sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary. A liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary. Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false \npleasure? In the Padma Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa it is said:'

Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss." (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 5.5.1)Therefore, those who are true yog\xe2\x80\x9ds or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material \nexistence. The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries.

One who is able to control the forces of all these different senses, and the mind, is called gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d, or sv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d. Such gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9ds live strictly controlled lives, and forego altogether the forces of the senses. Material \ndesires, when unsatiated, generate anger, and thus the mind, eyes and chest become agitated. Therefore, one must practice to control them before one gives up this material body. One who can do this is understood to be self-realized and is thus happy in the state of self-realization. It is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger.

b'One whose happiness is within, who is active within, who rejoices within and is illumined within, is actually the perfect mystic. He is liberated in the Supreme, and ultimately he attains the Supreme.
PURPORTUnless one is able to relish happiness from within, how can one retire from the external engagements meant for deriving superficial happiness? A liberated person enjoys happiness by factual experience. He can, therefore, sit silently at any place and enjoy the activities of life from within. Such a \nliberated person no longer desires external material happiness. This state is called attaining which one is assured of going back to Godhead, back to home.

b'
PURPORTOnly a person who is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can be said to be engaged in welfare work for all living entities. When a person is actually in the knowledge that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the fountainhead of everything, then when he acts in that spirit he acts for everyone. The sufferings of humanity are due to forgetfulness of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor, and the supreme friend. Therefore, to act to revive this consciousness within the entire human society is the highest welfare work. One cannot be engaged in \nfirst-class welfare work without being liberated in the Supreme. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has no doubt about the supremacy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He has no doubt because he is completely freed from all sins. This is the state of divine love.A person engaged only in ministering to the physical welfare of human society cannot factually help anyone. Temporary relief of the external body and the mind is not satisfactory. The real cause of one\xc3\x95s difficulties in the hard struggle for life may be found in one\xc3\x95s forgetfulness of his relationship with the \nSupreme Lord. When a man is fully conscious of his relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he is actually a liberated soul, although he may be in the material tabernacle.

TRANSLATION
Those who are free from anger and all material desires, who are selfrealized, self-disciplined and constantly endeavoring for perfection, are assured of liberation in the Supreme in the very near future.
PURPORTOf the saintly persons who are constantly engaged in striving toward salvation, one who is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the best of all. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam confirms this fact as follows:yat-p\xe2\x88\x92da-pa\xef\xac\x81kaja-pal\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ca-vil\xe2\x88\x92sa-bhakty\xe2\x88\x92karm\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9caya\xe2\x80\xb9 grathitam udgrathayanti santa\xc5\xa1tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo \xc3\x95pi ruddha-srotoga\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92s tam ara\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 bhaja v\xe2\x88\x92sudevam."Just try to worship, in devotional service, V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive activities." (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 4.22.39)In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such \ndesires, despite great endeavors. A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme. Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance. To cite an analagous example of this:sv\xe2\x88\x92nya paty\xe2\x88\x92ni pu\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aanti tath\xe2\x88\x92ham api padmaja."By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring. Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them. The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation. The eggs of the tortoise are laid \non land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water. Similarly, a '
b'devotee in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, although far away from the Lord\xc3\x95s abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly\xc3\x91by engagement in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.

TRANSLATION
Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within '
b'the nostrils\xc3\x91thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the tranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger. One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.
PURPORTBeing engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can immediately understand one\xc3\x95s spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service. When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the \nLord in the sphere of one\xc3\x95s activity. This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, \xe2\x88\x92sana, pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92ma, praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra, dh\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na, and sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is \nexplicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained. One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids. There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep. Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of \nbeing attracted by sense objects. The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body. By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation. In other words, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles. This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement. This is a better way of controlling the senses than by the a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga.'

TRANSLATION
The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.
PURPORTThe conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92. In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvar\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 \nparama\xe2\x80\xb9 mahe\xe2\x80\x9cvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world '
b'either individually or collectively. This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga. The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator. Such \nwork is not different from transcendental knowledge. Direct K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one\xc3\x95s relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, and that is \nthe cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world. The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one\xc3\x95s practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer \nthe influence of desire and anger. And, attaining K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, \xe2\x88\x92sana, praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na, dh\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92, pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92ma, and sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. But these only \npreface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the \nhuman being. It is the highest perfection of life.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Fifth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Karma-yoga, or Action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Consciousness.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work.
PURPORTIn this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses. However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali. Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their \nparaphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the \nliving entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, the perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d.The sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yaj\xc5\x81as (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is \nbecoming one with the impersonal Brahman. Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest. Similarly, the mystic yog\xe2\x80\x9d who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self. But a person acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction. His criterion of success is the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus he is the perfect sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, or perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d. Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:'
b'na dhana\xe2\x80\xb9 na jana\xe2\x80\xb9 na sundar\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xb9 kavit\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 v\xe2\x88\x92 jagad\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9ca k\xe2\x88\x92maye.mama janmani janman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvare bhavat\xe2\x88\x92d bhaktir ahaituk\xe2\x80\x9d tvayi."O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women. Nor do I want any number of followers. What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth."

TRANSLATION
What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, for no one can become a yog\xe2\x80\x9d unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.
PURPORTReal sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense '
b'gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is simultaneously a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d and a yog\xe2\x80\x9d. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in \nthe j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na and yoga processes, is automatically served in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na and yoga are of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

PURPORTThe process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization. This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life. According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names. But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts, namely j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga and bhakti-yoga. The beginning of the ladder \nis called the yog\xe2\x88\x92ruruk\xc5\x92a stage, and the highest rung is called Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities. All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses. When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.\nA K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. And, being constantly engaged in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he is considered to have ceased all material activities.

TRANSLATION
A person is said to have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities.
PURPORTWhen a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities. Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement. Without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities. But a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification. One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.

A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.'

PURPORTThe word \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 denotes body, mind and soul\xc3\x91depending upon different circumstances. In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important. Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 refers here to the mind. The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind \nand to draw it away from attachment to sense objects. It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience. In material existence one is subjected to the influence of \nthe mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind\xc3\x95s ego which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence. The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this. It is also said:mana eva manu\xc5\x92y\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 bandha-mok\xc5\x92ayo\xc5\xa1bandh\xe2\x88\x92ya vi\xc5\x92ay\xe2\x88\x92sa\xef\xac\x81go muktyai nirvi\xc5\x92aya\xe2\x80\xb9 mana\xc5\xa1."For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation. Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation." Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.

TRANSLATION
For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy.
PURPORTThe purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission. Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time. One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one\xc3\x95s mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide \nby the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. Real yoga practice entails meeting the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 within the heart and then following His dictation. For one who takes to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.

TRANSLATION
For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, \nhonor and dishonor are all the same.
PURPORTActually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one\xc3\x95s mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having \nalready reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one\xc3\x95s mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of \nmaterial existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practical sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi, or absorption in the Supreme.

PURPORTBook knowledge without realization of the Supreme Truth is useless. This is stated as follows:ata\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9cr\xe2\x80\x9d-k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-n\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92di na bhaved gr\xe2\x88\x92hyam indriyai\xc5\xa1sevonmukhe hi jihv\xe2\x88\x92dau svayam eva sphuraty ada\xc5\xa1."No one can understand the transcendental nature of the name, form, quality and pastimes of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa through his materially contaminated senses. Only when one becomes spiritually saturated by transcendental service to the \nLord are the transcendental name, form, quality and pastimes of the Lord revealed to him." (Padma Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa)This Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. No one can become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious simply by mundane scholarship. One must be fortunate enough to associate with a person who is in pure consciousness. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person has realized knowledge, by the grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, because he is satisfied with pure devotional service. By realized knowledge, one \nbecomes perfect. By transcendental knowledge one can remain steady in his convictions, but by mere academic knowledge one can be easily deluded and '
b'confused by apparent contradictions. It is the realized soul who is actually self-controlled because he is surrendered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is transcendental because he has nothing to do with mundane scholarship. For him mundane scholarship and mental speculation, which may be as good as gold to others, are of no greater value than pebbles or stones.

TRANSLATION
A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are \nalso partially K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. A directly K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman or Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yog\xe2\x80\x9d are imperfectly K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious.\nNevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later. The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One should always think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and not forget Him even for a moment. Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi or trance. In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in \nseclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects. He should be very careful '
b'to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization. And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness because direct K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness. an\xe2\x88\x92saktasya vi\xc5\x92ay\xe2\x88\x92n yath\xe2\x88\x92rham upayu\xc5\x81jata\xc5\xa1nirbandha\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-sambandhe yukta\xe2\x80\xb9 vair\xe2\x88\x92gyam ucyatepr\xe2\x88\x92pa\xc5\x81cikatay\xe2\x88\x92 buddhy\xe2\x88\x92 hari-sambandhi-vastuna\xc5\xa1mumuk\xc5\x92ubhi\xc5\xa1 parity\xe2\x88\x92go vair\xe2\x88\x92gya\xe2\x80\xb9 phalgu kathyate.(Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu 2.255\xc3\x90256)"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one is rightly situated above possessiveness. On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not as complete in his renunciation."A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person well knows that everything belongs to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession. As such, he has no \nhankering for anything on his own personal account. He knows how to accept things in favor of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Therefore a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d.

TRANSLATION
To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay ku\xe2\x80\x9ca-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place. The \nyog\xe2\x80\x9d should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.
PURPORT"Sacred place" refers to places of pilgrimage. In India the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Pray\xe2\x88\x92g, Mathur\xe2\x88\x92, V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, and Hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamun\xe2\x88\x92 and the Ganges flow. But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they \nare not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga. One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the B\xe2\x80\x9ehan-N\xe2\x88\x92rad\xe2\x80\x9dya Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the '
b'present yuga or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.harer n\xe2\x88\x92ma harer n\xe2\x88\x92ma harer n\xe2\x88\x92maiva kevalamkalau n\xe2\x88\x92sty eva n\xe2\x88\x92sty eva n\xe2\x88\x92sty eva gatir anyath\xe2\x88\x92."In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
One should hold one\xc3\x95s body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the \nheart and make Me the ultimate goal of life.
PURPORTThe goal of life is to know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is situated within the heart of every living being as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, the four-handed Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form. The yoga process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized form of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and not for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa dwelling within one\xc3\x95s heart. One who has no program to realize this Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-murti is uselessly engaged in mock-yoga practice and is certainly wasting his time. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 is the ultimate goal of life, and the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-murti situated in one\xc3\x95s heart is the object of yoga practice. To realize this Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as \nmentioned above. One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yog\xe2\x80\x9d. One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief. In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Y\xe2\x88\x92j\xc5\x81avalkya it is said:karma\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 manas\xe2\x88\x92 v\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92 sarv\xe2\x88\x92vasth\xe2\x88\x92su sarvad\xe2\x88\x92sarvatra maithu\xe2\x80\x9aa-ty\xe2\x88\x92go brahmacarya\xe2\x80\xb9 pracak\xc5\x92ate."The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind\xc3\x91at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places." No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence. Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life. Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9ds. Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhy\xe2\x88\x92na, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na or bhakti. One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having '
b'sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d. Such a restrained householder brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na and dhy\xe2\x88\x92na schools do not admit even householder brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9ds. They require complete abstinence without compromise. In the bhakti school, a householder brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is said:vi\xc5\x92ay\xe2\x88\x92 vinivartante nir\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92rasya dehina\xc5\xa1rasa-varja\xe2\x80\xb9 raso \xc3\x95py asya para\xe2\x80\xb9 d\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1v\xe2\x88\x92 nivartateWhereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste. Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.Vigatabh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1. One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his \nforgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam says, bhaya\xe2\x80\xb9 dvit\xe2\x80\x9dy\xe2\x88\x92bhinive\xe2\x80\x9cata\xc5\xa1 sy\xe2\x88\x92d \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92d apetasya viparyayo \xc3\x94sm\xe2\x80\x9eti\xc5\xa1: K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness. Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is already the best of all yog\xe2\x80\x9ds.

TRANSLATION
Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa] by \ncessation of material existence.
PURPORTThe ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained. Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence. One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yog\xe2\x80\x9d according to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Nor does cessation of material existence entail one\xc3\x95s entering into "the void," which is only a myth. There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord. Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the \nspiritual sky, the abode of the Lord. The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as that place where there is no need of sun, moon, nor electricity. All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky. The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called para\xe2\x80\xb9 dh\xe2\x88\x92ma, or superior abodes.\nA consummate yog\xe2\x80\x9d, who is perfect in understanding Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as is clearly \nstated herein (mat-citta\xc5\xa1, mat-para\xc5\xa1, mat-sth\xe2\x88\x92nam) by the Lord Himself, can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-loka known as Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is clearly stated that the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies. No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha Goloka \nV\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana) of the Lord without the proper understanding of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and His plenary expansion Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Therefore a person working in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d, because his mind is always absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s activities. Sa '
b'vai mana\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-pad\xe2\x88\x92ravindayo\xc5\xa1. In the Vedas also we learn: tam eva viditv\xe2\x88\x92tim\xe2\x80\x9etyum eti: "One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa." In other words, perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.

TRANSLATION
There is no possibility of one\xc3\x95s becoming a yog\xe2\x80\x9d, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.
PURPORTRegulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds. Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together. There is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa will '
b'suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things. Bhu\xc5\x81jate te tv agha\xe2\x80\xb9 papa ye pacanty \xe2\x88\x92tma-k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92t. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga. It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. A person in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, only the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga. The K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he \nmust consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of \nignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal. Such a person cannot perform yoga.

PURPORTExtravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating\xc3\x91which are demands of the body\xc3\x91can block advancement in the practice of yoga. As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, sanctified food. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is offered, according to the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 (Bg. 9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not \nin the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a engaged in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and who could not sleep more than two hours \na day, and sometimes not even that. \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kura Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa would not even accept pras\xe2\x88\x92dam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. \nAnd because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.

b'mission of the Lord. All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Ambar\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92a. Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical. In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed \nactivities are called arcan\xe2\x88\x92, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord. The senses and the mind require engagements. Simple abnegation is not practical. Therefore, for people in general\xc3\x91especially those who are not in the renounced order of life\xc3\x91transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.

TRANSLATION
The stage of perfection is called trance, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi, when one\xc3\x95s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This is \ncharacterized by one\xc3\x95s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses. \nEstablished thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he \nthinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.
PURPORTBy practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi which means that the yog\xe2\x80\x9d realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Pata\xc5\x81jali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real \npurpose of the Pata\xc5\x81jali system of yoga. There is an acceptance of '
b'transcendental pleasure in the Pata\xc5\x81jali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure\xc3\x91realized through transcendental senses\xc3\x91is accepted. And this is corroborated by the Pata\xc5\x81jali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declares in his citi-\xe2\x80\x9caktir iti.\nThis citi-\xe2\x80\x9cakti, or internal potency, is transcendental. Puru\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92rtha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the Supreme" is called kaivalyam by the monist. But according to Pata\xc5\x81jali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpa\xe2\x80\x9aa-m\xe2\x88\x92rjanam, or clearance of the impure \nmirror of the mind. This "clearance" is actually liberation, or bhava-mah\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92gni-nirv\xe2\x88\x92pa\xe2\x80\x9aam. The theory of nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa!also \npreliminary!corresponds with this principle. In the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam this is called The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 also confirms this situation in this verse.After nirv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In \nthe words of the this is the "real life of the living entity." M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Pata\xc5\x81jali also accepts this by his words This citi-\xe2\x80\x9cakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta-as \xe2\x88\x92nandamayo \xc3\x95bhy\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92t. This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi, called sampraj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92ta-sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi and asampraj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92ta-sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. When one becomes \nsituated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called sampraj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92ta-sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. In the asampraj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92ta-sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi there is no longer '
b'any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the yog\xe2\x80\x9d is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the yog\xe2\x80\x9d is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today\xc3\x95s so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A yog\xe2\x80\x9d indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those yog\xe2\x80\x9ds who are attracted by the \nsiddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated. If the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the \nstage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.The best practice of yoga in this age is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, which is not baffling. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, \nbut there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga or in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences!such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative!but he is always alert to execute his duties in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or bhakti-yoga. Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x88\x92gam\xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x88\x92yino \xc3\x95nity\xe2\x88\x92s t\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9s titik\xc5\x92asva bh\xe2\x88\x92rata. He endures all such incidental \noccurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.

TRANSLATION
One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.
PURPORTThe yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the practice without deviation. One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success. Success is sure for the rigid practitioner. Regarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d says:uts\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92n ni\xe2\x80\x9ccay\xe2\x88\x92d dhairy\xe2\x88\x92t tat tat karma-pravartan\xe2\x88\x92tsa\xef\xac\x81ga-ty\xe2\x88\x92g\xe2\x88\x92t satov\xe2\x80\x9ette\xc5\xa1 \xc5\x92a\xc5\xb8bhir bhakti\xc5\xa1 prasidhyati"The process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness."As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean. A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves. The sparrow '
b'became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs. The ocean did not even consider her appeal. So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean. She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination. The news of her activity spread, and at last Garu\xc5\xb8a, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, heard it. He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow. Garu\xc5\xb8a was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help. Thus Garu\xc5\xb8a at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest \nhe himself take up the work of the sparrow. The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs. Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garu\xc5\xb8a.Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job. But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves.

TRANSLATION
Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self \nalone and should think of nothing else.'
b'
PURPORTBy proper conviction and intelligence one should gradually cease sense activities. This is called praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra. The mind, being controlled by conviction, meditation, and cessation of the senses, should be situated in trance, or sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi. At that time there is no longer any danger of becoming engaged in the material conception of life. In other words, although one is involved with matter as long as the material body exists, one should not think about sense gratification. One should think of no pleasure aside from the pleasure of the \nSupreme Self. This state is easily attained by directly practicing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.
PURPORTThe nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady. But a self-realized yog\xe2\x80\x9d has to control the mind; the mind should not control him. One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d, or sv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d, and one '
b'who is controlled by the mind is called god\xe2\x88\x92sa, or the servant of the senses. A gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d knows the standard of sense happiness. In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca or the supreme owner of the senses\xc3\x91K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Serving K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa with purified senses is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That is the way of bringing the senses under full control. What is more, that is the highest perfection of yoga practice.

PURPORTSelf-realization means knowing one\xc3\x95s constitutional position in relationship to the Supreme. The individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme, and his position is to render transcendental service to the Lord. This transcendental contact with the Supreme is called brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9spar\xe2\x80\x9ca.

TRANSLATION
A true yog\xe2\x80\x9d observes Me in all beings, and also sees every being in Me. Indeed, the self-realized man sees Me everywhere.
PURPORTA K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious yog\xe2\x80\x9d is the perfect seer because he sees K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme, situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as Supersoul (Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92). \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 The Lord in His Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa. The perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially \naffected by His presence in either a dog or a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord. The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts. That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul. One who is not factually in the practice of \nyoga cannot see so clearly. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person can see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever. In the sm\xe2\x80\x9eti this is confirmed as follows: \xe2\x88\x92tatatv\xe2\x88\x92c ca m\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x80\x9etv\xe2\x88\x92d \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 hi paramo hari\xc5\xa1.The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer. As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father (or Mother) is also. Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being. Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord. As \nwill be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies!the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior). The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord\xc3\x95s energy. Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d sees equally because he sees '
b'that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God. While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly. In either case the living entity is the servant of God. This vision of equality is perfect in a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.
PURPORTA person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness certainly sees Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa everywhere, and he sees everything in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, knowing that everything is the manifestation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy. Nothing can exist without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Lord of everything\xc3\x91this is the basic principle of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the development of love of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa!a position transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond self-'
b'realization at which the devotee becomes one with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in the sense that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92:prem\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81jana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanenasanta\xc5\xa1 sadaiva h\xe2\x80\x9edaye\xc5\x92u vilokayantigovindam \xe2\x88\x92di-puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 tam aha\xe2\x80\xb9 bhaj\xe2\x88\x92mi\xc3\x92I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara situated within the heart of the devotee." (Bs. 5.38)At this stage, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yog\xe2\x80\x9d who sees the Lord as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 within the heart, the same applies. Such a yog\xe2\x80\x9d turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the \nLord within himself.

The yog\xe2\x80\x9d who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one worships Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances.
PURPORTA yog\xe2\x80\x9d who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the plenary portion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au\xc3\x91with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d should know that Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is not different from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart. Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities. Nor is there a difference between a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and a perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d engaged in meditation on the Supersoul. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness\xc3\x91even though he may be engaged in various \nactivities while in material existence\xc3\x91remains always situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

He is a perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!
PURPORTOne who is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is a perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d; he is aware of everyone\xc3\x95s happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience. The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God. And the cause of happiness is knowing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be the supreme enjoyer of all the \nactivities of the human being. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the proprietor of all lands and planets. The perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d is the sincerest friend of all living entities. He knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Because one in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa everywhere. Since the perfect yog\xe2\x80\x9d tries to broadcast the importance of becoming K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the '
b'world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord. Na tasm\xe2\x88\x92t ka\xe2\x80\x9ccid me priyak\xe2\x80\x9et tama\xc5\xa1. In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone. He is the best yog\xe2\x80\x9d because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also. He does not envy his fellow living entities. Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yog\xe2\x80\x9d interested only in his personal elevation. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d who has withdrawn to a secluded place in order to meditate perfectly may not be as perfect as a devotee who is trying his best to \nturn every man toward K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.
PURPORTThe system of mysticism described by Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to Arjuna beginning with the words \xe2\x80\x9cucau de\xe2\x80\x9ce and ending with yog\xe2\x80\x9d parama\xc5\xa1 is here being rejected by '
b'Arjuna out of a feeling of inability. It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this age of Kali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and \ndetachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age \nof Kali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are \ncertainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal.

For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.
PURPORTThe mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the intelligence, although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence. For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it is certainly very difficult to control the mind. Artificially, one may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind. In the Vedic literatures it is said:\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92na\xe2\x80\xb9 rathina\xe2\x80\xb9 viddhi \xe2\x80\x9car\xe2\x80\x9dra\xe2\x80\xb9 ratham eva cabuddhintu s\xe2\x88\x92rathi\xe2\x80\xb9 viddhi mana\xc5\xa1 pragraham eva caindriy\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai hay\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92hur vi\xc5\x92ay\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9s te\xc5\x92u gocar\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92tmendriya-mano-yukto bhoktety \xe2\x88\x92hur man\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92i\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1."The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is the driver. Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are the horses. The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses. So it is understood by great thinkers." Intelligence is \nsupposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it often overcomes even one\xc3\x95s own intelligence. Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna. And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind. And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind. The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting "Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa," the great \nmantra for deliverance, in all humility. The method prescribed is sa vai mana\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-pad\xe2\x88\x92ravindayo\xc5\xa1: one must engage one\xc3\x95s mind fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Only then \nwill there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by \ndetachment.
PURPORTThe difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present \nage no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the more one becomes \nenlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vair\xe2\x88\x92gya. Vair\xe2\x88\x92gya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This is practical because by hearing about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service, one feels \ntranscendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success. That is My opinion.'
b'
PURPORTThe Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while \npouring water on it. Similarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned. Therefore, the mind must be \ncontrolled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve \nsuccess without becoming K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who '
b'later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?
PURPORTThe path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with \nGod, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly \nassured, Arjuna is asking Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons. First of all, one may not be following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory \nenergy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yog\xe2\x88\x92t calita-m\xe2\x88\x92nasa\xc5\xa1: deviation from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.'

TRANSLATION
O mighty-armed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, does not such a man, being deviated from the path of Transcendence, perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere?
PURPORTThere are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in Transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material \nhappiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. The brahma\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the \nSupreme Lord who is manifested as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful '
b'transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 realization takes many, many births: Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the direct method.

This is my doubt O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the perfect knower of past, present and future. In the beginning of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the Lord said that all living entities exist individually in the past, that they exist now in the present, and that they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material \nentanglement. So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or above K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him. Therefore the verdict of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the final and complete answer to all doubts because He knows past, present and future '
b'perfectly\xc3\x91but no one knows Him. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious devotees alone can know what is what.

The Blessed Lord said: Son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual \nworld; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.
PURPORTIn the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (1.5.17) \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d N\xe2\x88\x92rada Muni instructs Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva as follows:tyaktv\xe2\x88\x92 sva-dharma\xe2\x80\xb9 cara\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92mbuja\xe2\x80\xb9 harerbhajann apakko \xc3\x95tha patet tato yadiko v\xe2\x88\x92rtha \xe2\x88\x92pto \xc3\x95bhajat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sva-dharmata\xc5\xa1'
b'"If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way. On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything." For material prospects, there are many activities both scriptural and customary. A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One may argue that by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries. Even though he may be \nsubjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life. On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated. Those who are \nengaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section. And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section. The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities. Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually \nremain in material existence, which is always miserable. On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness certainly progress in life.Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the ultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Those who are following the rules and regulations of the '
b'scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification. Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life!even to the higher planets; but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path. The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation. Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious. Activity in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity. And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.

PURPORTThe unsuccessful yog\xe2\x80\x9ds are divided into two classes: one is fallen after very little progress, and one is fallen after long practice of yoga. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d who falls after a short period of practice goes to the higher planets where pious living entities are allowed to enter. After prolonged life there, he is sent back again to this planet, to take birth in the family of a righteous br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava or of aristocratic merchants.\nThe real purpose of yoga practice is to achieve the highest perfection of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness. But those who do not persevere to such an extent and fail due to material allurements are allowed, by the grace of the Lord, to make full utilization of their material propensities. And after that, they are given opportunities to live prosperous lives in righteous or aristocratic families. Those who are born in such families may take advantage of the facilities and try to elevate themselves to full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

PURPORTBirth in a family of yog\xe2\x80\x9ds or transcendentalists\xc3\x91those with great wisdom\xc3\x91is praised herein because the child born in such a family receives spiritual impetus from the very beginning of his life. It is especially the case in the \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya or gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d families. Such families are very learned and devoted by tradition and training, and thus they become spiritual masters. In India there are many such \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya families, but they have now degenerated due to insufficient education and training. By the grace of the Lord, there are still \nfamilies that foster transcendentalists generation after generation. It is certainly very fortunate to take birth in such families.

PURPORTKing Bharata, who took his third birth in the family of a good br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, is an example of good birth for the revival of previous transcendental consciousness. King Bharata was the Emperor of the world, and since his time this planet is known among the demigods as Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratavar\xc5\x92a. Formerly it was known as Il\xe2\x88\x92vartavar\xc5\x92a. The Emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a good br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa and was known as Ja\xc5\xb8abharata because he always \nremained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on, he was discovered understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice of yoga, never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated \nopportunities for complete perfection in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

PURPORTAdvanced yog\xe2\x80\x9ds are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can elevate them to complete K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the highest yoga perfection. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (3.33.8), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the \nadvanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:aho bata \xe2\x80\x9cvapaco \xc3\x95to gar\xe2\x80\x9dy\xe2\x88\x92nyajjihv\xe2\x88\x92gre vartate n\xe2\x88\x92ma tubhyamtepus tapas te juhuvu\xc5\xa1 sasnur \xe2\x88\x92ry\xe2\x88\x92"O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters. Such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, bathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies."The famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa as one of His most important disciples. Although \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur \nHarid\xe2\x88\x92sa happened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was elevated to the post of n\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it \nis understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the Vedas, known as \xe2\x80\x9cabda-brahman. Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the principle of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
A yog\xe2\x80\x9d is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yog\xe2\x80\x9d.
PURPORTWhen we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted. When the linking up \nprocess is predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, when it is predominantly empirical, it is called j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and when it is \npredominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas, as will be explained in the next verse. The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better than bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can excel it. \nAsceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhakti-yoga, and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
And of all yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.
PURPORTThe word bhajete is significant here. Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service. The English word "worship" cannot be used in the same sense as bhaja. Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one. But service with love and faith is \nespecially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned. Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution. Failing to do this, he falls down. The Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam confirms this as follows:ya e\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 s\xe2\x88\x92k\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92d \xe2\x88\x92tma-prabhavam \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvaramna bhajanty avaj\xe2\x88\x92nanti sth\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92d bhra\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92 patanty adha\xc5\xa1."Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position."'
b'In this verse also the word bhajanti is used. Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity. The word avaj\xe2\x88\x92nanti, used in this verse of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: avaj\xe2\x88\x92nanti \n"Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa." Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 without an attitude of service to the Lord. Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word "worship."The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga. All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga. Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga. From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization. Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path. When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and \nrenunciation, the stage is called j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga. When j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga. And, when one surpasses the a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination. Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas. The yog\xe2\x80\x9d who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good \nfortune. One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yog\xe2\x80\x9d, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yog\xe2\x80\x9d or dhy\xe2\x88\x92na-yog\xe2\x80\x9d, r\xe2\x88\x92ja-yog\xe2\x80\x9d, ha\xc4\xb1ha-yog\xe2\x80\x9d, etc. If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas. Therefore, to become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world\xc3\x95s highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.\nIt is by great fortune that one comes to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction. The ideal yog\xe2\x80\x9d concentrates his attention on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is called \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded. Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti. He incarnates in different forms such as R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9ha, Var\xe2\x88\x92ha '
b'and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of Mother Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92, and He is known as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Govinda and V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva. He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities. If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yog\xe2\x80\x9d.This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as \nis confirmed in all Vedic literature:yasya deve par\xe2\x88\x92 bhaktir yath\xe2\x88\x92 deve tath\xe2\x88\x92 gurau.tasyaite kathit\xe2\x88\x92 hy arth\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cante mah\xe2\x88\x92tmana\xc5\xa1."Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed."Bhaktir asya bhajana\xe2\x80\xb9 tadih\xe2\x88\x92mutrop\xe2\x88\x92dhi nair\xe2\x88\x92syen\xe2\x88\x92mu\xc5\x92min mana\xc5\xa1 kalpanam; etad eva nai\xc5\x92karmyam. \xc3\x92Bhakti means devotional service to the Lord \nwhich is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next. Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme. That is the purpose of nai\xc5\x92karmya.\xc3\x93These are some of the means for performance of bhakti or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of S\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya-yoga Brahma-vidy\xe2\x88\x92.'

TRANSLATION
Now hear, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92 [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.
PURPORTIn this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the nature of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is fully described. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein. Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are described in this chapter.In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the living entity has been described \nas nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas. At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or in other words K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga. By concentrating one\xc3\x95s mind upon K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one is able to know the Absolute Truth \ncompletely, but not otherwise. Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is partial. \nFull and scientific knowledge is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and everything is revealed to the person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In complete K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness one knows that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts. Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One who takes \ndirectly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 in full. By practice of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full!namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the \nmaterial nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter. Concentration of the mind upon K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which \xe2\x80\x9crava\xe2\x80\x9aam is the first and most important. The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, "tat \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9au," or "Hear from Me." No one can be a greater authority than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for \nprogress in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One has therefore to learn from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'directly or from a pure devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa!and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam this process of understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9avat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sva-kath\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 pu\xe2\x80\x9aya-\xe2\x80\x9crava\xe2\x80\x9aa-k\xe2\x80\x9drtana\xc5\xa1h\xe2\x80\x9edyanta\xc5\xa1stho hy abhadr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai vidbunoti suh\xe2\x80\x9et sat\xe2\x88\x92m.na\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a-pr\xe2\x88\x92ye\xc5\x92v abhadre\xc5\x92u nitya\xe2\x80\xb9 bh\xe2\x88\x92gavata-sevay\xe2\x88\x92bhagavaty uttama-\xe2\x80\x9cloke bhaktir bhavati nai\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hik\xe2\x80\x9d.tad\xe2\x88\x92 rajas-tamo-bh\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x88\x92ma-lobhadaya\xe2\x80\x9c ca yeceta etair an\xe2\x88\x92viddha\xe2\x80\xb9 sthita\xe2\x80\xb9 sattve pras\xe2\x80\x9ddati.evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogata\xc5\xa1bhagavat-tattva-vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na\xe2\x80\xb9 mukta-sa\xef\xac\x81gasya j\xe2\x88\x92yate.bhidyate h\xe2\x80\x9edaya-granthi\xe2\x80\x9c chidyante sarva-sa\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9cay\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1k\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dyante c\xe2\x88\x92sya karm\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai d\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a ev\xe2\x88\x92tman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvare."To hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears \nabout K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is dwelling in everyone\xc3\x95s heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of \nHim. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. As he hears more about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished. When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and \nunderstands the science of God perfectly. Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of \xc3\x94asa\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9caya\xe2\x80\xb9 samagram,\xc3\x95 understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.2.17\xc3\x9021)Therefore only by hearing from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or from His devotee in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness can one understand the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'

TRANSLATION
I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge both phenomenal and noumenal, by knowing which there shall remain nothing further to be known.
PURPORTComplete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the spirit behind it. The source of both of them is transcendental knowledge. The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s confidential devotee and friend. In the beginning of the \nFourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession. Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practices. When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable \nbecomes known, and nothing remains unknown. The Vedas say, \xc3\x92yasmin \nvij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92te sarvam eva vij\xc5\x81atam bhavanti.\xc3\x93'

Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.
PURPORTThere are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The \nfirst six chapters of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, dhy\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and discrimination of the self from matter. However, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can only be known by persons who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman \nand Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. The yog\xe2\x80\x9ds and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x80\x9ds are confused in their attempts to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, although the greatest of the impersonalists, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dp\xe2\x88\x92da \xe2\x80\xa1a\xef\xac\x81kar\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, has admitted in his G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 commentary that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme '
b'Personality of Godhead. But his followers do not accept K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as such, for it is very difficult to know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha\xc5\xa1 an\xe2\x88\x92dir \xe2\x88\x92dir govinda\xc5\xa1 sarva-k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aa-k\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aam. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of \nbhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and \nregulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu:\xe2\x80\x9cruti-sm\xe2\x80\x9eti-pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92di-pa\xc5\x81car\xe2\x88\x92tra-vidhi\xe2\x80\xb9 vin\xe2\x88\x92aik\xe2\x88\x92ntik\xe2\x80\x9d harer bhaktir utp\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x88\x92yaiva kalpate."Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upani\xc5\x92ads, Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas, N\xe2\x88\x92rada-pa\xc5\x81car\xe2\x88\x92tra, etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 realized yog\xe2\x80\x9d to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the \nson of mother Ya\xe2\x80\x9cod\xe2\x88\x92 or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa: \xc3\x92,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92m\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 tu veda na ka\xe2\x80\x9ccana.\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92No one knows Me as I am,\xc3\x93 the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then \xc3\x92sa mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 sudurlabha\xc5\xa1.\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92Such a great soul is very rare.\xc3\x93 Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as He is (tattvata\xc5\xa1), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher.

Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego\xc3\x91altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies.
PURPORTThe science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies. Material nature is called prak\xe2\x80\x9eti, or the energy of the Lord in His different puru\xc5\x92a incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata Tantra:ekantu mahata\xc5\xa1 sra\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x80\x9e dvit\xe2\x80\x9dya\xe2\x80\xb9 tv a\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a-sa\xe2\x80\xb9sthitam'
b'"For material creation, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s plenary expansion assumes three Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aus. The first one, Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them. The third, K\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9drodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, who is present even within the atoms. Anyone who knows these three Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aus can be liberated from material entanglement."This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord. All the activities of the material world are directed by these three \nVi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au expansions of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. These Puru\xc5\x92as are called incarnations. Generally one who does not know the science of God (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the causes (Puru\xc5\x92as), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy. According to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 this atheistic conclusion is false. In the verse under discussion it is stated that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original cause of the \nmaterial manifestation. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam also confirms this. The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord. Even the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky. There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1halokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal. The Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the \nK\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9drodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. The Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world. Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned. Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, \nwithin which the five sense objects are included. They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell. Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more. But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists. Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The false ego!"I am," and "It is mine," which constitute the basic principle of material existence!includes ten sense '
b'organs for material activities. Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva. Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the cause of all causes. The subject matter for discussion in the s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as it is described in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.

TRANSLATION
Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.
PURPORTHere it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord. The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, '
b'intelligence and false ego. Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy. The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions. The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity. Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always controlled by the Lord\xc3\x91they have no independant existence. They are never equally \npowerful, as unintelligent men think. The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam as follows (10.87.30):aparimit\xe2\x88\x92 dhruv\xe2\x88\x92s tanubh\xe2\x80\x9eto yadi sarva-gat\xe2\x88\x92starhi\xe2\x80\xb9 na \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92syateti niyamo dhruva netarath\xe2\x88\x92ajani ca yanmaya\xe2\x80\xb9 tad avimucya niyant\xe2\x80\x9ebhavet samam anuj\xe2\x88\x92nat\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 yad-amata\xe2\x80\xb9 mata-du\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1atay\xe2\x88\x92"O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control. But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control. Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy. In that constitutional position only can they be controllers. Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory \nthat God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading themselves and others."The Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him. These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power. While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets \nhis real spiritual mind and intelligence. This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity. But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation. The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, "I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine." His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God. Therefore one may '
b'conclude that the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, or liberated.

TRANSLATION
Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both its origin and dissolution.
PURPORTEverything that exists is a product of matter and spirit. Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit. Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is \ndeveloped because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the '
b'Lord, namely, the living entity, may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe. The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the supreme creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad confirms: nityo nity\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 cetana\xe2\x80\x9c cetan\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m.

TRANSLATION
O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.
PURPORTThere is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal. As far as Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and this is confirmed in every step. In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person. That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92: \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha\xc5\xa1; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, '
b'and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the an\xe2\x88\x92maya\xe2\x80\xb9 ya etad vidur am\xe2\x80\x9et\xe2\x88\x92s te bhavanti athetare du\xc5\xa1kham ev\xe2\x88\x92pi yanti. "In the material world Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the primeval living entity within the universe, is \nunderstood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals. But beyond Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 there is the Transcendence who has no material \nform and is free from all material contaminations. Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world."The impersonalist puts more stress on the word But this  is not impersonal. It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 quoted above. Other verses in the \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad substantiate this as follows:ved\xe2\x88\x92ham eta\xe2\x80\xb9 puru\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\xb9 mah\xe2\x88\x92ntam \xe2\x88\x92ditya-var\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 tamasa\xc5\xa1 parast\xe2\x88\x92ttam eva vidv\xe2\x88\x92n am\xe2\x80\x9eta iha bhavati n\xe2\x88\x92nya\xc5\xa1 panth\xe2\x88\x92 vidyate ayan\xe2\x88\x92yayasm\xe2\x88\x92t para\xe2\x80\xb9 n\xe2\x88\x92param asti ki\xc5\x81cid yasm\xe2\x88\x92nn\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9dyo na jy\xe2\x88\x92yo \xc3\x95sti ki\xc5\x81cit"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness. Only he who knows Him can transcend the \nbonds of birth and death. There is no way for liberation other than this \nknowledge of that Supreme Person."There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost. He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest. He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies."From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual.

TRANSLATION
O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability \nin man.
PURPORTThis verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by \nHis all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man\xc3\x95s thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict \nbetween personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda-tattvam\xc3\x91simultaneously one and different.The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly pra\xe2\x80\x9aava '
b'or the omk\xe2\x88\x92ra transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omk\xe2\x88\x92ra. But they do not realize that omk\xe2\x88\x92ra is the sound representation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The jurisdiction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are in illusion, and so knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is liberation, and ignorance of Him is \nbondage.

PURPORTPu\xe2\x80\x9aya means that which is not decomposed; pu\xe2\x80\x9aya is original. Everything in the material world has a certain flavor or fragrance, as the flavor and fragrance in a flower, or in the earth, in water, in fire, in air, etc. The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can '
b'be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste. Vibh\xe2\x88\x92va means fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The heat in the fire is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. In K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The duration of man\xc3\x95s life is also due to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore by the grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, man can prolong his \nlife or diminish it. So K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is active in every sphere.

TRANSLATION
O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, know that I am the original seed of all existences, the intelligence of the intelligent, and the prowess of all powerful men.
PURPORTB\xe2\x80\x9djam means seed; K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the seed of everything. In contact with material nature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert. Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert\xc3\x91they cannot move, but only stand. Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them '
b'are moving and some of them are inert. In all cases, however, the seed of their life is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As stated in Vedic literature, Brahman, or the Supreme Absolute Truth, is that from which everything is emanating. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit. Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal. Impersonal Brahman is situated in the personal aspect\xc3\x91that is stated in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Therefore, originally, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the source of everything. He is the root. As the root of a tree maintains the whole tree, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, being the original root of all things, maintains everything in this material manifestation. \nThis is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. "The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born." He is the prime eternal among all eternals. He is the supreme living entity of all living entities, and He alone is maintaining all life. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also says that He is the root of all intelligence. Unless a person is intelligent he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

b'The strong man\xc3\x95s strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression.

PURPORTAll material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature. Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, He is not subject to them. For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law. Similarly, all the modes of material nature\xc3\x91goodness, passion and ignorance\xc3\x91are emanations from the Supreme Lord \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not subject to material nature. Therefore He is nirgu\xe2\x80\x9aa, which means that these gu\xe2\x80\x9aas, or modes, although issuing from Him, do not '
b'affect Him. That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Deluded by the three modes [goodness, passion and ignorance], the whole world does not know Me who am above the modes and inexhaustible.
PURPORTThe whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature. Those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In this material world everyone is under the influence of these three gu\xe2\x80\x9aas and is thus bewildered.Bv nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of \npsychic and biological activities accordingly. There are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature. Those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called k\xc5\x92atriyas. Those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called vai\xe2\x80\x9cyas. Those who are completely in ignorance are called And those who are less than that are animals or animal life. However, '
b'these designations are not permanent. I may either be a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, k\xc5\x92atriya, vai\xe2\x80\x9cya or whatever!in any case, this life is temporary. But although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by the spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian or br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hindu, Muslim, etc. And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is behind all these modes. So Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says that men, deluded \nby these three modes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Godhead.There are many different kinds of living entities!human beings, demigods, animals, etc.!and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead. Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal \nBrahman conception of the Absolute Truth. They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation. When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness are actually liberated.

TRANSLATION
This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome. But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.
PURPORTThe Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is \nalso eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and \nmovement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 tu prak\xe2\x80\x9eti\xe2\x80\xb9 vidy\xe2\x88\x92n m\xe2\x88\x92yina\xe2\x80\xb9 tu mahe\xe2\x80\x9cvaram."Although m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahe\xe2\x80\x9cvara, the \nsupreme controller."Another meaning of gu\xe2\x80\x9aa is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion. A man bound by the '
b'hands and feet cannot free himself\xc3\x91he must be helped by a person who is unbound. Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated. Therefore, only Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul. Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature. Devotional service, or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, can help one gain such release. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul. He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the \nsurrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord. Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.The words m\xe2\x88\x92m eva are also significant. M\xe2\x88\x92m means unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au) only, and not Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 or \xe2\x80\xa1iva. Although Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, it is not possible for such incarnations of r\xe2\x88\x92jo-gu\xe2\x80\x9aa (passion) and tamo-gu\xe2\x80\x9aa (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. In other words, both Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva are also under the influence of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. Only Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is the master of m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92; therefore He can alone give release to the conditioned soul. The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva viditv\xe2\x88\x92 or "Freedom is possible only by understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa." Even Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva says:mukti-prad\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x88\x92 sarve\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aur eva na sa\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9caya\xc5\xa1."There is no doubt that Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.

TRANSLATION
Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.
PURPORTIt is said in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, \nis sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births. But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don't these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?The G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 answers this question very frankly. Those really learned leaders of society like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva, Kapila, the Kum\xe2\x88\x92ras, Manu, Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, Devala, Asita, \nJanaka, Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da, Bali, and later on Madhv\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, R\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92nuj\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Caitanya and many others!who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc.!surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently \ncomplicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them. Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the "
b'unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions."The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etina, or "miscreants." K\xe2\x80\x9etina means one who has performed meritorious work. The \natheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist\xc3\x95s brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etina, which indicates that his \nintelligence and efforts are misdirected.In the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object. But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his \nplans are baffled, as in the case of Hira\xe2\x80\x9ayaka\xe2\x80\x9cipu and R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below:\n(1) The are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast \nof burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know \nfor whom he should work. He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yaj\xc5\x81a (sacrifice).Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such material gains, which are destructible, are life\xc3\x95s all in all!despite the fact that the enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive '
b'gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources. The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee. Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the material world.(2) Another class of du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etina, or miscreant, is called the nar\xe2\x88\x92dhama, or the lowest of mankind. Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest. Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species. Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life \nthat are mostly uncivilized. The civilized human beings are those who have regulated principles of social, political and religious life. Those who are socially and politically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered nar\xe2\x88\x92dhamas. Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man\xc3\x95s relation with Him. In the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth. The \ncivilized form of human life is meant for man\xc3\x95s reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is all-powerful. Whoever loses this chance is classified as a nar\xe2\x88\x92dhama. We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother\xc3\x95s womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out. To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being \nbecause he is eternally related with God. But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, the illusory energy.It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them. The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-sm\xe2\x80\x9eti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama. However, no process '
b'is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is nar\xe2\x88\x92dhama.When the whole population becomes nar\xe2\x88\x92dhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature. According to the standard of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater. That is the vision of a true devotee. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Nity\xe2\x88\x92nanda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical nar\xe2\x88\x92dhamas, the brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind. So the nar\xe2\x88\x92dhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.\xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Caitanya Mah\xe2\x88\x92prabhu, in propagating the bh\xe2\x88\x92gavata-dharma or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead. The essence of this message is Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. \nThe lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Nar\xe2\x88\x92dhamas, or the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being.(3) The next class of du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etina is called m\xe2\x88\x92yay\xe2\x88\x92pah\xe2\x80\x9eta-j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory \nmaterial energy. They are mostly very learned fellows!great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.!but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.There are a great number of m\xe2\x88\x92yay\xe2\x88\x92pah\xe2\x80\x9eta-j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nas at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. In the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, in plain and simple language, it is stated that \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is none equal to or greater than Him. He is mentioned as the father of \nBrahm\xe2\x88\x92, the original father of all human beings. In fact, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is said to be not only the father of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 but also the father of all species of life. He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion. He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet. Despite all these clear statements, the m\xe2\x88\x92yay\xe2\x88\x92pah\xe2\x80\x9eta-j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being. They do not know that the blessed form of '
b'human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.All the unauthorized interpretations of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 by the class of m\xe2\x88\x92yay\xe2\x88\x92pah\xe2\x80\x9eta-j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na, outside the purview of the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system, are so many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding. The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, nor do they teach others to follow this principle.(4) The last class of du\xc5\x92k\xe2\x80\x9etina is called \xe2\x88\x92sura\xe2\x80\xb9 bh\xe2\x88\x92vam \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crita, or those of \ndemonic principles. This class is openly atheistic. Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not. There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain. Such persons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of \nGodhead cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.\xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Y\xe2\x88\x92mun\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya Albandru of South India said, "O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly \nqualities."Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.

TRANSLATION
O best among the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me\xc3\x91the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.
PURPORTUnlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called suk\xe2\x80\x9etina, or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord. Out of these there are four classes of men\xc3\x91\nthose who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth. These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions. These are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service. Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit. The Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. That is called pure devotional service."'
b'When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees. As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals. But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their \ndistress, devotees of the Lord. Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God. Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure \ndevotee. On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees. As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc. So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the \nstage of pure devotional service.

TRANSLATION
Of these, the wise one who is in full knowledge in union with Me through pure devotional service is the best. For I am very dear to him, and he is dear to Me.
PURPORTFree from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the inquisitive, the penniless, and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all become pure devotees. But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure \ndevotee of the Lord. And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best. By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God. So by association with pure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, \nthe seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure. But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord. He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations cannot touch him.

TRANSLATION
All these devotees are undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me I consider verily to dwell in Me. Being engaged in My \ntranscendental service, he attains Me.
PURPORTIt is not that other devotees who are less complete in knowledge are not dear to the Lord. The Lord says that all are magnanimous because anyone who comes to the Lord for any purpose is called a mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 or great soul. The devotees who want some benefit out of devotional service are accepted by the Lord because there is an exchange of affection. Out of affection they ask the \nLord for some material benefit, and when they get it they become so satisfied that they also advance in devotional service. But the devotee in full knowledge is considered to be very dear to the Lord because his only purpose is to serve the Supreme Lord with love and devotion. Such a devotee cannot live a second without contacting or serving the Supreme Lord. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is very fond of His devotee and cannot be separated from him.In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (9.4.57), the Lord says:aha\xe2\x80\xb9 bhakta-par\xe2\x88\x92dh\xe2\x80\x9dno hy asvatantra iva dvijas\xe2\x88\x92dhubhir grasta-h\xe2\x80\x9edayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priya\xc5\xa1"The devotees are always in My heart, and I am always in the heart of the devotees. The devotee does not know anything beyond Me, and I also cannot forget the devotee. There is a very intimate relationship between Me and the pure devotees. Pure devotees in full knowledge are never out of spiritual touch, and therefore they are very much dear to Me."'

TRANSLATION
After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.
PURPORTThe living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one\xc3\x95s attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At \nsuch a time one can understand that Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus he thinks of everything in '
b'relation to V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, or \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such a universal vision of V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva precipitates one\xc3\x95s full surrender to the Supreme Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare.This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad: "In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc. But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord. And because V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva is all-pervading and everything is V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge." (Cf. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 7.17 and 11.40)

Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.
PURPORTThose who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme Lord and engage in His devotional service. As long as the material contamination is not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees. But even those who have material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord '
b'are not so much attracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all material lust. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is recommended that whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee and has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases surrender to V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva and worship Him.It is said in the Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual \nsense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires. Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore \nworship various demigods. Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied. The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not \nmisguided. Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping \ndifferent gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord. But a pure devotee knows \nthat the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the master of all. In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is master and all others \nare servants. Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of \nhis material needs. He depends on the Supreme Lord. And the pure devotee is \nsatisfied with whatever He gives.

TRANSLATION
I am in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some particular deity.
PURPORTGod has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone\xc3\x95s heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons. As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the \nall-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence\xc3\x91whatever one likes\xc3\x91but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him. That will make man happy.\nBoth the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will. As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature. A person wanting some particular thing may worship such \nand such a demigod. For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvat\xe2\x80\x9d; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Um\xe2\x88\x92, the wife of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva. In this way there are recommendations in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods. And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that \nbenediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the '
b'benediction. The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord. The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods. The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence. In the Vedic literature (Taittir\xe2\x80\x9dya Upani\xc5\x92ad, First Anuv\xe2\x88\x92ka) it is stated: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity. But both the demigod and the living entity are dependant on the supreme wil1. They are not independant."

TRANSLATION
Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.
PURPORTThe demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord. The living entity may forget that everything '
b'is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something \nundue is desired by the living entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.\nFor the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments. A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.
PURPORTSome commentators on the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon. Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god\xc3\x95s planet. It is not that \neveryone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by \nworshiping them. However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied. Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food. This isn't very sanguine. Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a \ncompetitor of the Supreme Lord.Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the k\xc5\x92atriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve different functions. Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect. But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets "
b'where the demigods reside. This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.The results achieved by the demigods\xc3\x95 benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable. Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity. Because the pure devotee engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord \nachieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different. The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited. Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.

TRANSLATION
Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, \nwhich is changeless and supreme.'
b'
PURPORTThose who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form. Y\xe2\x88\x92mun\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from R\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x88\x92nuj\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection. He says, "My dear Lord, devotees like Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva and N\xe2\x88\x92rada know You to be \nthe Personality of Godhead. By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You. They are unable to understand You. However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta and the Upani\xc5\x92ads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to \nunderstand the Personality of Godhead."In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta literature. Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known. Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness \nare also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God\xc3\x95s personal nature. Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul!but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead. Modern impersonalists are still less \nintelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, \xe2\x80\xa1a\xef\xac\x81kar\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92rya, who has specifically stated that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be only the son of Devak\xe2\x80\x9d and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity. This is also condemned in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: "Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person." The fact is that no one can understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without '
b'rendering devotional service and without developing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. The G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 confirms this.One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature. One must understand Him by devotional service. When one is fully engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, beginning by chanting the mah\xe2\x88\x92mantra!Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare!then only can one understand the \nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Nondevotee impersonalists think that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything, are m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. These impersonalists are known as M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d. They do not know the ultimate truth.The twentieth verse clearly states: "Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods." It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (Bg. 7.23), and the Lord also has a planet. It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa go to the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka planet. Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions. From the study of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 does it appear that \nthe demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal. They are all persons; Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true. It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed. From the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we can clearly understand that the forms of the \ndemigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda, eternal blissful knowledge. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is \xe2\x88\x92nandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He is abhy\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92t, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities. And in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears. These are the facts that we should understand from the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead \ncan be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as '
b'far as the statements of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 are concerned. It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, has both form and personality.

I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.
PURPORTlt may be argued that since K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present on this earth and was visible to everyone, then why isn\'t He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was not manifest to everyone. When K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when \xe2\x80\xa1i\xe2\x80\x9cup\xe2\x88\x92la spoke against K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa being elected president of the assembly, Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and \nthe common man. Therefore in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to '
b'His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His eternal potency.In the prayers of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (1.8.18), it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d prays: "O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. The brahmajyoti is the \ncovering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge."This yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the \n\xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahm\xe2\x88\x92: "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them." The Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all \ninexhaustible.

TRANSLATION
O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are \nyet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.
PURPORTHere the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the impersonalists to be m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, to be material, then He would, like the living entity, change His body and forget everything in His past life. Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future. Unless one is liberated from material \ncontamination, he cannot know past, present and future.Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future. In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa remembers instructing Vivasv\xe2\x88\x92n, the sun-god, millions of years ago. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being\xc3\x95s heart as the Supreme Soul. But despite His presence in every living entity as \nSupersoul and His presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person. Certainly the transcendental body of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not perishable. He is just like the sun, and may\xe2\x88\x92 is like the cloud. In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets. The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision. The sun, moon and stars are not actually \ncovered. Similarly, m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 cannot cover the Supreme Lord. By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men. As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to '
b'become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is. Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, without being in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata [Arjuna], O conquerer of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, overcome by the dualities of desire and hate.
PURPORTThe real constitutional position of the living entity is that of subordination to the Supreme Lord, who is pure knowledge. When one is deluded into separation from this pure knowledge, he becomes controlled by illusory energy and cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The illusory energy is manifested in the duality of desire and hate. Due to desire and hate, the ignorant person wants to become one with the Supreme Lord and envies K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotees, who are not so deluded or contaminated by desire and hate, can understand that Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appears by His internal potencies, but those who are deluded by duality '
b'and nescience think that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is created by material energies. This is their misfortune. Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking, "This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of this house; I am the husband of this wife." These are the dualities of delusion. Those who are so deluded by dualities are completely foolish and therefore cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination.
PURPORTThose eligible for elevation to the transcendental position are mentioned in this verse. For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate. Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have \nacted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional '
b'service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform. This elevation is possible in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.It is stated in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees; but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence. \nAll the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion. The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violation of God\xc3\x95s law. Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.

Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities.'
b'
PURPORTBirth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service, is really liberated. Aha\xe2\x80\xb9 brahm\xe2\x88\x92smi: I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman\xc3\x91spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are \ntranscendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental and material activities.Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord. But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet. Even the less \nintelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa known as Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. Only persons who perform activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness (m\xe2\x88\x92m \xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9critya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa planet. Such persons have no misgivings about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and thus they are factually Brahman.Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arc\xe2\x88\x92 of the Lord or who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material \nbondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.

TRANSLATION
Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods \nand as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and know Me even at the time of death.
PURPORTPersons acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person can never forget K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana.\nThis Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person. The beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is association of persons who are K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be the Supreme God. At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and becomes entangled in material activities. By gradual \ndevelopment of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature. He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.'
b'Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord. However, he who is actually elevated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness does not care for the different processes. He simply directly engages himself in activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme \nLord in pure devotional service. He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled. This determined faith is called d\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\xb8ha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service. That is the verdict of all scriptures. This Seventh Chapter of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is the substance of that conviction.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventh Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Knowledge of the Absolute.'

TRANSLATION
Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me.
PURPORTIn this chapter Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa answers these different questions of Arjuna beginning with, "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains karma, fruitive activities, devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its pure form. The \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n. In addition, the living entity, individual soul, is also called Brahman. Arjuna also inquires about \n\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, which refers to body, soul and mind. According to the Vedic dictionary, \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Puru\xc5\x92ottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers.

b'How does this Lord of sacrifice live in the body, and in which part does He live, at the time of death?
PURPORTThe Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods. Both Indra and Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au are worshiped by yaj\xc5\x81a performances. But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yaj\xc5\x81a (sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity.\ndemon named Madhu. Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious devotee. Therefore these doubts are like demons. Since K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna\xc3\x95s mind.\nNow the word pray\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-k\xe2\x88\x92le in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death. Arjuna fears that at the time of death, those who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because at such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a panic-stricken state. Therefore Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Kula\xe2\x80\x9cekhara, a great devotee, prays, \xc3\x92My dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I\xc3\x95m healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet.\xc3\x93 This metaphor is used \nbecause the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus flower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the Lord. Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Kula\xe2\x80\x9cekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better to \xc3\x92die immediately.\xc3\x93 Arjuna questions how one\xc3\x95s mind can remain fixed on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s lotus feet at such times.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self. Action pertaining to \nthe development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive activities.
PURPORTBrahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time. But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman. Brahman refers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality \nof Godhead. The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world. In material consciousness, his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa) consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme. When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world. That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.In Vedic literature the living entity is called j\xe2\x80\x9dv\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Brahman, but he is \nnever called Parabrahman. The living entity (j\xe2\x80\x9dv\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92) takes different positions!sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature. Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord\xc3\x95s marginal energy. According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body. In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body. In '
b'material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a beast, bird, etc., according to his karma. To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yaj\xc5\x81a), but when his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.\nln the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them. When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and \ntransformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle. In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path. The K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices. He takes directly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.Impersonalist commentators on the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 unreasonably assume that Brahman \ntakes the form of j\xe2\x80\x9dva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. But this verse also speaks of the living entity as \xc3\x92an eternal fragment of Myself.\xc3\x93 The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down. Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman \nassumes the form of j\xe2\x80\x9dva is not acceptable. It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from \nParabrahman (the Supreme Lord).

TRANSLATION
Physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable. The universe is the cosmic form of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul, \ndwelling in the heart of every embodied being.
PURPORTThe physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is called Because it is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is called adhidaivatam. The individual soul (j\xe2\x80\x9dva) accompanies the \nbody. The Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is called the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 or adhiyaj\xc5\x81a and is situated in the heart. The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul\xc3\x95s activities and is the source of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the j\xe2\x80\x9dva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his \nactivities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service of the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose \nhead is considered the upper planetary system.'

And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.
PURPORTIn this verse the importance of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is stressed. Anyone who quits his body in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord. The word smaran (remembering) is important. Remembrance of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in devotional service. To remember \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa one should chant the mah\xe2\x88\x92mantra, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, incessantly, following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more tolerant than the tree, humbler than the grass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return. In such a way one will be able to depart from the body successfully remembering K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and so attain the supreme goal.

TRANSLATION
Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.
PURPORTThe process of changing one\xc3\x95s nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. How can one die in the proper state of mind? Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Bharata thought of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life. However, as a deer, Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Bharata could remember his past activities. Of course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one\xc3\x95s life influences one\xc3\x95s thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this life determine one\xc3\x95s future state of being. If one is transcendentally absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s service,then his next body will be transcendental \n(spiritual), not physical. Therefore the chanting of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the best process for successfully changing one\xc3\x95s state of being to transcendental life.

PURPORTThis instruction to Arjuna is very important for all men engaged in material activities. The Lord does not say that one should give up his prescribed duties or engagements. One can continue them and at the same time think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O P\xe2\x88\x92rtha [Arjuna], is sure to reach Me.
PURPORTIn this verse Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa stresses the importance of remembering Him. One\xc3\x95s memory of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is revived by chanting the mah\xe2\x88\x92mantra, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one\xc3\x95s ear, tongue and mind are engaged. This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord. Puru\xc5\x92am means enjoyer. Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination. They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer. Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, etc.The devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features, N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, R\xe2\x88\x92ma, etc., by chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant \nchanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God. Yoga practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa one \nfixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord. The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life. Similarly, if we constantly think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same \nbodily constitution as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person. He is luminous \nlike the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material nature.
PURPORTThe process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse. The foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void. One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, He is puru\xc5\x92a, spiritual, R\xe2\x88\x92ma and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He \nknows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the \nheart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is '
b'sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The word acintya (inconceivable) is very significant in this connection. God\xc3\x95s energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world\xc3\x91so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot \ntouch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and follow the principles they set down.

TRANSLATION
One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord, will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
PURPORTIn this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead. For those practiced in yoga, it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure devotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace. This is explained in verse fourteen.The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because without practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death. One cannot \nsuddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death unless he is practiced in some yoga system, especially the system of bhakti-yoga. Since one\xc3\x95s mind at death is very disturbed, one should \npractice transcendence through yoga during one\xc3\x95s life.

TRANSLATION
Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omk\xe2\x88\x92ra and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman. Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy. I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain \nsalvation.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different manifestations and features. For the impersonalists, the syllable om is identical with Brahman. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the renounced order of sages enter.In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy. In this way they realize two of Brahman\xc3\x95s features. This practice is very essential for the student\xc3\x95s advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible. The social construction of the world has \nchanged so much that there is no possibility of one\xc3\x95s practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life. Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d principles. Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult. Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no process of realizing the Supreme is \npossible except the chanting of the holy name of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa: Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare.

TRANSLATION
The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements. Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at \nthe top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.
PURPORTTo practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called praty\xe2\x88\x92h\xe2\x88\x92ra, or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this \npractice is not practical in this age. The best process is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in sam\xe2\x88\x92dhi.

After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinke of the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets.
PURPORTIt is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are not different. The impersonal sound of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is om, but the sound Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa contains om. It is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mah\xe2\x88\x92mantra, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he will reach the spiritual planets.

TRANSLATION
For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.
PURPORTln this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Godhead is described. The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees\xc3\x91the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers. Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have also been described: karma-yoga, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga. But here bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned. In bhakti-yoga the devotees desire nothing but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The pure bhakti devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire \nanything. In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta the pure devotee is called ni\xc5\x92k\xe2\x88\x92ma, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme Lord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain. The devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas. Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform. One can begin by simply chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is. The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without considering the time or place. There should be no impediments. He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time. Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana by his devotional service. It was \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, \xc3\x92Wherever You are, O Lord!there is V\xe2\x80\x9endavana.\xc3\x93'
b'A pure devotee constantly remembers K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and meditates upon Him. These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable. Bhakti-yoga is the system that the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 recommends above all others. Generally, the bhakti-yog\xe2\x80\x9ds are engaged in five different ways: 1) \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92nta-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2) d\xe2\x88\x92sya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; 3) s\xe2\x88\x92khya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) v\xe2\x88\x92tsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and 5) m\xe2\x88\x92dhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord. In any of these ways, the pure devotee is \nalways constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained. A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment. This is the great blessing of the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious process of chanting the mah\xe2\x88\x92mantra, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

PURPORTSince this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, does not wish to return. The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as beyond our material vision, and it is considered the highest goal. The mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92s (great souls) receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus \ngradually develop devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and become so \nabsorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet. They only want K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s association and nothing else. Such great souls in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness attain the highest perfection of life.

Those who attain the highest material planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated birth and death. As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth. The practice of sacrifice called pa\xc5\x81c\xe2\x88\x92gni-vidy\xe2\x88\x92, recommended \nin the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then he must return to earth. Those who progress in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom.

PURPORTThe duration of the material universe is limited. It is manifested in cycles of kalpas. A kalpa is a day of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, and one day of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 consists of a thousand cycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Tret\xe2\x88\x92, Dv\xe2\x88\x92para, and Kali. The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years. In the Tret\xe2\x88\x92-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years. In the Dv\xe2\x88\x92para-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice \nincreasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years. And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years. In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His \ndevotees, and commences another Satya-yuga. Then the process is set rolling \nagain. These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the creator god, and the same number comprise one night. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 lives one hundred of such \xc3\x92years\xc3\x93 and then dies. These \xc3\x92hundred years\xc3\x93 by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million earth years. By these calculations the life of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash. In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahm\xe2\x88\x92s rising and disappearing like bubbles in the \nAtlantic. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.In the material universe not even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe!therefore he at once attains liberation. Elevated sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds are promoted to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and \nwhich survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and all inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature.'

When Brahm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s day is manifest, this multitude of living entities comes into being, and at the arrival of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s night they are all annihilated.
PURPORTThe less intelligent j\xe2\x80\x9dvas try to remain within this material world and are accordingly elevated and degraded in the various planetary systems. During the daytime of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 they exhibit their activities, and at the coming of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s night they are annihilated. In the day they receive various bodies for material activities, and at night these bodies perish.

PURPORTThe supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is described in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 as cint\xe2\x88\x92ma\xe2\x80\x9ai-dh\xe2\x88\x92ma, a place where all desires are fulfilled. The supreme abode of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa known as Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana is full of palaces made of touchstone. There are also trees which are called \xc3\x92desire trees\xc3\x93 that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which supply a limitless supply of milk. In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Lak\xc5\x92m\xe2\x80\x9ds), and He is \ncalled Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes. The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (venum kvanantam). His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds\xc3\x91His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 Lord Kr\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gives only a small hint of His personal abode (Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana) which is the supermost planet in the \nspiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92. Vedic literature states that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme \nGodhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination. When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s supreme abode and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth, V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana located in the spiritual sky. When K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa descended on this earth, He sported \non that particular tract of land known as V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana in the district of Mathur\xe2\x88\x92, India.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is greater than all, is attainable by unalloyed devotion. Although He is present in His abode, He is all-pervading, and everything is situated within Him.
PURPORTIt is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no return is the abode of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Person. The Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 describes this supreme abode as \xe2\x88\x92nanda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss. Whatever variegatedness is manifest there \nis all of the quality of spiritual bliss\xc3\x91there is nothing material. All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere\xc3\x91both in the material and in the spiritual universes. \nYasy\xe2\x88\x92nta\xc5\xa1sth\xe2\x88\x92ni means that everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.It is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha (spiritual) planetary system. In all the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1has there is only one Supreme Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions. These plenary expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets. They are known by a \nvariety of names!Puru\xc5\x92ottama, Trivikrama, Ke\xe2\x80\x9cava, M\xe2\x88\x92dhava, Aniruddha, H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, Sa\xef\xac\x81kar\xc5\x92a\xe2\x80\x9aa, Pradyumna, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9ddhara, V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, D\xe2\x88\x92modara, Jan\xe2\x88\x92rdana, N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, V\xe2\x88\x92mana, Padman\xe2\x88\x92bha, etc. These plenary expansions are likened '
b'unto the leaves of a tree, and the main tree is likened to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, dwelling in Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-pervasiveness.

O best of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas, I shall now explain to you the different times at which, passing away from this world, one does or does not come back.
PURPORTThe unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered souls do not care when they leave their bodies or by what method. They leave everything in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead. But \nthose who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death.If the yog\xe2\x80\x9d is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature\xc3\x95s will. The most suitable time to leave the body and not return is being explained by the Lord '

TRANSLATION
Those who know the Supreme Brahman pass away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment, during the fortnight of the moon and the six months when the sun travels in the north.
PURPORTWhen fire, light, day and moon are mentioned, it is to be understood that over all of them there are various presiding deities who make arrangements for the passage of the soul. At the time of death, the j\xe2\x80\x9dva sets forth on the path to a new life. If one leaves the body at the time designated above, either accidently or by arrangement, it is possible for him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti. Mystics who are advanced in yoga practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body. Others have no control\xc3\x91if by accident they leave at an auspicious moment, then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death, but if not, then there is every possibility that they will have to return. \nHowever, for the pure devotee in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there is no fear of '
b'returning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or arrangement.

These elevated souls live on the moon for about 10,000 years (by demigod calculations) and enjoy life by drinking soma-rasa. They eventually return to earth. This means that on the moon there are higher classes of living beings, though they may not be perceived by the gross senses.

PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world. A devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart either by arrangement or by accident. The devotee should be firmly established in Kr\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness and chant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome. The best way to be absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one\xc3\x95s path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain, and direct. The word yoga-yukta is especially significant in this verse. One who is firm in yoga is constantly \nthat one should be unattached in the material world and that all affairs should \nbe steeped in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In this way one attains perfection. Therefore the devotee is not disturbed by these descriptions because he knows that his passage to the supreme abode is guaranteed by devotional service.

TRANSLATION
A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity \nor pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities. At the end he reaches the \nsupreme abode.
PURPORTThis verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and devotional service. One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care. A brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master. He takes food only under the master\xc3\x95s order, and if the master neglects to call \nthe student for food that day, the student fasts. These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character. Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of \ncharacter. After this training, the brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d is allowed to enter into household life and marry. When he is a householder, he also has to perform \nmany sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment. Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha, he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc. By carrying out the orders of brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d, householder, v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha and finally sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life. Some are then '
b'elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka. This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.The beauty of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees. Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. If one is fortunate to understand the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92!especially these middle six \nchapters!in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc. One should hear the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the G\xe2\x80\x9dta can only be perfectly understood by devotees. Hearing the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith. \nThrough association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled. Then once doubts are removed, the study of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness. In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee\xc3\x95s transferral to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka \nV\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eighth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Attaining the Supreme.'

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.
PURPORTAs a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened. This hearing process is recommended in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam: \xc3\x92The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees. This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge.\xc3\x93\nThe devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord\xc3\x95s service. The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in the association of the devotees. Discussion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization. Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and \nhigher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.The very beginning of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential. Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, they are called \nmore confidential. But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion. Therefore this is called the most confidential. One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world. In the Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered '
b'liberated. Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.Now this first verse has specific significance. Knowledge (ida\xe2\x80\xb9 j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam) refers to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything. By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. At the time when one\xc3\x95s heart is cleared of the material \ncontamination, one can understand this science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient. That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands that he is not the body.In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and \nsuperior natures, and all this material manifestation. Now in Chapters Nine and Ten the glories of the Lord will be delineated.The Sanskrit word in this verse is also very significant. Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even the most erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 very inaccurately. Because they are envious of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, their commentaries are useless. The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are \nbona fide. No one can explain Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, or give perfect knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa if he is envious. One who criticizes the character of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without knowing Him is a fool. So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided. For one who understands that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.

TRANSLATION
This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.
PURPORTThis chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before. There are seven principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Ka\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92da, Kapila, Y\xe2\x88\x92j\xc5\x81avalkya, \xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8ilya, Vai\xe2\x80\x9cv\xe2\x88\x92nara, and, finally, Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva, the author of the  So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental \nknowledge. Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy. It is the most confidential because \nconfidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body. And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge. As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc. There are so many \ndepartments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the '
b'science of the spirit soul is instructed. Yet the soul is the most important part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value. Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul. In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable. That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that \nits nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal. But that gives no positive information about the soul. Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal. But actually that is not the fact. How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active. If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual \nkingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge. These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic literature. In the Padma Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, man\xc3\x95s sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions. For \ninstance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time. It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree. Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify. There are different stages. The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action \nare still enjoyed. There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse of the Seventh Chapter.A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme '
b'Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions. For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish. Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest. Uttamam means transcendental. Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam means that which is transcendental to material activities. \nDevotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men. One who can see and is familiar with devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities. They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly. This direct result is actually perceived, and we \nhave practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination. This is actually seen. Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he \ngradually feels spiritual progress. This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification. The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.In the  this is also described in the following words: prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9c ca karma\xe2\x80\x9ay abhy\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92t. \xc3\x92Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt.\xc3\x93 N\xe2\x88\x92rada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor \nwas he born into a high family. But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, N\xe2\x88\x92rada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself. N\xe2\x88\x92rada personally says, \xc3\x92Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated. Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.5.25) N\xe2\x88\x92rada tells his disciple Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva '
b'that in a previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them. Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants. So he asked the great devotees whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission. N\xe2\x88\x92rada then ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions. As he went on eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually developed the same taste. The great devotees relished \nthe taste of unceasing devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the same taste, N\xe2\x88\x92rada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Thus by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional service. Therefore he quotes from the (prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\x9c ca karma\xe2\x80\x9ay abhy\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92t): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand. This is called prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ca\xc5\xa1, directly perceived.\nN\xe2\x88\x92rada was actually a son of a maidservant. He had no opportunity to go to school. He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees. The child N\xe2\x88\x92rada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional service. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is said that religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service. Generally Vedic knowledge is \nrequired for the understanding of the path of self-realization. But here, although he was not educated in the Vedic principle, N\xe2\x88\x92rada acquired the highest results of Vedic study. This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection. How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryav\xe2\x88\x92n puru\xc5\x92o veda. One who is in association with great \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas, even if he is not educated or has not studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the \nknowledge necessary for realization.The process of devotional service is a very happy one. Why? Devotional service consists of \xe2\x80\x9crava\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 k\xe2\x80\x9drtana\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ao\xc5\xa1, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas. Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes. In every state devotional service is joyful. One can execute '
b'devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition. The Lord says, patra\xe2\x80\xb9 pu\xc5\x92pa\xe2\x80\xb9 phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what. Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love. There \nare many instances in history. Simply by tasting the tulas\xe2\x80\x9d leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkum\xe2\x88\x92ra became great devotees. Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a \nhappy mood. God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing. It is not as the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d philosophers claim. They sometimes take to so-called devotional service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they \xc3\x92become one with God.\xc3\x93 Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service. Actual devotional service continues even after liberation. \nWhen the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord. He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation. So in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is said, After being liberated, or being situated in the Brahman position, one\xc3\x95s devotional service begins. By executing devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord. No one can \nunderstand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na, or a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga or any other yoga independantly. Without coming to \nthe stage of devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam or Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from realized souls, then he can understand the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or the science of God. Eva\xe2\x80\xb9 prasanna-manaso \nbhagavad-bhakti-yogata\xc5\xa1. When one\xc3\x95s heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is. Thus the process of devotional service, of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge. It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty. Therefore one should adopt it.'

TRANSLATION
Those who are not faithful on the path of devotional service cannot attain Me, O conqueror of foes, but return to birth and death in this material world.
PURPORTThe faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse. Faith is created by association with devotees. Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God. They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus faith is a most \nimportant factor for progress in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In the Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta it is said that one should have complete conviction that simply by \nserving the Supreme Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa he can achieve all perfection. That is called real faith. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, \nall the demigods and all the living entities automatically become satisfied.After reading Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service '
b'of the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Personality of Godhead. If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith. Now the development of that faith is the process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.There are three divisions of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious men. In the third class are those who have no faith. If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage. Most probably they will slip, after some time. They may become engaged, but because they haven\xc3\x95t complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for \nthem to continue in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways again. It is only by faith that one can advance in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of \nfirm faith is called a first-class person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa bhakti or service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up. \nThus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow. The third-class person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness may fall down, but when \none is in the second class or first class, he does not fall down. One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end. As far as the third-class person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very good, he has no knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa through the scriptures like \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Sometimes these third-class persons in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, and sometimes they \nare disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Faith in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is also divided into three stages and described in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam in the Eleventh Canto. Those who have no faith even after hearing about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find '
b'the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service. For them there is very little hope in gaining perfection. Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.

TRANSLATION
By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
PURPORTThe Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses. It is said that Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses. Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated, prem\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x81janacchurita.\xc3\x89 One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him. Thus for people in general He is not visible. Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is yet not conceivable by the material senses. But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him. As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic '
b'manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy. Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence. To refute such argument the Lord says, \xc3\x92I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof.\xc3\x93 For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king\xc3\x95s energy; the different \ngovernmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king\xc3\x95s power. But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally. That is a crude example. Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, He is everywhere \npresent by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.

TRANSLATION
And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.
PURPORTThe Lord says that everything is resting on Him. This should not be misunderstood. The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is \nresting on Him, still He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, \xc3\x92Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I am aloof from them.\xc3\x93 This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.In the Vedic dictionary it is said, \xc3\x92The Supreme Lord is performing \ninconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy. His person is full of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact. In this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood.\xc3\x93 We may think to do something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like. But when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done. The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and \nsustainer of all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation. Simply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated. There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit. Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally. He is different from this \nmaterial manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him. This is explained '
b'here as yogam ai\xe2\x80\x9cvaram, the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me.
PURPORTFor the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him. But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive. The cosmic manifestation rests in space. Space permits the movement of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon. Although the \nsky (or wind or air) is great, still it is situated within space. Space is not beyond the sky.Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is '
b'being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere. In the Upani\xc5\x92ads, it is stated, \xc3\x92It is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing.\xc3\x93 In the Garga Upani\xc5\x92ad also it is stated, \xc3\x92By the supreme order, under the superintendence of the \nSupreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are moving.\xc3\x93 In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 this is also stated. There is also a description of the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse \nheat and light. Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda. So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.

b'The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation is completely dependant on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead. \xc3\x92At the end of the millennium\xc3\x93 means at the death of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years. His night is of the same duration. His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months. After one hundred such years, when Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the \nSupreme Lord is again wound up in Himself. Then again, when there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: \xc3\x92Although I am one, I shall become many.\xc3\x93 This is the Vedic aphorism. He expands Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place.

TRANSLATION
The whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will it is manifested again and again, and by My will it is annihilated at the end.
PURPORTThis matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This has already been explained several times. At the '
b'creation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord as His first Puru\xc5\x92a incarnation, Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, enters. He lies within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Each universe is in that way created. He still further manifests Himself as K\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9drodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and that Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au enters into everything\xc3\x91even into the minute atom. This fact is explained here. He enters into everything.Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this \nmaterial nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions. Thus the activities of this material world begin. The activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation. It is not that all is evolved. The different species of life are created immediately along with the universe. Men, animals, beasts, birds!everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living entities had at \nthe last annihilation are again manifested. It is clearly stated here that the \nliving entities have nothing to do with this process. The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will. This is the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God. And after creating different species of life, He has no connection with them. The creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become involved with it.

O Dhana\xc5\x81jaya, all this work cannot bind Me. I am ever detached, seated as though neutral.
PURPORTOne should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no engagement. In His spiritual world He is always engaged. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated: \xc3\x92He is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.\xc3\x93 \nMaterial activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality is explained here. Although He has control over every minute detail of matter, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening: someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth\xc3\x91but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that \ngain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In the it is stated that He is not situated in the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn\xc3\x95t interfere with them.

TRANSLATION
This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.
PURPORTIt is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also states in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that of all the living entities in different forms and species, \xc3\x92I am the Father.\xc3\x93 The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the \nchild, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created \nimmediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the sm\xe2\x80\x9eti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has \nnothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the '
b'Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities.

TRANSLATION
Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.
PURPORTFrom the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man. The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being. Yet there are many foolish men who \nconsider K\xe2\x80\x9e,s\xe2\x80\x9aa to be merely a powerful man and nothing more. Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 (i\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9es\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1); He is the Supreme Lord.\nThere are many \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another. In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president. Each of them is a controller, but one is '
b'controlled by another. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is said that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme controller (\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara\xc5\xa1 parama\xc5\xa1 k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1), and His body is sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda, non-material.\nMaterial bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses. His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man. His body is called here m\xe2\x88\x92nu\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dm because He is acting just like a man, a friend of \nArjuna\xc3\x95s, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra. In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha!eternal bliss and knowledge absolute. This is confirmed in the Vedic \nlanguage also  \xc3\x92I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge.\xc3\x93 There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also. Tam eka\xe2\x80\xb9 govindam: \xc3\x92You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows.\xc3\x93 Sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraham: \xc3\x92And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality.\xc3\x93Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 who deride K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as an ordinary man. The scholar may be born an \nextraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is due to a poor fund of knowledge. Therefore he is called for only foolish persons consider K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies. They do not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone. Because they do not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead \nin this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy. He is the master of the material energy. As has been explained in several places (mama m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 duratyay\xe2\x88\x92), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, \nis under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy. If a soul surrendered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic '
b'nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is complete foolishness. Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form. The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute. Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation. It is clearly stated concerning \nHis yogam ai\xe2\x80\x9cvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them. Although the foolish cannot imagine how K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.\nThere are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord\xc3\x95s appearance as a human being. But if we consult Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science \nof K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, then we can understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages inquire about the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, it is stated that His \nappearance as a man bewilders the foolish. No human being could perform the wonderful acts that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa performed while He was present on this earth. When K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child. His appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body. In the Eleventh Chapter of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 also it is stated, etc. Arjuna \nprayed to see again that form of four hands, and when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form. All these different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.Some of those who deride K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who are infected with the M\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92v\xe2\x88\x92d\xe2\x80\x9d philosophy, quote the following verse from the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam to prove that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is just an ordinary man: '
b'sad\xe2\x88\x92: \xc3\x92The Supreme is present in every living entity.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 3.29.21) We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas like J\xe2\x80\x9dva Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons \nwho deride K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. J\xe2\x80\x9dva Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d, commenting on this verse, says that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, in His plenary expansion as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the \nform of the Lord in the temple. There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage. The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so J\xe2\x80\x9dva Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected. A devotee should see that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is present in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect \neach and every body in whom the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 dwells. Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship. They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness knows that although K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the \nSupreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92. Although His personal abode is Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana and He is always \nstaying there, still, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion, He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.

Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demonic and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities, and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.
PURPORTThere are many devotees who assume themselves to be in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as the Absolute Truth. For them, the fruit of devotional service\xc3\x91going back to Godhead\xc3\x91will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In other words, persons who mock K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are to be understood to be demonic or \natheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, such demonic miscreants never surrender to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to \nbecome one with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the and the Upani\xc5\x92ads, is always baffled.It is a great offense, therefore, to consider K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In the B\xe2\x80\x9ehad-'
b'vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava mantra it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the \xe2\x80\x9cruti. And if one by chance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges \nto rid himself of infection. People jeer at K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation.

TRANSLATION
O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service \nbecause they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and \ninexhaustible.
PURPORTIn this verse the description of mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is clearly given. The first sign of the mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is that he is already situated in the divine nature. He is not under the control of material nature. And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of '
b'Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature. That is the qualification. One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the preliminary formula. Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature. The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daiv\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\xb9 prak\xe2\x80\x9etim, divine nature. So, when one is promoted in that way\xc3\x91by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead\xc3\x91one attains to the \nstage of great soul, mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92.The mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 does not divert his attention to anything outside K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because he knows perfectly well that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. There is no doubt about it. Such a mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, or great soul, develops through association with other mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92s, pure devotees. Pure devotees are not even attracted by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s other features, such as the four-armed Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Since they are not attracted to other features of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (what to speak of the demigods), they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being. They only meditate upon K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.

TRANSLATION
Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.
PURPORTThe mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man. His symptoms are described here: a mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Personality of Godhead. He has no other business. He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord. In other words, he is not an impersonalist. When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes. One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nOne who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the brahmajyoti, is not described as mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 in the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. He is described in a different way in the next verse. The mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, hearing and chanting about Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, not a demigod or human \nbeing. That is devotion: \xe2\x80\x9crava\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 k\xe2\x80\x9drtana\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ao\xc5\xa1, smara\xe2\x80\x9aam, and remembering Him. Such a mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 has firm determination to achieve at the \nultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas. To achieve that success, he engages all activities!mental, bodily and vocal, everything!in the service of the Supreme Lord, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is called full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ek\xe2\x88\x92da\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d, and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc. All these rules and regulations are offered by the great \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world. The mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92s, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood. One does not need to '
b'undergo any severe penance and austerity. He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, or a brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9d; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, a great soul.

TRANSLATION
Others, who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, diverse in many, and in the universal form.
PURPORTThis verse is the summary of the previous verses. The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and do not know anything other than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are called mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92; yet there are other persons who are not \nexactly in the position of mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 but who worship K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also, in different ways. Some of them are already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who '
b'accepts the universal form, the of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class \nincludes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord.

TRANSLATION
But it is I who am the ritual, I the sacrifice, the offering to the ancestors, the healing herb, the transcendental chant. I am the butter and the fire and the offering.'
b'
PURPORTThe sacrifice known as jyoti\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1oma is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He is also the mah\xe2\x88\x92-yaj\xc5\x81a The oblations offered to the Pit\xe2\x80\x9eloka or the sacrifice performed to please the Pit\xe2\x80\x9eloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The mantras chanted in this connection are also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The fire is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In other \nwords, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-k\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a division of the Vedas are in total also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the Vedas.

PURPORTThe entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy. In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s marginal energy, but under the creation of prak\xe2\x80\x9eti some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In this verse the word dh\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x88\x92 means creator. Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but their creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. All the Vedas, therefore, aim only toward K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is but a progressive step to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and \nparcel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and as such is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In all the Vedic mantras the word om, called pra\xe2\x80\x9aava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. And \nbecause in all the hymns of the four Vedas, S\xe2\x88\x92ma, Yajur, \xe2\x80\xa0g and Atharva, the pra\xe2\x80\x9aava or omk\xe2\x88\x92ra is very prominent, it is understood to be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.
PURPORTGati means the destination where we want to go. But the ultimate goal is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, although people do not know it. One who does not know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets lokas or planets, being creations of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, are simultaneously K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and not K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Actually such planets, being the manifestations of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy, are also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. To approach the different energies of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is to approach K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa indirectly. One should directly approach K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, for that will save time and energy. For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is \nresting on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy; therefore without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s shelter nothing can exist. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, being situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection \nmust be a living force. Thus K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme living entity. Since K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.'

O Arjuna, I control heat, the rain and the drought. I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both being and nonbeing are in Me.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun. During summer season it is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa who checks rain from falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa meets us at the end as death. By \nanalyzing all these different energies of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one can acertain that for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and spirit. In the advanced stage of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one does not therefore make such distinctions. He sees K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa only in everything.Since K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and His pastimes in V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana as two-handed \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead.'

TRANSLATION
Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. They take birth on the planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.
PURPORTThe word trai-vidy\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 refers to the three Vedas, S\xe2\x88\x92ma, Yajur and \xe2\x80\xa0g. A br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa who has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-ved\xe2\x80\x9d. Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society. Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them. Therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa herein \ndeclares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the tri-ved\xe2\x80\x9ds. Actual tri-ved\xe2\x80\x9ds take \nshelter under the lotus feet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord. Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa mantra and side by side trying to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in truth. Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the Vedas become '
b'more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc. By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc. Once situated on those higher planetary systems, one can satisfy his senses hundreds of thousands of times better than on this planet.

When they have thus enjoyed heavenly sense pleasure, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus, through the Vedic principles, they achieve only \nflickering happiness.
PURPORTOne who is promoted to those higher planetary systems enjoys a longer duration of life and better facilities for sense enjoyment, yet one is not allowed '
b'to stay there forever. One is again sent back to this earthly planet upon finishing the resultant fruits of pious activities. He who has not attained perfection of knowledge, as indicated in the yata\xc5\xa1), or, in other words, he who fails to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the cause of all causes, becomes baffled in achieving the ultimate goal of life and is thus subjected to the routine of being promoted to the higher planets and then again coming down, as if situated on a ferris wheel which sometimes goes up and sometimes comes down. The purport is that instead of being elevated to \nthe spiritual world where there is no longer any possibility of coming down, one simply revolves in the cycle of birth and death on higher and lower planetary systems. One should better take to the spiritual world to enjoy eternal life full of bliss and knowledge and never return to this miserable material existence.

PURPORTOne who is unable to live for a moment without K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness cannot but think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all auspicious and full of spiritual potencies; indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. This is called yoga. By the mercy of the Lord, such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. K\xc5\x92ema refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by yoga, and when he becomes fully K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life.

PURPORT\xc3\x92Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent, although such worship is done to Me indirectly,\xc3\x93 K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says. For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles. Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach. The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme \nLord. One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors. Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only. That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord. The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal. This is stated here as In other words, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa does not approve the unnecessary worship of the demigods.

PURPORTHere it is clearly stated that there are many types of yaj\xc5\x81a performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord. Yaj\xc5\x81a means Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yaj\xc5\x81a or Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. The perfectional form of human civilization, known as var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Therefore, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says in this verse, \xc3\x92I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master.\xc3\x93 \nHowever, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit. Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life. If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.

PURPORTIf anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose. These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as dar\xe2\x80\x9ca-paur\xe2\x80\x9aam\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets. Similarly, one can attain the pit\xe2\x88\x92 planets by performing a specific yaj\xc5\x81a. Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yak\xc5\x92a, rak\xc5\x92a or pi\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92ca. Pi\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92ca worship is called \xc3\x92black arts\xc3\x93 or \xc3\x92black magic.\xc3\x93 There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pit\xe2\x88\x92 achieve the pit\xe2\x88\x92 \nplanets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au live, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti. This K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa mantra one can \nbecome perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.

TRANSLATION
If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will accept it.
PURPORTHere Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered. If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life\xc3\x91\nthe transcendental loving service of God\xc3\x91then he should find out what the Lord desires of him. One who loves K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for. Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so. Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, \xc3\x92I will accept it.\xc3\x93 Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and \neggs. Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself. Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it. Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material \nentanglement. Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin. In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature. But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear \nthinking. Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love. '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way. The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the \nspeaker of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. But, in actuality, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, \nand it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other. This is what it means to say that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is absolute. Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences. In the Seventh Chapter, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature. This is done by His looking upon material nature. And so in this instance, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s hearing the devotee\xc3\x95s words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting. This \npoint should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting. Only the devotee, who accepts K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.

O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.
PURPORTThus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa recommends, \n\xc3\x92Do it for Me,\xc3\x93 and this is called arcan\xe2\x88\x92. Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says, \xc3\x92Give it to Me,\xc3\x93 and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in furthering the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest yog\xe2\x80\x9d, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.

TRANSLATION
In this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds, and by this principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me.
PURPORTOne who acts in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness under superior direction is called yukta. The technical term is yukta-vair\xe2\x88\x92gyaGosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d as follows. we cannot cease acting. Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, then that is called yukta-vair\xe2\x88\x92gya. Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore at the end he \nbecomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified. By this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord. It is clearly mentioned here: m\xe2\x88\x92m upai\xc5\x92yasi, \xc3\x92he comes to Me,\xc3\x93 back home, back to Godhead. There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and \nengage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord. As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord. Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord. He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas. For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.It is said, therefore, by Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee. The '
b'exact words are vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aavera kriy\xe2\x88\x92 mudr\xe2\x88\x92 vij\xc5\x81e n\xe2\x88\x92 bujhay\xe2\x88\x92. A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the future. His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. He is above all materialistic criticism, just as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is above all criticism.

TRANSLATION
I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend \nto him.
PURPORTOne may question here that if K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord \nclaims that every living entity\xc3\x91in whatever form\xc3\x91is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just '
b'like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The very phrase K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly, \xc3\x92mayi te,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92in Me.\xc3\x93 Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This \nalso explains the words: asti na priya\xc5\xa1/ye bhajanti: \xc3\x92Whoever surrenders unto \nMe, proportionately I take care of him.\xc3\x93 This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes \nthe devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies. But here the explanation is more complete. The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees. This is \nthe manifestation of the Lord\xc3\x95s special mercy to the devotees. The Lord\xc3\x95s reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma. It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees \nfunction. Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.

TRANSLATION
Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.
PURPORTThe word sudur\xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ro used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could \ndisrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is '
b'stated that if a person falls down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even a yog\xe2\x80\x9d fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as is explained in the next verse, \nsuch occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.Therefore a person who is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen. The words s\xe2\x88\x92dhur eva, \xc3\x92he is saintly,\xc3\x93 are very \nemphatic. They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally. And the word mantavya\xc5\xa1 is still more emphatic. If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord. The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.\nThe mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment to the moonlight. Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abominable. On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections. Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory \nenergy. As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns. But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained. No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee. If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.'

TRANSLATION
He quickly becomes righteous and attains lasting peace. O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.
PURPORTThis should not be misunderstood. In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord. One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities\xc3\x91either by accident or intention\xc3\x91be a pure devotee? \nThis question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him \npure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position, he has to undergo certain ritualistic '
b'processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.

O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth\xc3\x91\nsupreme destination.
PURPORTIt is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people. In the material conception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person engaged \nin transcendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that '
b'even the lowest, who are called ca\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92las (dog-eaters), can be elevated by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking center of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas), the mode of passion (k\xc5\x92atriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vai\xe2\x80\x9cyas, or merchants), and the mode \nof ignorance or workers). Those lower than them are called ca\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92las, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, those who are born in sinful families are not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service and the pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes center of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One has to take center completely of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Then one can become much greater than great j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x80\x9ds and yog\xe2\x80\x9ds.

How much greater then are the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, the righteous, the devotees and saintly kings who in this temporary miserable world engage in loving service unto Me.
PURPORTIn this material world there are classifications of people, but, after all, this world is not a happy place for anyone. It is clearly stated here, anityam asukha\xe2\x80\xb9 lokam: this world is temporary and full of miseries, not habitable for any sane gentleman. This world is declared by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be temporary and full of miseries. Some of the philosophers, especially the minor philosophers, say that this world is false, but we can \nunderstand from Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that the world is not false; it is temporary. There is a difference between temporary and false. This world is temporary, but there is another world which is eternal. This world is miserable, but the other world is eternal and blissful.Arjuna was born in a saintly royal family. To him also the Lord says, \xc3\x92Take to My devotional service and come quickly back to Godhead, back home.\xc3\x93 No one should remain in this temporary world, full as it is with miseries. Everyone \nshould attach himself to the bosom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that he can be eternally happy. The devotional service of the Supreme Lord is the only process by which all problems of all classes of men can be solved. Everyone should therefore take to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and make his life perfect.

PURPORTIn this verse it is clearly indicated that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world. Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible. Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s mind and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth. His body, mind and He Himself are one and absolute. It is stated in the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddh\xe2\x88\x92nta Sarasvat\xe2\x80\x9d Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d in his Anubh\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92ya comments on Caitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92mrta, Fifth Chapter, \xe2\x80\xa2di-l\xe2\x80\x9dl\xe2\x88\x92, verses 41\xc3\x9048, \n\xc3\x92deha-dehi-vibhedo \xc3\x95ya\xe2\x80\xb9 ne\xe2\x80\x9cvare vidyate kvacit,\xc3\x93 which means that there is no difference in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body. But, because they do not know this science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the commentators hide K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and divide His personality from His mind or from His body. Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, some men make profit out of \nmisleading the people.There are some who are demonic; they also think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but enviously, just like King Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s uncle. He was also thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa always, but he thought of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as his enemy. He was always in anxiety, wondering when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa would come to kill him. That kind of thinking will not help us. One should be thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in devotional love. That is bhakti. One should cultivate the knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa continually. What is that favorable \ncultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme '
b'Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge. This kind of talk about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa will help one become a devotee. Otherwise, understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from the wrong source will prove fruitless.One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; with conviction in his heart that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship. There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and devotional service is practiced there. \nWhen such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities!everything. That will make one fully absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without deviation. This will help one transfer into the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka. One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators. One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human \nsociety.In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, pure devotional service to the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or fruitive activities. Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the \nSupreme Lord.\nThere is a beautiful poem about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yog\xe2\x80\x9ds. One who always engages in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person. His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon \nbe situated without any doubt in complete perfection. The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees. Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to this process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and happily live in this material world. He will eventually receive the supreme award of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'
b'Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Ninth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Most Confidential Knowledge.'

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.
PURPORTThe word paramam is explained thus by Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara Muni: one who is full in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. While K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences. Therefore great sages like Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara Muni have all accepted K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is instructing Arjuna in more confidential \nknowledge of His opulences and His work. Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how they are acting. Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna. In the previous chapter he has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction. Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in \ndevotional service. One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one\xc3\x95s devotional service. Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Others cannot take part in such discourses. The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place.

Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.
PURPORTAs stated in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Even the demigods and the \ngreat sages have tried to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by such foolish \nspeculation.Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, \xc3\x92Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.\xc3\x93 One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. The \nimpersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the '
b'inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.Because most men cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord\xc3\x95s uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. \nThe devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, they can understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree: What is \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.

PURPORTAs stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men. They are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person. In that stage only, when one has fully understood K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam. The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to \nmaterial attachment. The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable. Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in the superior energy.He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation. All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is \nconcerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is different even from the great demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva. And because He is the creator of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.\xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction. One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the \nknowledge of the Supreme Lord. Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.One should not try to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a human being. As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being. This is again expressed here in a different way. A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.'
b'If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is known as the son of Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam: When He appeared before Devak\xe2\x80\x9d and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.Anything done under the direction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is transcendental. It cannot be contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious. The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is \nnothing auspicious in the material world. Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is inauspicious. We simply imagine it to be auspicious. Real auspiciousness depends on activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in full devotion and service. Therefore if we at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord. Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, or from a bona fide spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord. The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way. There is no contradiction in these three sources. All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world. The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa. Anyone acting under \nthe direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d and a yog\xe2\x80\x9d, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, or a pseudo-yog\xe2\x80\x9d.

TRANSLATION
Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear, \nfearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy are created by Me alone.
PURPORTThe different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and they are described here.Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter. Ordinary \nknowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge. Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter. In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs. Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.'
b'Asa\xe2\x80\xb9moha\xc5\xa1, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy. Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment. Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution. K\xc5\x92am\xe2\x88\x92, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of \nothers. Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit of others. Facts should not be misrepresented. According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is \npalatable to others. But that is not truthfulness. The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are. If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth. Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it. Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others. That is the definition of truth.Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal \nenjoyment. There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement. Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use. Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called \xe2\x80\x9cama\xc5\xa1, or calmness. Nor should one spend one\xc3\x95s time pondering over earning money. That is a misuse of the thinking power. The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented \nauthoritatively. The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed. Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Anything favorable for the development of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body. As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Birth and death apply to one\xc3\x95s embodiment in the material world. Fear is due to worrying about the future. A person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the '
b'spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead. Therefore his future is very bright. Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds. So they are therefore in constant anxiety. If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and be situated always in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. In that way we will be free from all fear. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material \nbody, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear. Their future is very bright. This fear is a condition of persons who are not in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.Ahi\xe2\x80\xb9s\xe2\x88\x92, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion. Material activities that are promised by so \nmany politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society. Ahi\xe2\x80\xb9s\xe2\x88\x92 means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of \nthe human body can be achieved. The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body. That which furthers the future \nspiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.Samat\xe2\x88\x92, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion. To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best. This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion. Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuting K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected. That is called samat\xe2\x88\x92, equanimity. A person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.Tu\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1i\xc5\xa1, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity. One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction. Tapas means austerity or penance. There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath. Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, '
b'but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance. Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month. One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles which are recommended. However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions. One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual \nadvancement. Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause. And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That is not only a good cause, but it is the best cause. Because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is good, His cause is also good. Thus charity should be \ngiven to a person who is engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic \ninjunction. But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge. A br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman. A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa. \nThus charity is offered to the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood. In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d. The sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes. The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance. Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in \nlife!awakening their K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness!it is the business of the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life. This knowledge and method is distributed by the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9ds; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.'
b'Ya\xe2\x80\x9ca\xc5\xa1, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee. That is real fame. If one has become a great man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous. One who does not have such fame is infamous.All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods. There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there. Now, for one who wants to advance in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa creates all these qualities, but the person develops \nthem himself from within. One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Nothing can manifest in this material world which is not in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

b'
PURPORTThe Lord is giving a genealogical synopsis of the universal population. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the original creature born out of the energy of the Supreme Lord known as Hira\xe2\x80\x9ayagarbha. And from Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 all the seven great sages, and before them four other great sages, named Sanaka, Sananda, San\xe2\x88\x92tana, and Sanatkum\xe2\x88\x92ra, and the Manus, are manifest. All these twenty-five great sages are known as the patriarchs of the living entities all over the universe. There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets within each universe, and \neach planet is full of population of different varieties. All of them are born of these twenty-five patriarchs. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa how to create. Then from Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, Sanaka, Sananda, San\xe2\x88\x92tana, and Sanatkum\xe2\x88\x92ra came out, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and k\xc5\x92atriyas are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is known as pit\xe2\x88\x92maha, the grandfather, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is known as the prapit\xe2\x88\x92-maha, the father of the grandfather. That is stated in the Eleventh Chapter of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. (Bg. 11.39)

TRANSLATION
He who knows in truth this glory and power of Mine engages in unalloyed devotional service; of this there is no doubt.
PURPORTThe highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Unless one is firmly convinced of the different opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service. Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great. Here are the details. If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord. When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him. This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and similar literatures.In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and the four great Kum\xe2\x88\x92ras and other patriarchs. There are many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the original forefather of all forefathers.\nThese are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord. When one is firmly convinced of them, he accepts K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service. All this particular knowledge is required in order to increase one\xc3\x95s interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.

I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and \nworship Me with all their hearts.
PURPORTA learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. He can never be \ndeviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools. All Vedic literature agrees that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the source of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva and all other demigods.

There was no Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, no \xe2\x80\xa1iva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun. There was only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, who creates all and enjoys all.\xc3\x93In the many Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas it is said that Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva was born from the highest, the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva, who is to be worshiped. In the Mok\xc5\x92a-dharma K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also says, praj\xe2\x88\x92pati\xe2\x80\xb9 ca rudra\xe2\x80\xb9 c\xe2\x88\x92py aham eva s\xe2\x80\x9ej\xe2\x88\x92mi vai tau hi m\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 na vij\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x80\x9dto mama m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92-vimohitau. \xc3\x92The patriarchs, \xe2\x80\xa1iva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy.\xc3\x93 In Var\xe2\x88\x92ha Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa it is also said, n\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc5\xa1 paro devas tasm\xe2\x88\x92j j\xe2\x88\x92ta\xe2\x80\x9c caturmukha\xc5\xa1 tasm\xe2\x88\x92d rudro \xc3\x95bhavad deva\xc5\xa1 sa ca sarvaj\xc5\x81at\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 gata\xc5\xa1. \xc3\x92N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 was born, from whom \xe2\x80\xa1iva was born.\xc3\x93\nLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything.

Everything is under Me; no one is above Me.\xc3\x93 There is no supreme controller other than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One who understands K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, becomes a truly learned man. In comparison to him, all others, who do not know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa properly, are but fools. \nOnly a fool would consider K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be an ordinary man. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and proceed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness with determination and firmness.'

TRANSLATION
The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Me.
PURPORTPure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects. The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically. Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord. Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental \npleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God. Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode. Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity. There are innumerable living entities '
b'traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service. This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering. The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material \nuniverse and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky. In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana, the supreme planet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and rests there. Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on. This plant of devotional service is fully described in the \nCaitanya-carit\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta. It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water. In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.The \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship \nbetween the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam is very dear to the devotees. In this narration there is nothing about material activities, sense gratification or liberation. \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord \nand His devotees is fully described. Thus the realized souls in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.

TRANSLATION
To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.
PURPORTIn this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant. We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga. Now buddhi-yoga is explained. Buddhi-yogam itself is action in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness; that is the highest intelligence. Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation. When one \ntries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam. In other words, \nbuddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world. The ultimate goal of progress is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important. One should know that the goal is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, \nhe is acting in karma-yoga. When he knows that the goal is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he is acting in j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga. And when he knows the goal and seeks K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa completely in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-'
b'yoga, which is the complete yoga. This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, then K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty. The qualification is that a person always engage himself in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services. He should perform some sort of work for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and that work should \nbe with love. If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization. If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.

Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.
PURPORTWhen Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma '
b'R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, thousands of people were following Him. Prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92nanda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist. Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists. Actually that is not the fact. There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he \nis helped by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself within his heart. So the sincere devotee engaged in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness cannot be without knowledge. The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge. For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic \nprinciples, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort. Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or the \nSupreme Truth. Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee. The pure devotee always has K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance. This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one\xc3\x95s heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, \nbut when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge. The ultimate goal of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument. The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving '
b'devotional service of the devotee. This is the essence of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s teachings. By studying Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, one can become a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service. As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-\npervading beauty. All the great sages such as N\xe2\x88\x92rada, Asita, Devala, and Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa \nproclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.
PURPORTIn these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul. Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as \nthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. He at once boldly declares, \xc3\x92You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\xc3\x93 And previously K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa states that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and \nevery human being is dependant on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the \nAbsolute Truth. Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.In the Kena Upani\xc5\x92ad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has already explained that everything is resting on Him. \nThe Mu\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8aka Upani\xc5\x92ad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him. This constant thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is smara\xe2\x80\x9aam, one of the methods of devotional service. It is only by devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.'
b'In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure. One who understands that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities. One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Arjuna\xc3\x95s acceptance of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature. This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom N\xe2\x88\x92rada is the chief.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one\xc3\x95s transcendental relationship with Him. He is the \nsupreme existence. He is free from bodily needs, birth and death. Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures. the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas and histories. In all Vedic literatures K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is thus described, and the Supreme \nLord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, \xc3\x92Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles.\xc3\x93 He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him. This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme \nLord.Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If we want to understand Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, we should accept the statements in these two verses. This is called the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system, acceptance of the disciplic succession. Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. It is not possible by so-called academic education. Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much \nevidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an ordinary person.

TRANSLATION
O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, I totally accept as truth all that You have told me. Neither the gods nor demons, O Lord, know Thy personality.
PURPORTArjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and that He is the perfect one. One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna. He received the authority of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 was lost, and therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and \na great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to G\xe2\x80\x9dtopani\xc5\x92ad, Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 should be understood in the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system. When the \nparampar\xe2\x88\x92 system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance of Arjuna of all that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, and then only can we understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, O origin of all, Lord of all beings, God of gods, O Supreme Person, Lord of the universe!
PURPORTThe Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be known by persons who are in a relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors. Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should not try to comment on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is the statement of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and since it is the science of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, it should be understood from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Arjuna understood it. It should not be received from atheistic persons.The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, \nlocalized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, yet they may not understand God\xc3\x95s personality from the verses of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, which are being spoken by this person, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Sometimes the impersonalists accept K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority. Yet many liberated persons cannot understand \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Puru\xc5\x92ottama, the Supreme Person, the father of all living entities. Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Puru\xc5\x92ottama. And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the controller of everyone. And even if one knows K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful \nGod of all demigods. And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all '
b'demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati. Thus the truth about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as He is.

PURPORTIn this verse it appears that Arjuna is already satisfied with his understanding of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. By K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s grace, Arjuna has personal experience, intelligence and knowledge and whatever else a person \nmay have through all these agencies, and he has understood K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For him there is no doubt, Yet he is asking K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to explain His all-pervading nature so that in the future people will understand, especially the impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies. One should know that this is being asked by Arjuna on behalf of the common people.'

How should I meditate on You? In what various forms are You to be contemplated, O Blessed Lord?
PURPORTAs it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. No common man, including the \ndemons and atheists, can know K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because He is guarded by His yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 energy. Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit. The \nsuperior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind. Out of his mercy, because he is a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned. He addresses K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa specifically as yogin because \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the master of the yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 energy by \nwhich He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa cannot always think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore he has to think materially. Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the '
b'materialistic persons of this world. Because materialists cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested by physical representations.

Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord.\xc3\x93 Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.'
b'Now as far as am\xe2\x80\x9etam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is just like nectar. And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience. Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead. For instance, the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord. In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.
PURPORTIt is not possible to comprehend the greatness of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and His opulences. The senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to '
b'understand the totality of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s affairs. Still the devotees try to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa fully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar. Thus they enjoy them. In discussing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations \nof His different energies. The word pr\xe2\x88\x92dh\xe2\x88\x92nyata\xc5\xa1 (principal) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. And as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In the Amara-ko\xe2\x80\x9ca dictionary it is stated that indicates an exceptional opulence.The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional \nopulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy. Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation. Now K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.

TRANSLATION
I am the Self, O Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca, seated in the hearts of all creatures. I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.
PURPORTIn this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gu\xc5\xb8\xe2\x88\x92ke\xe2\x80\x9ca, which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep. For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds. Thus this address by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to Arjuna is significant. Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion. Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Puru\xc5\x92a incarnations, \nand from Him everything begins. Therefore He is \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements. The total material energy is not the cause of the creation, but actually the Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vis\xe2\x80\x9au enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy. He is the soul. When Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au enters into the manifested \nuniverses, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity. We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark. Without the existence of the \nspiritual spark, the body cannot develop. Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa enters.The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes. A description of the three puru\xc5\x92a-avat\xe2\x88\x92ras is given in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. \xc3\x92The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features, as K\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vis\xe2\x80\x9au, Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au and K\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9drodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, in this material manifestation.\xc3\x93 The Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the cause of \nall causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au or K\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\x9aodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and therefore K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestation, and the end of all the energy.'

PURPORTThere are twelve \xe2\x80\xa2dityas, of which K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the principal. And among all the luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 the sun is accepted as the glowing effulgence of the Supreme Lord and is considered to be one of His eyes. Mar\xe2\x80\x9dci is the controlling deity of the heavenly spaces. Among the stars, the moon is most prominent at night, and \nthus the moon represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
Of the great sages I am Bh\xe2\x80\x9egu; of vibrations I am the transcendental om. Of sacrifices I am the chanting of the holy names [japa], and of immovable things I am the Himalayas.
PURPORTBrahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first living creature within the universe, created several sons for the propagation of various kinds of species. The most powerful of his sons is Bh\xe2\x80\x9egu, who is also the greatest sage. Of all the transcendental vibrations, the \xc3\x92om\xc3\x93 (omkara) represents the Supreme. Of all the sacrifices, the chanting of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare is the purest representation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Sometimes animal sacrifices are recommended, but in the sacrifice of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, there is no question of violence. It is the simplest and the purest. Whatever is sublime in the worlds is a representation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore the \nHimalayas, the greatest mountains in the world, also represent Him. The mountain named Meru was mentioned in a previous verse, but Meru is sometimes movable, whereas the Himalayas are never movable. Thus the Himalayas are greater than Meru.'

TRANSLATION
Of all trees I am the holy fig tree, and amongst sages and demigods I am N\xe2\x88\x92rada. Of the singers of the gods [Gandharvas] I am Citraratha, and among perfected beings I am the sage Kapila.
PURPORTThe fig tree (a\xe2\x80\x9cvattha) is one of the most beautiful and highest trees, and people in India often worship it as one of their daily morning rituals. Amongst the demigods they also worship N\xe2\x88\x92rada, who is considered the greatest devotee in the universe. Thus he is the representation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a devotee. The Gandharva planet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and among them the best singer is Citraratha. Amongst the perpetually living entities, Kapila is considered an incarnation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and His philosophy is mentioned in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. Later on another Kapila became famous, but his philosophy was atheistic. Thus there is a gulf of difference between them.

TRANSLATION
Of horses know Me to be Uccai\xc5\xa1\xe2\x80\x9crav\xe2\x88\x92, who rose out of the ocean, born of the elixir of immortality; of lordly elephants I am Air\xe2\x88\x92vata, and among men I am \nthe monarch.
PURPORTThe devotee demigods and the demons (asuras) once took a sea journey. On this journey, nectar and poison were produced, and Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva drank the poison. From the nectar were produced many entities, of which there was a horse named Uccai\xc5\xa1\xe2\x80\x9crav\xe2\x88\x92. Another animal produced from the nectar was an elephant named Air\xe2\x88\x92vata. Because these two animals were produced from \nnectar, they have special significance, and they are representatives of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.Amongst the human beings, the king is the representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the maintainer of the universe, and the kings, who are appointed on account of their godly qualifications, are maintainers of their kingdoms. Kings like Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Yudhi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1hira, Mah\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ja Par\xe2\x80\x9dk\xc5\x92it and Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma were all highly righteous kings who always thought of the citizens\xc3\x95 welfare. In Vedic literature, the king is considered to be the representative of God. In this age, however, \nwith the corruption of the principles of religion, monarchy decayed and is now finally abolished. It is to be understood that in the past, however, people were more happy under righteous kings.'

TRANSLATION
Of weapons I am the thunderbolt; among cows I am the surabhi, givers of abundant milk. Of procreators I am Kandarpa, the god of love, and of serpents I am V\xe2\x88\x92suki, the chief.
PURPORTThe thunderbolt, indeed a mighty weapon, represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s power. In K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka in the spiritual sky there are cows which can be milked at any time, and they give as much milk as one likes. Of course such cows do not exist in this material world, but there is mention of them in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka. The Lord keeps many such cows, which are called surabhi. It is stated that the Lord is engaged in herding the surabhi cows. Kandarpa is the sex desire for presenting good sons; therefore Kandarpa is the representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Sometimes sex is engaged in only for sense gratification; such sex does not represent K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But sex for the generation of good children is called Kandarpa and represents \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'

Of the celestial N\xe2\x88\x92ga snakes I am Ananta; of the aquatic deities I am Varu\xe2\x80\x9aa. Of departed ancestors I am Aryam\xe2\x88\x92, and among the dispensers of law I am Yama, lord of death.
PURPORTAmong the many celestial Naga serpents, Ananta is the greatest, as is Varu\xe2\x80\x9aa among the aquatics. They both represent K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. There is also a planet of trees presided over by Aryam\xe2\x88\x92, who represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. There are many living entities who give punishment to the miscreants, and among them Yama is the chief. Yama is situated in a planet near this earthly planet, and after death those who are very sinful are taken there, and Yama arranges different kinds of punishments for them.

TRANSLATION
Among the Daitya demons I am the devoted Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da; among subduers I am time; among the beasts I am the lion, and among birds I am Garu\xc5\xb8a, the \nfeathered carrier of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au.
PURPORTDiti and Aditi are two sisters. The sons of Aditi are called \xe2\x80\xa2dityas, and the sons of Diti are called Daityas. All the \xe2\x80\xa2dityas are devotees of the Lord, and all the Daityas are atheistic. Although Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da was born in the family of the Daityas, he was a great devotee from his childhood. Because of his devotional service and godly nature, he is considered to be a representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.\nThere are many subduing principles, but time wears down all things in the material universe and so represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Of the many animals, the lion is the most powerful and ferocious, and of the million varieties of birds, Garu\xc5\xb8a, the bearer of Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, is the greatest.

Of purifiers I am the wind; of the wielders of weapons I am R\xe2\x88\x92ma; of fishes I am the shark, and of flowing rivers I am the Ganges.
PURPORTOf all the aquatics the shark is one of the biggest and is certainly the most dangerous to man. Thus the shark represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

Of all creations I am the beginning and the end and also the middle, O Arjuna. Of all sciences I am the spiritual science of the Self, and among logicians I am the conclusive truth.
PURPORTAmong created manifestations, the total material elements are first created by Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au and are annihilated by Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the secondary creator. All these created elements are different incarnations of the material qualities of the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creation.Regarding the spiritual science of the Self, there are many literatures, such as \nthe four Vedas, the  and the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas, the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam and the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. These are all representatives of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Among logicians there are different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called japa. The attempt to defeat one another is called vita\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8a, and the final conclusion is \ncalled v\xe2\x88\x92da.

TRANSLATION
Of letters I am the letter A, and among compounds I am the dual word. I am also inexhaustable time, and of creators I am Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, whose manifold faces turn everywhere.
PURPORTAk\xe2\x88\x92ra, the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is the beginning of the Vedic literature. Without ak\xe2\x88\x92ra, nothing can be sounded; therefore it is the beginning of sound. In Sanskrit there are also many compound words, of which the dual word, like R\xe2\x88\x92ma-k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is called dvandva\xc5\xa1. For instance, R\xe2\x88\x92ma and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa have the same rhythm and therefore are called dual.Among all kinds of killers, time is the ultimate because time kills everything. \nTime is the representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because in due course of time there will be a great fire and everything will be annihilated.Among the creators and living entities, Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the chief. The various Brahm\xe2\x88\x92s exhibit four, eight, sixteen, etc., heads accordingly, and they are the chief creators in their respective universes.

I am all-devouring death, and I am the generator of all things yet to be. Among women I am fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, faithfulness and patience.
PURPORTAs soon as a man is born, he dies at every moment. Thus death is devouring every living entity at every moment, but the last stroke is called death itself. That death is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. All species of life undergo six basic changes. They are born, they grow, they remain for some time, they reproduce, they dwindle and finally vanish. Of these changes, the first is deliverance from the womb, and that is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The first generation is the beginning of all future activities.\nThe six opulences listed are considered to be feminine. If a woman possesses all of them or some of them she becomes glorious. Sanskrit is a perfect language and is therefore very glorious. After studying, if one can remember the subject matter, he is gifted with good memory, or sm\xe2\x80\x9eti One need not read many books on different subject matters; the ability to remember a few and quote them when necessary is also another opulence.

TRANSLATION
Of hymns I am the B\xe2\x80\x9ehat-s\xe2\x88\x92ma sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d verse, sung daily by br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. Of months I am November and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.
PURPORTIt has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the S\xe2\x88\x92ma-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.One of these songs is the B\xe2\x80\x9ehat-s\xe2\x88\x92ma, which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry. Amongst the regulated \npoetry, the G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, is the most prominent. The G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d mantra is mentioned in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. Because the G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord. This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord. One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness \naccording to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d mantra. The G\xe2\x88\x92yatr\xe2\x80\x9d mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered \nto be the sound incarnation of Brahman. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy. Of course spring is a season universally liked \nbecause it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish. In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

I am also the gambling of cheats, and of the splendid I am the splendor. I am victory, I am adventure, and I am the strength of the strong.
PURPORTThere are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe. Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As the Supreme, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be more deceitful than any mere man. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit. His greatness is not simply one-sided\xc3\x91it is all-sided.Among the victorious, He is victory. He is the splendor of the splendid. Among enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising. Among adventurers, He is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the \nstrongest. When K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength. Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill. No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength.

TRANSLATION
Of the descendants of V\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai I am V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva, and of the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas I am Arjuna. Of the sages I am Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, and among great thinkers I am U\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x88\x92.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva is the immediate expansion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Both Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Baladeva appear as the sons of Vasudeva. Amongst the sons of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, Arjuna is famous and valiant. Indeed, he is the best of men and therefore represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa is the greatest \nbecause he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of Kali. And Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa is also known as an incarnation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa also represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter. Among the kavis, U\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x88\x92 was the spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing, political and spiritual in every way. Thus U\xe2\x80\x9can\xe2\x88\x92 is another representative of the opulence of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'

Among punishments I am the rod of chastisement, and of those who seek victory, I am morality. Of secret things I am silence, and of the wise I am wisdom.
PURPORTThere are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that cut down the miscreants. When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement represents K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality. Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly. The wise \nman is he who can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God\xc3\x95s superior and inferior natures. Such knowledge is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself.

TRANSLATION
But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.
PURPORTThe Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul. The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate \nopulence and grandeur. He should know that all things are existing due to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s entering them as Supersoul. From Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord. He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him. He is \nsamat\xe2\x88\x92, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal '
b'to Him. In the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in the same category with demigods!be they even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 or \xe2\x80\xa1iva!becomes at once an atheist. If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and can fix his mind in the worship of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without deviation. The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is. Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their \nminds in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position. Devotional service and worship of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven. That is the way of pure devotional service. How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Tenth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Opulence of the Absolute.'

Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.
PURPORTThis chapter reveals K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the cause of all causes. He is even the cause of the Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and from Him the material universes emanate. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations. That has been completely explained in the last chapter.Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over. This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything. Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but now he is thinking that although he may accept K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the source of everything, others may not. So in order \nto establish K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s divinity for all, he is requesting K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in this chapter to show His universal form. Actually when one sees the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form. Arjuna agrees to what K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says several times. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s grace. He is now convinced that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone\xc3\x95s \nheart as the Supersoul.

TRANSLATION
O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.
PURPORTArjuna addresses Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as \xc3\x92lotus-eyed\xc3\x93 (K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself. He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail. Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them. His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading. That is the inconceivable opulence of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa which Arjuna \nadmits that he has thoroughly understood.

TRANSLATION
O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation. I want to see that form of Yours.
PURPORTThe Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on. Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart \nfrom it. Arjuna\xc3\x95s asking the Lord\xc3\x95s permission is also significant. Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others. He did not have any personal desire for confirmation. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa also \nunderstands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God. The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.

TRANSLATION
If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.
PURPORTIt is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, by the material senses. But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord. Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s inestimable position. Arjuna could \nunderstand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The word yoge\xe2\x80\x9cvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is \nunlimited. Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He does not give K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa orders. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, behold now My opulences, hundreds of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea.
PURPORTArjuna wanted to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His universal form, which, although a transcendental form, is just manifested for the cosmic manifestation and is therefore subject to the temporary time of this material nature. As the material nature is manifested and not manifested, similarly this universal form \nof K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested and unmanifested. It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s other forms. As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in this way, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa reveals this form. This universal form is not possible to be seen by any ordinary man. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa must give one the power to see it.

PURPORTEven though Arjuna was a personal friend of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the most advanced of learned men, it was still not possible for him to know everything about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

Whatever you wish to see can be seen all at once in this body. This universal form can show you all that you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in the future. Everything is here completely.

But you cannot see Me with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine eyes by which you can behold My mystic opulence.
PURPORTA pure devotee does not like to see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes. To see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Arjuna is told '
b'not to change his mind but his vision. The universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not very important; that will be clear in the verses. Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences. The playmates of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the friends of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the parents of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa never want K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to show His opulences. They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In their loving exchange they forget that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Lord. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that the boys who play with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Such boys do not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They take Him as a personal friend. The Supreme Person is \nconsidered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men. The fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s statement so that in the future people could understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna. Arjuna must confirm this \nbecause Arjuna is the beginning of the parampar\xe2\x88\x92 system. Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already \nexplained.

Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was all wondrous. The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in many garbs. He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many \nscents smeared over His body. All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. \nThis was seen by Arjuna.
PURPORTThese two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs, etc., of the Lord. These manifestations are distributed throughout the universe and are unlimited. By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see them while sitting in one place. That is due to the inconceivable potency of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.
PURPORTWhat Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Sa\xc5\x81jaya is trying to give a mental picture of that great revelation to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra. Neither Sa\xc5\x81jaya nor Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra were present, but Sa\xc5\x81jaya, by the grace of Vy\xe2\x88\x92sa, could see whatever happened. Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).

TRANSLATION
At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.
PURPORTThe word tatra (there) is very significant. It indicates that both Arjuna and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form. Others '
b'on the battlefield could not see this form because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gave the vision only to Arjuna. Arjuna could see in the body of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa many thousands of universes. As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets. Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc. Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these universes. But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.
PURPORTOnce the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna changes immediately. Before, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is praising the universal form. Thus Arjuna\xc3\x95s relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship. Great devotees see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the reservoir of all '
b'relationships. In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands. He was not, of course, afraid. He was \naffected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord. The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.

PURPORTArjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au lies in the lower regions of the universe.

TRANSLATION
You are the origin without beginning, middle or end. You have numberless arms, and the sun and moon are among Your great unlimited eyes. By Your own \nradiance You are heating this entire universe.
PURPORTThere is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here and in many other places there is repetition, but according to the scriptures, repetition of the glories of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not a literary weakness. It is said that at a time of bewilderment or wonder or of great ecstasy, statements are repeated over and over. That is not a flaw.

PURPORTDy\xe2\x88\x92v \xe2\x88\x92p\xe2\x80\x9ethivyo\xc5\xa1 (the space between heaven and earth) and lokatrayam (three worlds) are significant words in this verse because it appears that not only Arjuna saw this universal form of the Lord, but others in other planetary systems also saw it. The vision was not a dream. All who were spiritually awake with the divine vision saw it.

PURPORTIn a previous verse the Lord promised to show Arjuna things he would by very interested in seeing. Now Arjuna sees that the leaders of the opposite party (Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa and all the sons of Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra) and their soldiers and Arjuna\xc3\x95s own soldiers are all being annihilated. This is an indication that Arjuna will emerge victorious in battle, despite heavy losses on both sides. It is also mentioned here that Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma, who is supposed to be unconquerable, will also be smashed. So also Kar\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you [the P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas], all the soldiers \nhere on both sides will be slain.
PURPORTAlthough Arjuna knew that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force. It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92. Yasya brahme ca k\xc5\x92atram ca ubhe bhavata odana\xc5\xa1/m\xe2\x80\x9etyur yasyopasecana\xe2\x80\xb9 ka itth\xe2\x88\x92 veda yatra sa\xc5\xa1. Eventually all the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, k\xc5\x92atriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme. This \nform of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time. Except for a few P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8avas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him.Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration. In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan. If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way. Death cannot be checked, \neven if he did not fight. In fact, they were already dead. Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord. That is the law of nature.

TRANSLATION
Therefore get up and prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyas\xe2\x88\x92cin, can be but an instmment in the fight.
PURPORTSavyas\xe2\x88\x92cin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies. \xc3\x92Just become an instrument\xc3\x93: nimitta-m\xe2\x88\x92tram. This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the \nSupreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \xc3\x92perhaps\xc3\x93 and \xc3\x92maybe.\xc3\x93 There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long they have \nthe domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra was fought according to the plan of God. Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one '
b'is in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is perfect.

O H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You \ntheir respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All \nthis is rightly done.
PURPORTArjuna, after hearing from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord. He admitted that everything done by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is quite fit. Arjuna confirmed that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables. His actions are equally good for all. Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher \nplanets, and they were observing the fight because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa was present there. When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.'

TRANSLATION
O great one, who stands above even Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, You are the original master. Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the \nuniverse, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.
PURPORTBy this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is worshipable by everyone. He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul. Arjuna is addressing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as mah\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited. Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the \ninfluence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and deve\xe2\x80\x9ca means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all. He is the center of the whole universe. Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him because no one is greater than Him. He especially mentions that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is greater than Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 because Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is created by Him. Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, who '
b'is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s plenary expansion; therefore Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva, who is born of Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. Thus the Lord is respected by Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva and Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and similar other demigods. The word ak\xc5\x92aram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme.

TRANSLATION
You are the original Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You know everything, and You are all that is \nknowable. You are above the material modes. O limitless form! This whole \ncosmic manifestation is pervaded by You!
PURPORTEverything is resting on the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is the ultimate rest. Nidh\xe2\x88\x92nam means that everything, even the Brahman effulgence, rests on the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is the '
b'knower of everything that is happening in this world, and if knowledge has any end, He is the end of all knowledge; therefore He is the known and the knowable. He is the object of knowledge because He is all-pervading. Because He is the cause in the spiritual world, He is transcendental. He is also the chief personality in the transcendental world.

PURPORTThe Lord is addressed here as air because the air is the most important representation of all the demigods, being all-pervasive.

I have in the past addressed You as \xc3\x92O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O Y\xe2\x88\x92dava,\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92O my friend,\xc3\x93 without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored You many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes alone and sometimes in \nfront of many friends. Please excuse me for all my offenses.
PURPORTAlthough K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise '
b'out of friendship. He is admitting that formerly he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend. Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as \xc3\x92O my friend, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, O Y\xe2\x88\x92dava,\xc3\x93 etc., without acknowledging His opulence. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend. Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord. The relationship between the living entity and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, \nas we can see from the behavior of Arjuna. Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

You are the father of this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master. No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You. Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.'

PURPORTThe Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son. He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Without being a representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.\nThe Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects. He is of immeasurable greatness. No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, because no one is equal to or higher than K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa within any manifestation, spiritual or material. Everyone is below Him. No one can excel Him.The Supreme Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself. \nFoolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme. It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours. He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited. No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after \nquitting his body, returns to Him and doesn\xc3\x95t come back again to this miserable world. Therefore one should know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s activities are different from others. The best policy is to follow the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; that will make one perfect. It is also stated that there is no one who is master of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; everyone is His servant. Only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is God, and everyone is servant. Everyone is complying with His order. There is no one who can deny His order. Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His \nsuperintendence. As stated in the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, He is the cause of all causes.'

TRANSLATION
After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.
PURPORTArjuna is always in confidence with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend\xc3\x95s opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form. But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa out of his unalloyed friendship. Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear. Arjuna therefore is asking K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to show His N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa form because He can assume any form. This universal form is \nmaterial and temporary, as the material world is temporary. But in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa. There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is present by His plenary manifestations of different names. Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planets. Of course in each Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1ha planet the form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc. \nAccording to the different hands these four things are held in, the N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aas '
b'are named. All of these forms are one and the same to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.

TRANSLATION
O universal Lord, I wish to see You in Your four-armed form, with helmeted head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see You in that form.
PURPORTIn the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that the Lord is eternally situated in hundreds and thousands of forms, and the main forms are those like R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9ha, N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, etc. There are innumerable forms. But Arjuna knew that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Personality of Godhead assuming His temporary universal form. He is now asking to see the form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, a spiritual form. This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features \noriginate from Him. He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is \nGod in any of His innumerable forms. In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man. That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of '
b'Godhead. One who knows K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material world by My internal potency. No one before you has \never seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.
PURPORTArjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence. This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces \nwere rapidly changing. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna. This form was manifested by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to '
b'Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa manifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown \nto Arjuna. It is clearly said that no one has ever seen this form before.

TRANSLATION
O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, \nnor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only you have seen this.'
b'
PURPORTThe divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood. Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly. Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision. And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au are demigods. Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or who only recognize the impersonal part of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decry K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and at the same time have the \ndivine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine. In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna. Now one can have some idea of the after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord. But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine \nnature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord. As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yaj\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92dhya-yanai\xc5\xa1, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial \nregulations. Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas (\xe2\x80\xa0k, Yajus, S\xe2\x88\x92ma and Atharva) and the eighteen Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas and Upani\xc5\x92ads, and One can study these at home or anywhere else. Similarly, there are and for studying the method of sacrifice. D\xe2\x88\x92nai\xc5\xa1 refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party. such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aavas. Similarly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes. Pious activities and the \nvoluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya. So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that \nuniversal form. Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we understand '
b'that the impersonalists are not devotees. Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.There are many persons who create incarnations. They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness. We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge. Although Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what. The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that \nthey have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one cannot see the universal form of God. So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen. A devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.

PURPORTIn the beginning of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 Arjuna was worried about killing Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa, his worshipful grandfathers and masters. But K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When they tried to disrobe Draupad\xe2\x80\x9d in the assembly, Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always \npeaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. A devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Sa\xc5\x81jaya said to Dh\xe2\x80\x9etar\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, while speaking thus to Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He showed him His two-armed form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna.
PURPORTWhen K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, He first of all appeared as four-armed N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance. Similarly, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nknew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The word saumya-vapu\xc5\xa1 is very significant. Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as \nthe most beautiful form. When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s form, and because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful \nform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. In the Brahma-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

When Arjuna thus saw K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.
PURPORTHere the words  clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed. Those who deride K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that one who thinks that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is an ordinary \nperson and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa speaking, is doing the greatest injustice. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has actually shown His universal form and His fourhanded Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form. So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 because he knows what is what. The original verses of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to \nsee this form which is so dear.
PURPORTIn the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc. Now here the word sudurdar\xe2\x80\x9cam is used, indicating that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s two-handed form is still more confidential. One may be able to see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc. It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal \nform, the form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva. They desire to see Him, and we have \nevidences in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devak\xe2\x80\x9d, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. They even waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1iva in His two-armed form.In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s body, as confirmed by Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 and '
b'confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality. His body is never like a material body. But for some who make a study of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by reading Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 or similar Vedic scriptures, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is a problem. For one using a material process, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher. But He isn\xc3\x95t an ordinary man. But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body. Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal \nfeature attached to material nature. This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord. Another calculation is speculative. Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme. Thus some think that the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form. According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary. They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a \nperson. But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, Chapter Two: to hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from authorities. That is the actual Vedic process, \nand those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa becomes dear. As we have several times discussed, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is covered by His yoga-m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92 potency. He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone. Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen. This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a \nsurrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood. The transcendentalist, by continuous K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and by devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by revelation. Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His two-handed form. The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is very, very \ndifficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara.

TRANSLATION
The form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, \nnor by charity, nor by worship. It is not by these means that one can see Me as I am.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa first appeared before His parents Devak\xe2\x80\x9d and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form. This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service. For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic interest, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not easy to understand. Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship. They make their visit, but they cannot understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as He is. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself in the next verse.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service. He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or how He \ncame from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. As far as charity is \nconcerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa philosophy or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness throughout the world. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a the most munificent man of charity because love of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, '
b'usually of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa), that is a chance to progress. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation. For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be \nused, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.The personal forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna. The four-handed form is N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, and the two-handed form is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary. The very word sudurdar\xe2\x80\x9cam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form. It also suggests that amongst the devotees \nthere was no necessity of showing it. That form was exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa and then to His own natural form of two hands. This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is the origin of all \nemanations. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception. As far as the four-handed forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa (which is known as Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord. Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge. He is the source of all forms of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92.In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person. His name is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He sometimes descends on this earth. Similarly, in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam there is a description of all kinds of '
b'incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas tu bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n svayam. Similarly, in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Lord says, matta\xc5\xa1 parataram n\xe2\x88\x92ny\xe2\x88\x92t: \xc3\x92There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.\xc3\x93 He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, aham \xe2\x88\x92dir hi dev\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m: \xc3\x92I am the origin of all the demigods.\xc3\x93 And after understanding Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: para\xe2\x80\xb9 brahma para\xe2\x80\xb9 dh\xe2\x88\x92ma pavitra\xe2\x80\xb9 parama\xe2\x80\xb9 bhav\xe2\x88\x92n: \xc3\x92I \nnow fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything.\xc3\x93 Therefore the universal form which K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God. The original is the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa form. The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God. It is not God\xc3\x95s original form.The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with \nthe Lord in different transcendental relationships. The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful. Arjuna, who is a constant companion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man. Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form. This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating \nthemselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the most dear.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is \nfriendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.
PURPORTAnyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, must take this formula, as is \nstated by the Supreme Himself. Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life. The Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead. Now here is the verse \nwhich clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service. As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious activities. No work should be done by any man except in relationship to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to \nthe result of his work, but the result should be done for Him. For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, one has to do business for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the proprietor of '
b'the business, then K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa should enjoy the profit of the business. If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he can do it. This is work for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and he can install the Deity of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and arrange for the Deity\xc3\x95s service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service. This is all K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One should also accept as pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, food, the remnants of offerings to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; that is also K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-karma. One can cultivate a garden. Anyone who has land\xc3\x91in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land\xc3\x91can utilize that for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by growing flowers to offer Him. He can sow tulas\xe2\x80\x9d plants because tulas\xe2\x80\x9d leaves are very important, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has recommended this in \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a \nlittle water\xc3\x91and He is satisfied. This leaf especially refers to the tulas\xe2\x80\x9d So one can sow tulas\xe2\x80\x9d leaves and pour water on the plant. Thus, even the poorest man \ncan engage in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.The word mat-parama\xc5\xa1 refers to one who considers the association of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life. Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly \nplanets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka. He has no attraction for that. He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky. And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other. As indicated by the word mad-bhakta\xc5\xa1, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the \nnine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him. One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.The term sa\xef\xac\x81ga-varjita\xc5\xa1 is very significant. One should disassociate himself from persons who are against K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Not only are the atheistic persons against '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-ras\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9eta-sindhu as follows: Gosv\xe2\x88\x92m\xe2\x80\x9d clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination. He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation. When, freed from such unwanted association and \nfrom the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, that is called pure devotional service. . One should think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and act for \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa favorably, not unfavorably. Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa was an enemy of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s. From the very beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious \nin every respect, but that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at last killed him. Of course anyone who is killed by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee. The pure devotee does not even want salvation. He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. His only objective is to serve K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa wherever he may be.\nA devotee of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is friendly to everyone. Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy. How is this? A devotee situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness knows that only devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa can relieve a person from all the problems of life. He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, into human society. There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness. The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ. He \nwas crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness. Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed. Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as \xe2\x80\x93h\xe2\x88\x92kur Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa. Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and it is difficult. A K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one\xc3\x95s '
b'neighbor from all material problems. In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord. Now, we can imagine how merciful K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him. Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.In summary, the universal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, four-handed, have all been exhibited by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Thus K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the origin of all these manifestations. It is not that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is a manifestation of the original \nor Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the origin of all forms. There are hundreds and thousands of Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aus, but for a devotee, no form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is important but the original form, two-handed \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara. In the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated that those who are attached to the \xe2\x80\xa1y\xe2\x88\x92masundara form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else. One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is essential and supreme.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Eleventh Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Universal Form.'

Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?
PURPORTK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yog\xe2\x80\x9ds. Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes. One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist. The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord. The impersonalist engages himself not directly in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa but in meditation on the \nimpersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest. If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists. Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal \nBrahman are called impersonalists. Arjuna is here questioning which position is better. There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is highest of all. It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth. In the \nSeventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole. In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s abode. And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, he who thinks of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa within himself is considered to be the most perfect. So \nthroughout the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 personal devotion to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is recommended as the \nhighest form of spiritual realization. Yet there are those who are still attracted '
b'to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses. Arjuna would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge. In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman. He wants to know whether his position is secure. The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for \nmeditation. Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore Arjuna wants to say, \xc3\x92What is the use of such a waste of time?\xc3\x93 Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This important question asked of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the \nAbsolute Truth.

It is inferred that one has to approach Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, otherwise there is no perfect realization. Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders unto Him.In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc. Then one comes to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere. Realizing this, \none envies no living entity!he sees no difference between man and animal because he sees soul only, not the outer covering. But for the common man, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult.'

TRANSLATION
For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progrese in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.
PURPORTThe group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, and persons who are in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yog\xe2\x80\x9ds. Now, here the difference between j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed. The process of j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult \nfor him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, the bhakti-yog\xe2\x80\x9d accepts the Deity of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may '
b'be sagu\xe2\x80\x9aa and nirgu\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is sagu\xe2\x80\x9aa worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.A crude example may be given here. We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty. But any old box, or an imitation, which we may \nfind somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work. Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha. This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord. God will accept service through that form. The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man \nin conditioned life.\nSo, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult. They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upani\xc5\x92ads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes. This is not very easy for a common man. A person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, engaged in \ndevotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end. But the personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme \nPersonality directly. A similar passage appears in \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam. It is stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not \nBrahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome. Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this '
b'troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized. By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service. At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a \nsource of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea. Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization. Every living soul is partially independant, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self. One should not take up this process. For every individual living entity the process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way. If one wants to ignore \nthis devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism. Thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age. It is not advised by Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, for him \nI am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.
PURPORTIt is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord. In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him. His duty is to render service to the Lord\xc3\x91if not, then he will render service to m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92.\nAs stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional service. Therefore, one should be fully devoted. One should fix his mind fully on K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in order to achieve Him. One should work only for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is the standard of devotional service. The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His life\xc3\x95s mission is to please K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and he can sacrifice everything \nfor K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruk\xc5\x92etra. The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at '
b'the same time in chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence. Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord \nHimself takes him. He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.In the Var\xe2\x88\x92ha Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa this verse appears:nay\xe2\x88\x92mi parama\xe2\x80\xb9 sth\xe2\x88\x92nam arcir\xe2\x88\x92di-gati\xe2\x80\xb9 vin\xe2\x88\x92garu\xc5\xb8a-skandham \xe2\x88\x92ropya yatheccham aniv\xe2\x88\x92rita\xc5\xa1The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice a\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81ga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets. The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself. He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer. A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure. Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets. Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garu\xc5\xb8a, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence. \nAlthough a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself. But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued. Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence. One simply has to practice the easy process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service. Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths. In the N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x80\x9dya this is confirmed as follows:y\xe2\x88\x92 vai s\xe2\x88\x92dhana-sampatti-puru\xc5\x92\xe2\x88\x92rtha-catu\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ayetay\xe2\x88\x92 vin\xe2\x88\x92 tad-\xe2\x88\x92pnoti naro n\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9craya\xc5\xa1The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process. One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the '
b'benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc. That is the specific benediction of devotional service.Simply by chanting the holy name of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare\xc3\x91a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.The conclusion of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:sarva-dharm\xe2\x88\x92n parityajya m\xe2\x88\x92m eka\xe2\x80\xb9 \xe2\x80\x9cara\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 vrajaaha\xe2\x80\xb9 tv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 sarva-p\xe2\x88\x92pebhyo mok\xc5\x92ayi\xc5\x92y\xe2\x88\x92mi m\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x80\x9cuca\xc5\xa1.One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life. There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him. Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization. \nLet everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That is the highest perfection of life.

b'
PURPORTOne who is engaged in Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s devotional service lives in a direct relationship with the Supreme Lord, so there is no doubt that his position is transcendental from the very beginning. A devotee does not live on the material plane\xc3\x91he lives in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee. When he offers K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa food, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa-ized by eating the remnants. One who does not engage in such service cannot understand how this is so, although this is a process recommended in the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and in other Vedic literatures.

TRANSLATION
My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga In this \nway you will develop a desire to attain to Me.
PURPORTIn this verse, two different processes of bhakti-yoga are indicated. The first applies to one who has actually developed an attachment for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the '
b'Supreme Personality of Godhead, by transcendental love. And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love. For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses. At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification. But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become \npurified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord. In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don\xc3\x95t really lovingly serve my master. I simply serve to get some money. And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me. So there is no question of love. But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love. That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.\nThis love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone\xc3\x95s heart. And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material association. Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant, natural love for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa has to be revived. That is the whole process.To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and \nchant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, and so on. There are various rules and regulations which one should follow. And one should constantly hear Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam from pure devotees. This practice can help anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God. This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.

TRANSLATION
If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.
PURPORTOne who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord. How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor \nrequires land, capital, organization, and labor. Just as, in business, one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are \nvarious fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. This voluntary service to the cause of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.'

TRANSLATION
If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.
PURPORTIt may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments. If one attaches himself directly to the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he \nsacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the result of one\xc3\x95s previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of \nhis activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one\xc3\x95s activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa '
b'consciousness. Of course K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is not dependant on any other experience because K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness itself can purify one\xc3\x95s mind, but if there are impediments to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one may try to give up the result of his action. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one\xc3\x95s country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we find it is stated: If one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme \ncause is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he will come gradually to understand that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method.

TRANSLATION
If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one \ncan attain peace of mind.'
b'
PURPORTAs mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position. Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation. By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a \ngradual process. There are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service. If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, vai\xe2\x80\x9cyas, and which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause. In summary, to \nreach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct. Devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one\xc3\x95s activities. Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One may either take the step by step process or the \ndirect path. The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good. It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord. It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed. But as far as Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed. Everyone is \nadvised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'

TRANSLATION
One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in \nhappiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service \nwith determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me\xc3\x91he is very dear to Me.'
b'
PURPORTComing again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses. A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances. Nor is he envious of anyone. Nor does a devotee become his enemy\xc3\x95s enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds. Thus it is better to suffer than to protest. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated: tat te \xc3\x95nukamp\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 su-sam\xe2\x80\x9dk\xc5\x92yama\xe2\x80\x9ao. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, \nhe thinks that it is the Lord\xc3\x95s mercy upon him. He thinks: \xc3\x92Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\xc3\x93 Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to \nthe peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual \nmaster, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined. He is not swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All his qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the \nLord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.'

TRANSLATION
He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety, who is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me.
PURPORTA few of a devotee\xc3\x95s qualifications are further being described. No one is put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee. Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into \nanxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all such material circumstances cannot woo him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn\xc3\x95t, he is sorry and envious. When he is \nexpecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. But a devotee is '
b'always transcendental to all these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
A devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for \nsome result, is very dear to Me.
PURPORTMoney may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not ag\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92ted. Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early \nin the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of all activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of \ndevotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great '
b'energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations.

If he loses anything which is very dear to him, he does not lament. Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed. He is \ntranscendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful activities. He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Nothing is an impediment in the discharge of his devotional service. Such a devotee is very dear to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.'

TRANSLATION
One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equiposed in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contamination, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn\xc3\x95t care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and engaged in devotional \nservice, is very dear to Me.
PURPORTA devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a '
b'devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the Supreme Lord. He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may \nsometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. One who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course \nhe does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them.

He who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engages himself with faith, making Me the supreme goal, is very, very dear to Me.
PURPORTIn this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given. This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in such a process. The question who is better\xc3\x91one who is engaged in the path \nof impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead\xc3\x91was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied \nto him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path \nis recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute \nTruth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, is more congenial. '
b'One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Twelfth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Devotional Service.'

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said: O my dear K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, I wish to know about prak\xe2\x80\x9eti [nature], Puru\xc5\x92a [the enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the end of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, \nis called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the \nfield.
PURPORTArjuna was inquisitive about prak\xe2\x80\x9eti or nature, puru\xc5\x92a, the enjoyer, k\xc5\x92etra, the field, k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge. When he inquired about all these, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field \nof activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is called k\xc5\x92etra, or the field of activity for '
b'the conditioned soul. Now, the person who does not identify himself with the body is called k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning\xc3\x91dehe \xc3\x95smin\xc3\x91that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctly k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a. Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a woman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers. The knower is different from the field. Although we use many articles\xc3\x91our clothes, etc.\xc3\x91we know- that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also \nunderstand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body.In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the knower of the body, the living entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described. In the middle six chapters of the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described. The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the \nindividual soul are definitely defined in these chapters. The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering. When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities!as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge. That is also described. Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord \nthrough the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained. Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related. This also is explained.'

TRANSLATION
O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is My opinion.
PURPORTWhile discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the 1iving entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa says, \xc3\x92I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, or Supersoul.\xc3\x93\nOne who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, can attain to knowledge.The Lord says: \xc3\x92I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.\xc3\x93 The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in '
b'knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the \nsupreme proprietor of all bodies.The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is H\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9dke\xe2\x80\x9ca, which means controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: \xc3\x92I am also the knower.\xc3\x93 This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:k\xc5\x92etr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai hi \xe2\x80\x9car\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai b\xe2\x80\x9dja\xe2\x80\xb9 c\xe2\x88\x92pi \xe2\x80\x9cubh\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cubhet\xe2\x88\x92ni vetti sa yog\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 tata\xc5\xa1 k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a ucyate.This body is called the k\xc5\x92etra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is \ndescribed as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam. That is the opinion of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of prak\xe2\x80\x9eti, nature, and puru\xc5\x92a, the enjoyer of the nature, and \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara, the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul. One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language: \xc3\x92bhokt\xe2\x88\x92 bhogya\xe2\x80\xb9 prerit\xe2\x88\x92ra\xe2\x80\xb9 ca matv\xe2\x88\x92 sarva\xe2\x80\xb9 prokta\xe2\x80\xb9 tri-vidha\xe2\x80\xb9 brahmam etat.\xc3\x93 There are three Brahman conceptions: prak\xe2\x80\x9eti is Brahman as '
b'the field of activities, and the j\xe2\x80\x9dva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible. One is superior and the other is subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly that \xc3\x92I am also the knower of the field of activity.\xc3\x93 One who misunderstands a \nrope to be a serpent is not in knowledge. There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies. Because each individual soul has his individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different bodies. But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller. The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies. That is the opinion of \nevery body apart from the individual soul. And K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa explicitly says here that \nthe Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.

TRANSLATION
Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are.
PURPORTThe Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of activities in their constitutional positions. One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. One \nshould also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul, the different influences, their potentials, etc. One just has to understand this Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified. But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to be the j\xe2\x80\x9dva. This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.

That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings\xc3\x91especially in the 
PURPORTThe Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge. Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta, which are accepted as authority. First, He says, this is according to different sages. As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva, the author of the is a great sage, and in the duality is perfectly explained. And Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva\xc3\x95s father, Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara, was also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: \xc3\x92aham tva\xe2\x80\xb9 ca ath\xe2\x88\x92nye\xc3\x89\xc3\x93 \xc3\x92We\xc3\x91you, I and various other living entities\xc3\x91are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some \nare in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\xc3\x93 Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad.There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord\xc3\x95s energy known as annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence. This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme. Then there is pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aamaya; this means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms. In j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92namaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, and willing. Then there is Brahman realization and the realization called vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92namaya by which the living entity\xc3\x95s mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity \nhimself. The next and supreme stage is \xe2\x88\x92nandamaya, realization of the all-'
b'blissful nature. Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham. Out of these the first three!annamaya, pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aamaya, and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92namaya!involve the fields of activities of the living entities. Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called \xe2\x88\x92nandamaya. In the also the Supreme is called \xe2\x88\x92nandamayo \xc3\x95bhy\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x88\x92t. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92namaya, pr\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aamaya, j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92namaya, and annamaya. In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the \xe2\x88\x92nandamaya. That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the \xe2\x88\x92nandamaya, then he becomes perfect. This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.

The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions\xc3\x91all these are considered, in \nsummary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.
PURPORTFrom all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the the components of this world are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements  Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three \nmodes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, \nears, nose, tongue and touch. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus and the genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, warmth, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field \nof activity. Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body\xc3\x91mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities.The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego. They are a representation in the material conception. Consciousness is represented \nby intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material nature. The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradh\xe2\x88\x92na.One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their \ninteractions should study the philosophy in more detail. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, a summary only is given.'
b'The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes. Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing. However, the k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a, the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.

TRANSLATION
Humility, pridelessness, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, approaching a bona fide spiritual master, cleanliness, steadiness and self-control; renunciation of the objects of sense gratification, absence of false ego, the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; nonattachment to children, wife, home and \nthe rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events; constant and unalloyed devotion to Me, resorting to solitary places, detachment from the '
b'general mass of people; accepting the importance of self-realization, and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth\xc3\x91all these I thus declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to these is ignorance.
PURPORTThis process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the \ntenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So, if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But, if one takes to devotional service in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the other nineteen items \nautomatically develop within him. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows: \nHumility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge!who knows that he is not this body!anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding \nthe principles of religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing. He can judge by these items.'
b'Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains. So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement. That is nonviolence.Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor \nfrom others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. This is expected because material nature is so constituted. Even a boy like Prahl\xe2\x88\x92da, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him. So, for making advancement in spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we \nshould be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple. Because a \nbona fide spiritual master is a representative of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple\xc3\x95s following the regulated principles. Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life. There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal. External cleanliness means \ntaking a bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa always and chant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma. Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma Hare Hare. This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life. Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress. And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is '
b'detrimental to the path of spiritual progress. One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress. This is real renunciation. The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification. One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary. The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life. The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue. If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses. The function of the \ntongue is to taste and to vibrate. Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and chanting Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. That will control the eyes. Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 is simply expounding the science of devotional service. Devotional service is the main and sole objective. Unintelligent commentators on the G\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 but devotional service.False ego means accepting this body as oneself. When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego. Ego is there. False ego is condemned, but not real ego. In the Vedic literature, it is said: aha\xe2\x80\xb9 brahm\xe2\x88\x92smi. I am Brahman, I am spirit. This \xc3\x92I am,\xc3\x93 the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization. This sense of \xc3\x92I am\xc3\x93 is ego, but when the sense of \xc3\x92I am\xc3\x93 is applied to this false body, it is false ego. When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego. There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity. We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.\nOne should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease. There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam the world of the unborn, the child\xc3\x95s stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described. It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful. Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death. Similarly at the time of death, '
b'there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures. These should be discussed. And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience. No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these. Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one \nshould have no feeling for these. They are natural objects of affection, but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them. The best process for making the home pleasant is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. If one is in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this process of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is very easy. One need only chant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship. These four will make one happy. One should train the members of his family in this way. The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. If one can mold his family life in this way to develop K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change \nfrom family life to renounced life. But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned. One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, just as Arjuna did. Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa realization, he accepted the instruction of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and fought and killed them. In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world \none can never be fully happy or fully miserable. Happiness and distress are concommitant factors of material life. One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equiposed in both cases. Generally, when we get something desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are distressed. But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will not '
b'agitate us. To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service; devotional service to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter. That process should be followed. Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men. That would go against his grain. One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association.\nNaturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time. There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, such research work and philosophical speculation have no value. That is more or less nonsensical. According to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul. One should make research \nto understand with what the self is concerned. That is recommended here.As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical. As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must \nconsider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul. The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life. This service of the individual \nsoul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated. So bhakti or \ndevotional service is eternal. One should be established in that philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\xe2\x80\xb9 yaj j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam advayam. \xc3\x92Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n.\xc3\x93 (Bh\xe2\x88\x92g. 1.2.11) Bhagav\xe2\x88\x92n is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that \nplatform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord. That is perfection of knowledge.Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor. Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the '
b'understanding of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he is at a lower stage of knowledge. If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated. It is clearly stated that without humility understanding is harmful. To think oneself God is most puffed up. Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he thinks, \xc3\x92I am God\xc3\x93 because of ignorance. One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord. Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material \nnature. One must know and be convinced of this truth.

I shall now explain the knowable, knowing which you will taste the eternal. This is beginningless, and it is subordinate to Me. It is called Brahman, the \nspirit, and it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.
PURPORTThe Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field. He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities. Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul \nrespectively. By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, '
b'one can relish the nectar of life. As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal. This is also confirmed here. There is no specific date at which the j\xe2\x80\x9dva was born. Nor can anyone trace out the history of j\xe2\x80\x9dv\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92\xc3\x95s manifestation from the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is beginningless. The Vedic literature confirms this: na j\xe2\x88\x92yate m\xe2\x80\x9ejayate v\xe2\x88\x92 vipa\xe2\x80\x9ccit. The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge. The Supreme Lord is also stated in the Vedic literature as pradh\xe2\x88\x92na-k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a-patir gu\xe2\x80\x9ae\xe2\x80\x9ca\xc5\xa1. The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is \nthe master of the three modes of material nature. In the sm\xe2\x80\x9eti it is said: d\xe2\x88\x92sa-The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching; therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na\xe2\x80\xb9 brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma. Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of \nGodhead.

TRANSLATION
Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything. In this way the Supersoul exists.'
b'
PURPORTAs the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or Supreme Personality of Godhead. He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is \nnot possible. If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or \na little water, He accepts. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 it is stated, goloka eva nivasati: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of \nGodhead, not the individual soul.

TRANSLATION
The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends \nthe modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of material nature.
PURPORTThe Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn\xc3\x95t have material senses like they have. Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through \nmatter. The Supreme Lord\xc3\x95s senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirgu\xe2\x80\x9aa. Gu\xe2\x80\x9aa means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad in the verse: sarvata\xc5\xa1 p\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ai-p\xe2\x88\x92dam. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no \nhands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes\xc3\x91otherwise how could He see? He sees everything, past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92: He knows everything, but no one \nknows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.'
b'Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency. He is not contaminated by the material energy because He is the Lord of material energy. In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual. He has His eternal form called sac-cid-\xe2\x88\x92nanda-vigraha. He is full of all opulence. He is the proprietor of all wealth and the \nowner of all energy. He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge. These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activities. As far as we \ncan understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental. Although we do not see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation then we can see the Lord\xc3\x95s form. Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form. Therefore the impersonalists who are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.

PURPORTIn Vedic literature we understand that N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa, the Supreme Person, is residing both outside and inside of every living entity. He is present both in the spiritual and material world. Although He is far, far away, still He is near to us. These are the statements of Vedic literature. y\xe2\x88\x92ti sarvata\xc5\xa1. And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence. We cannot see or understand with these material senses. Therefore in the Vedic language it is \nsaid that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act. But one who has purified his mind and senses by practicing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in devotional service can see Him constantly. It is confirmed in Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92 that the devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him \nalways, without cessation. And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 (11.54) that He can be seen and understood only by devotional service. Bhakty\xe2\x88\x92 tvananyay\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x80\x9cakya\xc5\xa1.

TRANSLATION
Although the Supersoul appears to be divided, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.'
b'
PURPORTThe Lord is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as the Supersoul. Does that mean that He has become divided? No. Actually, He is one. The example is given of the sun: the sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place. But if one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks, \xc3\x92Where is the sun?\xc3\x93 everyone will say that it is shining on his head. In the Vedic literature this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is said in Vedic literature that one Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is present everywhere by His \nomnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruk\xc5\x92etra. He also mentions that in the form of time He devours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He \ndevours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of al1. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the confirmations of Vedic hymns. yena j\xe2\x88\x92t\xe2\x88\x92ni j\xe2\x80\x9dvanti yat prayanty abhisa\xe2\x80\xb9vi\xe2\x80\x9canti tad brahma tad vijij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92sasva.

He is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart.
PURPORTThe Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc. In the Vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there. In the material world that brahmajyoti the Lord\xc3\x95s spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of \nsun, moon, electricity, etc., for light. But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things. It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated. It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world. He is situated in the spiritual world which is far, far away in the spiritual sky. That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature. \xe2\x80\xa2ditya-var\xe2\x80\x9aam tamasa\xc5\xa1 parast\xe2\x88\x92t. He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world. His \nknowledge is transcendental. The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge. To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart.One Vedic mantra says: ta\xe2\x80\xb9 ha devam \xe2\x88\x92tma-buddhi-prak\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9ca\xe2\x80\xb9 mumuk\xc5\x92ur vai \xe2\x80\x9cara\xe2\x80\x9aam aham prapadye. One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation. As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge \nis concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditv\xe2\x88\x92tim\xe2\x80\x9etyum eti. \xc3\x92Only by knowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death.\xc3\x93 He is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as the supreme controller. The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul. Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual soul and the Supersoul, must be admitted. One\xc3\x95s hands and legs are distributed locally, but K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s hands and legs are distributed everywhere. \nThis is confirmed in the \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad: sarvasya prabhum \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92na\xe2\x80\xb9 '
b'sarvasya \xe2\x80\x9cara\xe2\x80\x9aa\xe2\x80\xb9 b\xe2\x80\x9ehat. That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living entities. So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different.

TRANSLATION
Thus the field of activities [the body], knowledge, and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. Only My devotees can understand this thoroughly \nand thus attain to My nature.
PURPORTThe Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable. This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing. Combined, these are called vij\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92nam, or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s activities and realize that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is '
b'everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly.

TRANSLATION
Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless. Their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature.
PURPORTBy this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known. The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature. It is the individual soul which is embodied. Enjoying the activities of the body is the puru\xc5\x92a, or the living entity. He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul. Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.'
b'Both material nature and the living entity are eternal. That is to say that they existed before the creation. The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the superior energy. Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested. Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mah\xe2\x88\x92-Vis\xe2\x80\x9au, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva. Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are \nconditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord. Thus they are not \nallowed to enter into the spiritual sky. After the winding up of material nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world. That is the mystery of this material creation. Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature. It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact \nwith material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place. In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence. But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature. All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body. As far as spirit is concerned, \nliving entities are all the same.

TRANSLATION
Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.
PURPORTThe different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are the creation of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the 1iving entity, who thus desires to live in this \nbody or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures to the body. \nIt might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total\xc3\x91body and instrument senses\xc3\x91are offered by material nature, and, as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one\xc3\x95s desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant \nenjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the 1iving entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he \nmust act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all '
b'circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dv\xe2\x88\x92 supar\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 sayuj\xe2\x88\x92 sakh\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul or Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92.

TRANSLATION
The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. \nThus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.
PURPORTThis verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another. It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the \ninfluence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, '
b'sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.How he is put into such different bodies is explained here. It is due to association with the different modes of nature. One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position. That is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Unless one is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial. But he has to change that conception. That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources. The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he \ncomes to enjoy spiritual happiness. In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.

TRANSLATION
Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul.
PURPORTIt is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord. He is not an ordinary living entity. Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul. To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 in every body. He is different from the individual soul; He is para\xc5\xa1, \ntranscendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name is Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, not \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that the \xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 are different. The Supersoul, the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because He is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the \nindividual soul\xc3\x95s desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual is bhakta or the sustained, and He is bhukta or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends. But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and \nact independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual energy. As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy. The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is \ncontinually rejecting the association of spiritual light. This misuse of '
b'independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature. The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without. From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, and from within He tries to convince him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness. \xc3\x92Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me. Then you will be happy,\xc3\x93 He says. Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge

TRANSLATION
One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation. He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.
PURPORTClear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature. This is the result of knowledge. The purpose of knowledge is to understand \ndistinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material '
b'existence. By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness by understanding Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead. Then it is certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.

TRANSLATION
That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the cultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.
PURPORTThe Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two classes as far as man\xc3\x95s search for self-realization is concerned. Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted \namong the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the '
b'Supreme Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the second class. The atheistic philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are \nable to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Here it is stated that \nthere are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the ha\xc4\xb1ha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.

TRANSLATION
Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path \nof birth and death.
PURPORTThis verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters. Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually \nthere is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. Lord Caitanya, who preached K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. It is \nstated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, \nhear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.

TRANSLATION
O chief of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas, whatever you see in existence, both moving and unmoving, is only the combination of the field of activities and the knower of \nthe field.
PURPORTBoth material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the creation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse. Whatever is created is but a combination of the living entity and material nature. There are many manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but \ncombinations of material nature and superior nature, the living entity. Without the touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow. Therefore the relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures. The material nature is created by Him, and the superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities and manifestations take place.

TRANSLATION
One who sees the Supersoul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies and who understands that neither the soul nor the Supersoul is ever destroyed, \nactually sees.
PURPORTAnyone who can see three things\xc3\x91the body, the proprietor of the body, or individual soul, and the friend of the individual soul, combined together by good association\xc3\x91is actually in knowledge. Those who are not associated with the soul\xc3\x95s friend are ignorant; they simply see the body, and when the body is destroyed they think that everything is finished, but actually it is not so. After \nthe destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms. The Sanskrit word parame\xe2\x80\x9cvaram is sometimes translated as the individual soul because the soul is the master of the body, and after the destruction of the body he transfers to another form. In that way he is master. But there are others who interpret this parame\xe2\x80\x9cvaram to be the Supersoul. In either case, both the Supersoul and the individual soul continue. They are not destroyed. One who can see in this way \ncan actually see what is happening.

TRANSLATION
One who sees the Supersoul in every living being and equal everywhere does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches the transcendental \ndestination.
PURPORTThe living entity, by accepting his material existence as just so much suffering, can become situated in his spiritual existence. If one understands that the Supreme is situated in His Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 manifestation everywhere, that is, if one can see the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living thing, he does not degrade himself, and he therefore gradually advances \nin the spiritual world. The mind is generally addicted to self-centered processes; but when the mind turns to the Supersoul, one becomes advanced in spiritual understanding.

One who can see that all activities are performed by the body, which is created of material nature, and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees.
PURPORTThis body is made by material nature under the direction of the Supersoul, and whatever activities are going on in respect to one\xc3\x95s body are not his doing. Whatever one is supposed to do, either for happiness or for distress, one is forced to do because of the bodily constitution. The self, however, is outside all these bodily activities. This body is given according to one\xc3\x95s past desires. To fulfill desires, one is given the body, with which he acts accordingly. Practically speaking, the body is a machine, designed by the Supreme Lord, to fulfill desires. Because of desires, one is put into difficult circumstances to suffer or to enjoy. This transcendental vision of the living entity, when \ndeveloped, makes one separate from bodily activities. One who has such a vision is an actual seer.

TRANSLATION
When a sensible man ceases to see different identities, which are due to different material bodies, he attains to the Brahman conception. Thus he sees that beings are expanded everywhere.
PURPORTWhen one can see that the various bodies of living entities arise due to the different desires of the individual soul and do not actually belong to the soul itself, one actually sees. In the material conception of life, we find someone a demigod, someone a human being, a dog, a cat, etc. This is material vision, not actual vision. This material differentiation is due to a material conception of life. After the destruction of the material body, this spirit soul is one. The spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of bodies. When one can see this, he attains spiritual vision; thus being freed from \ndifferentiations like man, animal, big, low, etc., one becomes beautified in his consciousness and able to develop K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in his spiritual identity. How he then sees things will be explained in the next verse.

Those with the vision of eternity can see that the soul is transcendental, eternal, and beyond the modes of nature. Despite contact with the material body, O Arjuna, the soul neither does anything nor is entangled.
PURPORTA living entity appears to be born because of the birth of the material body, but actually the living entity is eternal; he is not born, and in spite of his being situated in a material body, he is transcendental and eternal. Thus he cannot be destroyed. By nature he is full of bliss. He does not engage himself in any material activities; therefore the activities performed due to his contact with material bodies do not entangle him.

The sky, due to its subtle nature, does not mix with anything, although it is all-pervading. Similarly, the soul, situated in Brahman vision, does not mix with the body, though situated in that body.'
b'
PURPORTThe air enters into water, mud, stool and whatever else is there; still it does not mix with anything. Similarly, the living entity, even though situated in varieties of bodies, is aloof from them due to his subtle nature. Therefore it is impossible to see with the material eyes how the living entity is in contact with this body and how he is out of it after the destruction of the body. No one in science can ascertain this.

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.
PURPORTThere are various theories regarding consciousness. Here in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the example of the sun and the sunshine is given. As the sun is situated in one place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.'
b'When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual \nsoul, is conscious of all bodies. That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness.

TRANSLATION
One who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also attains to the supreme goal.
PURPORTThe purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul. A faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God and '
b'thus gradually become enlightened. If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for further spiritual realization. A spiritual master teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instructions. For instance, in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we find K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations.One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements. That is the gross manifestation. And the subtle \nmanifestation is the mind and psychological effects. And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features. But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul. The soul and the Supersoul are two. This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements. One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the \nspiritual world. These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Thirteenth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of Nature, the Enjoyer, and Consciousness.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection.
PURPORTFrom the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna. If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service. In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed \nfrom material entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attain perfection and \ntransfer to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attain perfection. Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.

TRANSLATION
By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature, which is like My own nature. Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.
PURPORTAfter acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death. One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul. It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental \nloving service. So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature. But knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge. As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of the Supreme Person. Those who have no \nknowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness. However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also variegatedness. Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety. But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains spiritual form. There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life. That atmosphere \nis said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord. To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual '
b'qualities. One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world.

TRANSLATION
The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.
PURPORTThis is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of k\xc5\x92etra and k\xc5\x92etraj\xc5\x81a, the body and the spirit soul. This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself. The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman. The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible. This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: \nj\xe2\x88\x92yate. Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person. The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, '
b'fire and air, are all material energy, called Mah\xe2\x88\x92-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material nature. As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature\xc3\x91the living entity. In material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice. But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion. Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother. Similarly, material nature is not \nthe cause of the birth of the living entities. The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature. Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds. The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.

TRANSLATION
It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.'

PURPORTIn this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the original father of all living entities. The living entities are combinations of the material nature and the spiritual nature. Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is situated. Everywhere there are living entities; within the earth there are living entities, even within water and within fire. All these appearances are due to the mother, material nature, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x95s seed-giving \nprocess. The purport is that the living entities, being impregnated in the material world, come out and form at the time of creation according to their past deeds.

TRANSLATION
Material nature consists of the three modes\xc3\x91goodness, passion and ignorance. When the living entity comes in contact with nature, he becomes conditioned by these modes.
PURPORTThe living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this material nature. Still, because he has become conditioned by the material '
b'world, he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress.

TRANSLATION
O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that \nmode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.
PURPORTThe living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities\xc3\x95 conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of \nBhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not '
b'so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge \nand is better than others. In this way he becomes conditioned. The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness. This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature. As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to \ntake some type of body in the modes of nature. Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world. Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death. But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.

TRANSLATION
The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.
PURPORTThe mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with \nthe fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?

TRANSLATION
O son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.
PURPORTIn this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in \nthe Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to \nassociate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.'

TRANSLATION
The mode of goodness conditions one to happiness, passion conditions him to the fruits of action, and ignorance to madness.
PURPORTA person in the mode of goodness is satisfied by his work or intellectual pursuit, just as a philosopher, scientist, or educator may be engaged in a particular field of knowledge and may be satisfied in that way. A man in the modes of passion and goodness may be engaged in fruitive activity; he owns as much as he can and spends for good causes. Sometimes he tries to open \nhospitals, give to charity institutions, etc. These are the signs of one in the mode of passion. And the mode of ignorance covers knowledge. In the mode of ignorance, whatever one does is neither good for him nor for anyone.

TRANSLATION
Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent, defeating the mode of goodness, O son of Bharata. And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats \npassion, and at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion. \nIn this way there is always competition for supremacy.
PURPORTWhen the mode of passion is prominent, the modes of goodness and ignorance are defeated. When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are defeated. And, when the mode of ignorance is prominent, passion and goodness are defeated. This competition is always going on. Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness has to transcend these three modes. The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one\xc3\x95s dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc. All this \nwill be explained in later chapters. But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion. One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance. Or, one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion. Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated in pure goodness, \nwhich is called the v\xe2\x88\x92sudeva state, a state in which one can understand the '

The manifestations of the mode of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge.
PURPORTThere are nine gates in the body: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the genital and the anus. In every gate, when the symptom of goodness is illuminated, it should be understood that one has developed the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, one can see things in the right position, one can hear things in the right position, and one can taste things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness, and that is the position of \ngoodness.

All these symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion.

When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities; and when he dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom.
PURPORTSome people have the impression that when the soul reaches the platform of human life, it never goes down again. This is incorrect. According to this verse, if one develops the mode of ignorance, after his death he is degraded to '
b'the animal form of life. From there one has to again elevate himself, by evolutionary process, to come again to the human form of life. Therefore, those who are actually serious about human life should take to the mode of goodness and in good association transcend the modes and become situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. This is the aim of human life. Otherwise, there is no guarantee that the human being will again attain to the human status.

TRANSLATION
By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode of passion result in distress, and actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness.
PURPORTBy pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified; therefore the sages, who are free from all illusion, are situated in happiness. Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. If, for example, one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass \nof wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render '
b'physical toil. The miseries are there. Thus Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be a little so-called mental happiness\xc3\x91\xc3\x92I have this house or this money\xc3\x93\xc3\x91but this is not actual happiness. As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life. Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, the animals do not understand this. Slaughtering poor \nanimals is also due to the mode of ignorance. The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them. That is the law of nature. In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged. That is the law of the state. Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord. Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant\xc3\x95s being killed. One has to pay for it. So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the \ntongue is the grossest kind of ignorance. A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things. If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark. Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk. Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance. In the Vedic literature the words gobhi\xc5\xa1 pr\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9aita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully \nsatisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance. There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:namo brahma\xe2\x80\x9aya-dev\xe2\x88\x92ya go-br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa-hit\xe2\x88\x92ya cajagaddhit\xe2\x88\x92ya k\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92ya govind\xe2\x88\x92ya namo nama\xc5\xa1.\xc3\x92My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world.\xc3\x93 The purport is that special \nmention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas. Br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the cows, must be given all protection\xc3\x91that is real advancement of \ncivilization. In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged. It is to be understood, then, that human society is \nadvancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own '
b'condemnation. A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization. The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance. It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.

From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and \nillusion develop.
PURPORTSince the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is recommended. Through K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness. When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are. In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly. In the mode of ignorance, for example, \nthey do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being '
b'killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren\xc3\x95t happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the \npossibility for peace and prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he \nhas to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark.

TRANSLATION
Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.
PURPORTIn this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth. There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated. According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system. The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, resides. We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can \nbring us to this.The mode of passion is mixed. It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance. A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man. But because there are mixtures, one can also go down. People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine. In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of \nbecoming mad in the next life.The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable. The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky. It is the lowest quality in material nature. Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions. The word t\xe2\x88\x92mas\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 is very significant here. T\xe2\x88\x92mas\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1 indicates those who stay \ncontinually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode. Their future is very dark.'
b'There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue in the lower modes.

TRANSLATION
When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can know My spiritual nature.
PURPORTOne can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real spiritual master is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one\xc3\x95s life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the \nmaterial modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but '
b'when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become fixed in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. A man in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is \nnot controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is relieved from the activities of material nature. Therefore for one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.

PURPORTHow one can stay in the transcendental position, even in this body, in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, is explained in this verse. The Sanskrit word deh\xe2\x80\x9d means embodied. Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature. He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky. But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness. In other words, devotional service in \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement, and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.

Arjuna inquired: O my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who is transcendental to those modes? What is his behavior? And how does he \ntranscend the modes of nature?'
b'
PURPORTIn this verse, Arjuna\xc3\x95s questions are very appropriate. He wants to know the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes. He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person. How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are. Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature. That is very important. \nUnless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms. So all these questions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them.

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is \nseated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active; who regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a \npiece of gold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same; who is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings\xc3\x91such a man is said to have \ntranscended the modes of nature.'
b'
PURPORTArjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another. In these verses, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of \nthe material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is \naloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person. The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by \nsuch false honor and dishonor. He performs his duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him. He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold. He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy. He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do \nwith material existence. Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances. He does not attempt anything for his own sake. He can attempt anything for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but for his personal self he does not attain anything. By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.'

TRANSLATION
One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.
PURPORTThis verse is a reply to Arjuna\xc3\x95s third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa activities. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa activities are known as bhakti-yoga\xc3\x91always acting for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This includes not only K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, but His different plenary expansions such as R\xe2\x88\x92ma and N\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\x9aa. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in \nthe service of any of the forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they '
b'possess all transcendental qualities. So, if one engages himself in the service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily. This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the \nSupreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity\xc3\x95s spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity \nof exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahm\xe2\x88\x92pyeti. One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman. \nThis means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman. By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as \nindividual soul.

TRANSLATION
And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.
PURPORTThe constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness. Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization. Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate \nrealization of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, both Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates \nhimself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme. This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. \nThere are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kum\xe2\x88\x92ras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down. In \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite \nof being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if '
b'one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai sa\xc5\xa1; rasa\xe2\x80\xb9 hy ev\xe2\x88\x92ya\xe2\x80\xb9 labdhv\xe2\x88\x92nand\xe2\x80\x9d bhavati. \xc3\x92When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he \nactually becomes transcendentally blissful.\xc3\x93 The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, \nor imperishability is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down. In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance. Due to the association of \nthese three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there. By engagement in devotional service in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering!the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service!should be practiced in the association of devotees. Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the \nspiritual master, one\xc3\x95s material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord\xc3\x95s transcendental loving service. This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter. Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the \nLord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ana, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees. By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.
PURPORTAfter the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, \xc3\x92What about the Vedas?\xc3\x93 It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Therefore one who is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree. \nFor one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan \ntree. He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another. The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation. The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree. This tree\xc3\x95s roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is located, the topmost planet of this universe. If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.\nThis process of extrication should be understood. In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement. And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way. Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord. The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter. \nThe root of this material existence grows upward. This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe. From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems. The fruits represent the results of the living entities\xc3\x95 activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its \nbranches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing. That tree can '
b'be found beside a reservoir of water. We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up. In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world. This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the tree\xc3\x95s reflection is situated on water. Desire is the cause of things\xc3\x95 being situated in this reflected material light. One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study. Then he can cut off his relationship with it.\nThis tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica. Everything is there in the spiritual world. The impersonalists take Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to s\xe2\x88\x92\xef\xac\x81khya philosophy, come prak\xe2\x80\x9eti, puru\xc5\x92a, then the three gu\xe2\x80\x9aas, then the five gross elements (pa\xc5\x81ca-then the ten senses (da\xe2\x80\x9cendriya), mind, etc. In this way they divide up the whole material world. If Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 \ndegrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world. The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality. The prak\xe2\x80\x9eti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the puru\xc5\x92a is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary. A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen. But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal. The \nmaterial reflection of the real tree has to be cut off. When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world. If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas. One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree. He does not exactly know \nthe purpose of the Vedas. The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain \nthe real tree of the spiritual world.

TRANSLATION
The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.
PURPORTThe description of the banyan tree is further explained here. Its branches are spread in all directions. In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc. These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas (fairies), and many other higher species of life. As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature. Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient \nwater, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested in that proportion.The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects. By development of the different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses, we enjoy different varieties of sense objects. The source of the senses!the ears, the nose, eyes, etc.!is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the enjoyment of different sense objects. The leaves are sound, form, touch!the sense objects. The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different '
b'varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment. Thus we develop attachment and aversion. The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the secondary roots, spreading in all directions. The real root is from Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems. After one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion. This planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.

TRANSLATION
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So \ndoing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never \nreturns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.
PURPORTIt is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. \xc3\x92I am the son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc.\xc3\x93 By searching in this way, one comes to Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, who is generated by the Garbhodaka\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x80\x9d Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search \nout that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree.The word asa\xef\xac\x81ga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong. \nTherefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the first thing one must do is surrender to Him. The description of that place whence going no one returns to this false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, is the original root from whom everything has emanated. To \ngain favor of that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc. He is the '
b'cause of this extension of this material world. This is already explained by the Lord Himself: aha\xe2\x80\xb9 sarvasya prabhava\xc5\xa1. \xc3\x92I am the origin of everything.\xc3\x93Therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life, one must surrender to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. As soon as one surrenders unto K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, he becomes detached automatically from this material extension.

TRANSLATION
One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the \nduality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.
PURPORTThe surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of '
b'material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering that the land, this earth, belongs to human \nsociety, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social, and national affections. These fake associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And, \nwhen one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One who reaches it never returns to this material world.
PURPORTThe spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa\xc3\x91which is known as K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana\xc3\x91is described here. In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous. We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous. The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1has) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti. Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana. Part \nof that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world. \nOther than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaiku\xe2\x80\x9a\xc4\xb1has, chief of which is Goloka V\xe2\x80\x9end\xe2\x88\x92vana.As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated. Then there is no chance of his coming back here. In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state \nhe enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the Supreme Lord. There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.One should be captivated by this information. He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality. For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there is a chance of gradually becoming detached. One has to associate himself with \ndevotees, those who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. One should search out a society dedicated to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service. In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world. One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth. He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore one should take it very seriously that '
b'devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree. In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described. Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.The words parama\xe2\x80\xb9 mama are very important here. Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences. In the Upani\xc5\x92ads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole \nspiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord.

TRANSLATION
The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.
PURPORTIn this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given. The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord\xc3\x91eternally. It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated '
b'state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said, san\xe2\x88\x92tana\xc5\xa1. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord R\xe2\x88\x92ma, N\xe2\x80\x9esi\xe2\x80\xb9hadeva, \nseparated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that \nindependence, one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material \nworld.The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world!Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, Lord \xe2\x80\xa1iva, and even Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au!are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations. The word kar\xc5\x92ati (struggling or grappling hard) is very significant. The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains. He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which \nis driving him in this material existence. When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life. It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity. The following information '
b'is there in the M\xe2\x88\x92dhyandi-n\xe2\x88\x92yana-\xe2\x80\x9cruti: sa v\xe2\x88\x92 e\xc5\x92a brahma-ni\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1ha ida\xe2\x80\xb9 sar\xe2\x80\x9dra\xe2\x80\xb9 marttyam atis\xe2\x80\x9ejya brahm\xe2\x88\x92bhisampadya brahma\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 pa\xe2\x80\x9cyati brahma\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9enoti brahma\xe2\x80\x9aaiveda\xe2\x80\xb9 sarvam anubhavati. It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is. In sm\xe2\x80\x9eti also it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead\xc3\x95s. As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.The word mamaiv\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9ca\xc5\xa1 (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant. The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like \nsome material broken part. We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces. This fragment is not materially conceived. It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again. That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word san\xe2\x88\x92tana (eternal) is used. The fragmental portion is eternal. It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino \xc3\x95smin yath\xe2\x88\x92) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present. That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord. It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.

TRANSLATION
The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.
PURPORTHere the living entity is described as \xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cvara, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat\xc3\x95s or dog\xc3\x95s body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And, if he is in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he will be \ntransferred to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of \ntransmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called kar\xc5\x92ati or struggle for existence.'

TRANSLATION
The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.
PURPORTIn other words, if the living entity adulterates his consciousness with the qualities of cats and dogs, in his next life he gets a cat or dog body and enjoys. Consciousness is originally pure, like water. But if we mix water with a certain color, it changes. Similarly, consciousness is pure, for the spirit soul is pure. But consciousness is changed according to the association of the material qualities. Real consciousness is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. When, therefore, one is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, he is in his pure life. But if his consciousness is adulterated by some type of material mentality, in the next life he gets a corresponding body. He does not necessarily get a human body again; he can \nget the body of a cat, dog, hog, demigod or one of many other forms, for there are 8,400,000 species.'

TRANSLATION
The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.
PURPORTThe word j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-cak\xc5\x92u\xc5\x92a\xc5\xa1 is very significant. Without knowledge, one cannot understand how a living entity leaves his present body, nor what form of body he is going to take in the next life, nor even why he is living in a particular type of body. This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under \nthe spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the '
b'spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome. They should come out of it and be K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world.

TRANSLATION
The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see \nwhat is taking place, though they may try to.
PURPORTThere are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity. The word yogina\xc5\xa1 is significant in this connection. In the present day there are many so-called yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, and there '
b'are many so-called associations of yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization. They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy. They have no other information. They are called yatanto \xc3\x95py ak\xe2\x80\x9et\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92na\xc5\xa1. Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized. Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul. Only those who are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yog\xe2\x80\x9ds, those engaged in pure \ndevotional service in Krs\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.

TRANSLATION
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.
PURPORTThe unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place. The beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here. Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity. One should '
b'simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such a conception of life, the beginning of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world. The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home. From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system. There are different universes and solar \nsystems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also. Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord. With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up. They set fire to prepare their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc. So many things are done with the help of fire. Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities. Without their help no living entity can live. So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are \nemanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, then one\xc3\x95s K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness will begin. By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished. The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live. These are some thoughts to provoke K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa \nconsciousness in the conditioned soul.

TRANSLATION
I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.
PURPORTIt is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in the Brahm\xe2\x88\x92-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, enters \ninto the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, it sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality \nof Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things stay in their place. It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not \nfor Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon\xc3\x95s influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word ras\xe2\x88\x92tmaka\xc5\xa1 is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the \nagency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon.'

TRANSLATION
I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life, outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.
PURPORTAccording to \xe2\x80\xa2yur-vedic \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stra, we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing, there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras also confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff. Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His grace, we are enjoying life. In the this is also confirmed: \xe2\x80\x9cabd\xe2\x88\x92dibhyo \xc3\x95nta\xc5\xa1 prati\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1h\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92c ca. The Lord is situated within \nsound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are '
b'chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.

TRANSLATION
I am seated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.
PURPORTThe Supreme Lord is situated as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 in everyone\xc3\x95s heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal '
b'Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in His incarnation as Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva is the compiler of the . The commentation on the  by Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva in the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam gives the real understanding of . The Supreme Lord is so full that for the \ndeliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, the teacher of the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.Anta\xc5\xa1pravi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a\xc5\xa1 \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92st\xe2\x88\x92 jan\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m. The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord. \nAlthough he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa gives the \nrequired intelligence. Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand \nK\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Vedic literature confirms this: yo \xc3\x95sau sarvair vedair g\xe2\x80\x9dyate. In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas,  and the Upani\xc5\x92ads and Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. The Vedas give us direction to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and the \nprocess of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead.  confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay\xe2\x88\x92t. One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.'

TRANSLATION
There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.
PURPORTAs already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva compiled the Ved\xe2\x88\x92nta-sutra. Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes\xc3\x91the fallible and the infallible. The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When they are in contact with the material world, they are called and the Sanskrit words given here, mean that they are fallible. \nThose who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible. Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, \nbut that there is no disunity. They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation. Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.'
b'According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, there are two classes of men. The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it. The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned. One\xc3\x95s body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing. But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change. In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes!birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing. These are the changes of the material body. But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death. There all exists in oneness. It is more clearly explained as any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible. In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.

PURPORTThis verse is very nicely expressed in the Ka\xc4\xb1ha Upani\xc5\x92ad and \xe2\x80\xa1vet\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cvatara Upani\xc5\x92ad. It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality who is Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. The Upanisadic verse runs as follows: nityo nity\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\xb9 cetana\xe2\x80\x9c cetan\xe2\x88\x92n\xe2\x88\x92m. The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and \ngives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone\xc3\x95s heart as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects. There is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities. This particular word uttama is very significant. No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Loke is also significant because in the Pauru\xc5\x92a, a Vedic literature, it is stated: lokyate ved\xe2\x88\x92rtho \xc3\x95nena. This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 explains the purpose of the Vedas. The following verse also appears in the Vedas:t\xe2\x88\x92vad e\xc5\x92a sampras\xe2\x88\x92do \xc3\x95sm\xe2\x88\x92cchar\xe2\x80\x9dr\xe2\x88\x92t samutth\xe2\x88\x92ya para\xe2\x80\xb9\xc3\x92The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity. That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality.\xc3\x93 This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination. That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92. By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavat\xe2\x80\x9d and Par\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9cara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vy\xe2\x88\x92sadeva.'

Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person.

He is, therefore, the greatest of personalities. Now it is clear here that the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are individuals. The difference is that the living entities, either in the conditioned state or in the liberated state, cannot surpass in quantity the inconceivable potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to be understood as the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata
PURPORTThere are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth. Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything. \nThe imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, this fact is being stressed at every step. And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.Vedic knowledge is called \xe2\x80\x9cruti learning by aural reception. One should \nactually receive the Vedic message from authorities like K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and His representatives. Here K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source. Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities. It is not that one should simply speculate academically. One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead. Anyone who is able to understand this, according to '
b'the Supreme Personality of Godhead, \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9d K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.The word bhajate is very significant. In many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord. If a person is engaged in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge. In the Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava parampar\xe2\x88\x92 it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the \nSupreme Absolute Truth. He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.

PURPORTThe Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. \nWherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual\xc3\x91the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.\nEveryone must take to this consciousness of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, O sinless one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very \ndifficult to understand K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the \nheart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of lording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart.'

TRANSLATION
The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one\xc3\x95s existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and \nfreedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; \nvigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor\xc3\x91these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.'
b'
PURPORTIn the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained. Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prak\xe2\x80\x9eti, transcendental by nature. Those \nwho are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms. In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and \ndisadvantages of these qualities.The word abhij\xe2\x88\x92tasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbh\xe2\x88\x92dh\xe2\x88\x92na-sa\xe2\x80\xb9sk\xe2\x88\x92ra. If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is \nused in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Those who are in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness.The social institution known as var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma!the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes!is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. \nThey are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world. In the var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama institution the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa is considered to be the '
b'spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the k\xc5\x92atriyas, the vai\xe2\x80\x9cyas and the but a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas also. For a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks, \xc3\x92After leaving my connections, who will protect me?\xc3\x93 he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa or the Supreme Personality of \nGodhead in His localized aspect as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do. One must thus have firm conviction that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa as Param\xe2\x88\x92tm\xe2\x88\x92 will take care of a soul surrendered to Him. \xc3\x92I shall never be alone,\xc3\x93 one should think. \xc3\x92Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, and He will give me all protection.\xc3\x93 That conviction is called abhayam, without fear. This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he \nhas to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even \nforbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, and when He was at Pur\xe2\x80\x9d His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a \nstricture imposed on the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned \nsouls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa order of the life in connection with association with woman. One of His personal \nassociates, namely Cho\xc4\xb1a Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Cho\xc4\xb1a Harid\xe2\x88\x92sa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, \xc3\x92For a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d or anyone who is '
b'aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification!not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity!is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.\xc3\x93 So these are the processes for purification.The next item is j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga-vyavasthiti\xc5\xa1: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. Sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d life is meant for distributing knowledge to the \nhouseholders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. This is the duty of a sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d. If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his \nspiritual master, he should preach K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A sanny\xe2\x88\x92s\xe2\x80\x9d or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-sa\xe2\x80\xb9\xe2\x80\x9cuddhi\xc5\xa1 (purity) and j\xc5\x81\xe2\x88\x92na-yoga (knowledge).\nThe next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is \nrecommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate K\xe2\x80\x9esna consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness.Then as far as dama\xc5\xa1 (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life '
b'unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If he is able to beget children who will \nbe in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha and sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa, have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the \nVedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sa\xef\xac\x81k\xe2\x80\x9drtana-yaj\xc5\x81a, the chanting of Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.\nThen sv\xe2\x88\x92dhy\xe2\x88\x92ya\xc5\xa1, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and \xe2\x88\x92rjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life. Brahmac\xe2\x88\x92r\xe2\x80\x9ds should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called sv\xe2\x88\x92dhy\xe2\x88\x92ya\xc5\xa1. Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, \nbrahmacarya, g\xe2\x80\x9ehastha, v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha and sanny\xe2\x88\x92sa. So after g\xe2\x80\x9ehastha, householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is tapasy\xe2\x88\x92. The entire var\xe2\x80\x9a\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama-dharma society is meant for tapasy\xe2\x88\x92. Without '
b'tapasy\xe2\x88\x92 or austerity no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92. Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying \nto gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don\xc3\x95t restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the Vedas.\nAs far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama, or g\xe2\x80\x9ehastha-\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama or v\xe2\x88\x92naprastha-\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9crama. One must live very simply.Ahi\xe2\x80\xb9s\xe2\x88\x92 means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply \nof grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real ahi\xe2\x80\xb9s\xe2\x88\x92 means not checking anyone\xc3\x95s progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one \ncategory of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one\xc3\x95s palate. This is called ahi\xe2\x80\xb9s\xe2\x88\x92.Satyam. This word means that one should not distort the truth for some \npersonal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding Vedas. \xe2\x80\xa1ruti means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.'
b'Akrodha\xc5\xa1 means to check anger. Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. Apai\xe2\x80\x9cunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. Hr\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\xa1 means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. Ac\xe2\x88\x92palam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word teja\xc5\xa1 used here is meant for the k\xc5\x92atriyas. The k\xc5\x92atriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it.\n\xe2\x80\xa1aucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one\xc3\x95s dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. N\xe2\x88\x92tim\xe2\x88\x92nit\xe2\x88\x92, not expecting honor, applies to the the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the  to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.\nAll these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.

TRANSLATION
Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance\xc3\x91these qualities belong to those of demonic nature, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92.
PURPORTIn this verse, the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not \nrecognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities.

TRANSLATION
The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of P\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9a\xc5\xb8u, for you are born \nwith the divine qualities.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was considering the pro\xc3\x95s and con\xc3\x95s. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bh\xe2\x80\x9d\xc5\x92ma and Dro\xe2\x80\x9aa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not \nof the quality of the demons. For a k\xc5\x92atriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated.

O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demonic. I have already explained to you at \nlength the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.
PURPORTLord K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of \nauthoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Praj\xe2\x88\x92pati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not.

TRANSLATION
Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.
PURPORTIn every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the \xe2\x80\xa2ryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they \nwilling to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and \ninternal cleanliness.As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, which is the law of the human race. Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92. Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the Manu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92, it is '
b'clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However, this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age. \nThis is proper social behavior according to the Manu-sa\xe2\x80\xb9hit\xe2\x88\x92. But modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.

TRANSLATION
They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.'
b'
PURPORTThe demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the \nSupreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in \nenjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the \nmaterial combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa in sa-car\xe2\x88\x92caram. \xc3\x92Under My direction the whole material world is moving.\xc3\x93 In other words, amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as \nanother, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions.'

TRANSLATION
Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.
PURPORTThe demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But, according to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to \nbehave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take '
b'place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

TRANSLATION
The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the \nimpermanent.
PURPORTThe demoniac mentality is described here. The demons\xc3\x95 lust is never satiated. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. \nThe result is that they become more and more attracted to two things\xc3\x91sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word a\xe2\x80\x9cuci-vrat\xe2\x88\x92\xc5\xa1, '
b'unclean vow, is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their a\xe2\x80\x9cuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.

TRANSLATION
They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure \nmoney by illegal means for sense gratification.
PURPORTThe demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies \naccording to one\xc3\x95s karma, or activities in this world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man\xc3\x95s \ndesire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic literature, the Upani\xc5\x92ads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is \nacting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.

TRANSLATION
Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.
PURPORTThe demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money. That is unlimited. He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther. For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification. He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them. He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds. He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all '
b'his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma. According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past. The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability. He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education. Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy. There are many \ndemoniac people, and each is enemy to the others. This enmity becomes more and more deep\xc3\x91between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations. Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others. Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: \xc3\x92Why are you seeking God elsewhere? \nYou are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do. Don\xc3\x95t believe in God. Throw away God. God is dead.\xc3\x93 These are the demoniac\xc3\x95s preachings.Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him. As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yaj\xc5\x81as or sacrifices. Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yaj\xc5\x81a and prepare some \nmachine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet. The best example of such a demoniac man was R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa. He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas. Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement. These are examples of bewilderment. The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding \ntoward hell. Here the Sanskrit word mohaj\xe2\x88\x92la is very significant. J\xe2\x88\x92la means net; like fishes caught in a net, they have no way to come out.

TRANSLATION
Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations.
PURPORTThinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such \ndemons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions \nfor one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one\xc3\x95s own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion.'

TRANSLATION
Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.
PURPORTA demoniac person, being always against God\xc3\x95s supremacy, does not like to believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false \narguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independant and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power, or in wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the '
b'advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power.

TRANSLATION
Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.
PURPORTIn this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will. The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life\xc3\x91animals, insects, men, and so on. All \nare arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs '
b'of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. They are just like so many beasts in a jungle.

TRANSLATION
Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.
PURPORTIt is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God \nshould not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in the we find that the Supreme '
b'Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras\xc3\x91R\xe2\x88\x92va\xe2\x80\x9aa, Ka\xe2\x80\xb9sa, Hira\xe2\x80\x9ayaka\xe2\x80\x9cipu\xc3\x91to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill. Therefore God\xc3\x95s mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.

TRANSLATION
The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunt\xe2\x80\x9d, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.
PURPORTOne should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, anger, and greed. The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his existence becomes pure. Then he can follow the rules and regulations enjoined in the Vedic literature. By following the regulative principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization. If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him. In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification. The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger. \nBy cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the '

But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.
PURPORTAs described before, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stra-vidhim, or the direction of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stra, is given to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts \nwhimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does '
b'not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise.The word k\xe2\x88\x92ma-c\xe2\x88\x92rata\xc5\xa1 is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be \ncondemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one\xc3\x95s existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain the real stage of happiness.

PURPORTAs stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all the rules and regulations of the Vedas are meant for knowing K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. If one understands Krs\xe2\x80\x9aa from the Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 and becomes situated in Krs\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, engaging himself in devotional service, he has reached the highest perfection of knowledge offered by the Vedic literature. Lord Caitanya Mah\xe2\x88\x92prabhu made this process very easy: He asked people simply to chant Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, Hare Hare/ Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare R\xe2\x88\x92ma, R\xe2\x88\x92ma R\xe2\x88\x92ma, Hare Hare and to \nengage in the devotional service of the Lord and eat the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Deity. One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krs\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas. One should act accordingly, without argument. That is called \nfollowing the principles of \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stra, or scripture. \xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x88\x92stra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned. These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations. Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stra\xc3\x91being above these defects\xc3\x91are accepted without alteration by all great saints, \xe2\x88\x92c\xe2\x88\x92ryas, and great souls.\nIn India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist. Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas. Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage. One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x88\x92stras is considered fortunate.\nIn human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme \nPersonality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns. That is the greatest offense of human life. Therefore, m\xe2\x88\x92y\xe2\x88\x92, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries. This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature. One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened. Without '
b'raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life. Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures. In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted. Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation. These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life. If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper \nand bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one\xc3\x95s life becomes successful.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Sixteenth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Divine and Demoniac Natures.'

Arjuna said, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?
PURPORTIn the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures \nbut who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one\xc3\x95s faith can be of three kinds\xc3\x91goodness, passion or \nignorance. Now hear about these.
PURPORTThose who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the \ndifferent modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become \nelevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.

TRANSLATION
According to one\xc3\x95s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith \naccording to the modes he has acquired.
PURPORTEveryone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme \nLord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\xe2\x80\x9aa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to \nbecome cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. If one is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.'
b'The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One\xc3\x95s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one\xc3\x95s strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\xc3\x95s faith is not completely in \npurified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\xc3\x95s faith is established. It should be understood, that if one\xc3\x95s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his \nfaith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.

TRANSLATION
Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.
PURPORTIn this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the \ndemigods. The demigods include Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a \npowerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have \nseen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is said, sattva\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xe2\x80\x9cuddham v\xe2\x88\x92sudeva-\xe2\x80\x9cabditam. \xc3\x92When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva.\xc3\x93 The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of '
b'nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form is just another aspect of \nthe impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.

TRANSLATION
Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul dwelling within are to be known as demons.
PURPORTThere are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for \nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. \nThese acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\xc5\xa1 is significant in this connection\xc3\x91persons of normal mental condition must obey '
b'the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of \nVedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.

TRANSLATION
Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these.
PURPORTIn terms of different situations and the modes of material nature, there are differences in the manner of eating, performing sacrifices, austerities and charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can '
b'understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general.

TRANSLATION
Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one\xc3\x95s existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing '
b'foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is \nfood liked by people in the mode of ignorance.
PURPORTThc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life\xc3\x95s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn \nand molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out \nany need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially \nthose that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially \nthe spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, '
b'although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patra\xe2\x80\xb9 pu\xc5\x92pa\xe2\x80\xb9 phala\xe2\x80\xb9 toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras\xe2\x88\x92dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Of sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural rules, and with no expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness.
PURPORTThe general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but here it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire. It '
b'should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the \nmode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORTThe Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and penance. First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect, qualified br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should \nbe given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy.

Austerity of speech consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly.
PURPORTOne should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles, one\xc3\x95s statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, \none may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.

TRANSLATION
And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind.
PURPORTTo make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one\xc3\x95s nature is to become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we \nthink of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind\xc3\x95s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas and the Mah\xe2\x88\x92bh\xe2\x88\x92rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means \nthat one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.'

PURPORTIn the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended. There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa or a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of '
b'compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.

TRANSLATION
From the beginning of creation, the three syllables\xc3\x91om tat sat\xc3\x91have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were uttered by \nbr\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme.
PURPORTIt has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme\xc3\x91om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal\xc3\x91they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ao\xc5\xa1. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name \nof the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\xe2\x80\x9ao nedi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a\xe2\x80\xb9 n\xe2\x88\x92ma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the \nsecond goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first created living entity, '
b'performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\xc5\x92na consciousness. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.

TRANSLATION
But sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme are nonpermanent, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, regardless of whatever rites are performed. They are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next.
PURPORTAnything done without the transcendental objective\xc3\x91whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance-is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is \nthe understanding of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in '
b'K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yak\xc5\x92as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended \nin this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to Kr\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.'
