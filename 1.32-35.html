O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O \n\nfathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not \nprepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.
opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life is, however, different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing. Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa kill them personally. At this point he did not know that K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. This fact \nis disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\xc3\x95s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna \nwanted to excuse them.
