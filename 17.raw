CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Divisions of Faith


TEXT 1

Arjuna said, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?

TEXT 2

The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one\xc3\x95s faith can be of three kinds\xc3\x91goodness, passion or \nignorance. Now hear about these.


TEXT 3

According to one\xc3\x95s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith \naccording to the modes he has acquired.

TEXT 4

Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.

TEXTS 5-6

Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul dwelling within are to be known as demons.

TEXT 7

Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these.

TEXTS 8-10

Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one\xc3\x95s existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing '
foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is \nfood liked by people in the mode of ignorance.

TEXT 11

Of sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural rules, and with no expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness.

TEXT 12

But that sacrifice performed for some material end or benefit or performed ostentatiously, out of pride, is of the nature of passion, O chief of the Bh\xe2\x88\x92ratas.


TEXT 13

And that sacrifice performed in defiance of scriptural injunctions, in which no spiritual food is distributed, no hymns are chanted and no remunerations are made to the priests, and which is faithless\xc3\x91that sacrifice is of the nature of \nignorance.

TEXT 14

The austerity of the body consists in this: worship of the Supreme Lord, the br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas, the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother. \nCleanliness, simplicity, celibacy and nonviolence are also austerities of the body.

TEXT 15

Austerity of speech consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly.

TEXT 16

And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind.

TEXT 17

This threefold austerity, practiced by men whose aim is not to benefit themselves materially but to please the Supreme, is of the nature of goodness.

TEXT 18

Those ostentatious penances and austerities which are performed in order to gain respect, honor and reverence are said to be in the mode of passion. They are neither stable nor permanent.

TEXT 19

And those penances and austerities which are performed foolishly by means of obstinant self-torture, or to destroy or injure others, are said to be in the mode \nof ignorance.'

TEXT 20

That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy person, and without expectation of return, is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness.
compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.

TEXT 21

But charity performed with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruitive results, or in a grudging mood, is said to be charity in the mode of passion.

TEXT 22

And charity performed at an improper place and time and given to unworthy persons without respect and with contempt is charity in the mode of ignorance.

TEXT 23

From the beginning of creation, the three syllables\xc3\x91om tat sat\xc3\x91have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were uttered by \nbr\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme.
performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\xc5\x92na consciousness. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.

TEXT 24

Thus the transcendentalists undertake sacrifices, charities, and penances, beginning always with om, to attain the Supreme.

TEXT 25

One should perform sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose of such transcendental activities is to get free from the material entanglement.

TEXTS 26-27

The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat. These works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to the \nabsolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92.

TEXT 28

But sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme are nonpermanent, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, regardless of whatever rites are performed. They are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next.
