CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Divisions of Faith

TEXT 1

TRANSLATION
Arjuna said, O K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa, what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?
PURPORTIn the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity. In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod. Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures \nbut who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa.

TRANSLATION
The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one\xc3\x95s faith can be of three kinds\xc3\x91goodness, passion or \nignorance. Now hear about these.
PURPORTThose who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the modes of material nature. According to their previous activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality. The association of the living entity with the \ndifferent modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature. Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes. But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures. Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness. The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become \nelevated to the perfectional stage. One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master. Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.

TRANSLATION
According to one\xc3\x95s existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith \naccording to the modes he has acquired.
PURPORTEveryone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is. But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired. Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons. Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme \nLord. Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature. But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature. The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material. Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirgu\xe2\x80\x9aa, or transcendental. Therefore one has to \nbecome cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is the only path back without fear: K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. If one is situated in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage. If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.'
The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse. Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness. One\xc3\x95s faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction. It is supposed to be one\xc3\x95s strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness. But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified. They are mixed. They are not in pure goodness. Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As long as one\xc3\x95s faith is not completely in \npurified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature. The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart. Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one\xc3\x95s faith is established. It should be understood, that if one\xc3\x95s heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of goodness. If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion. And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his \nfaith is also thus contaminated. Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith. The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles. Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.

TRANSLATION
Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.
PURPORTIn this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities. According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the \ndemigods. The demigods include Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, \xe2\x80\xa1iva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a \npowerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits. Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man. Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness. Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts. We have \nseen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices. These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship. God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness. In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is said, sattva\xe2\x80\xb9 vi\xe2\x80\x9cuddham v\xe2\x88\x92sudeva-\xe2\x80\x9cabditam. \xc3\x92When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships V\xe2\x88\x92sudeva.\xc3\x93 The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of '
nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods. They worship the impersonal Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au, or Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au. Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9au form is just another aspect of \nthe impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahm\xe2\x88\x92 is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion. Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end. In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.

TRANSLATION
Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul dwelling within are to be known as demons.
PURPORTThere are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for \nmaterial enjoyment. By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. \nThese acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The word acetasa\xc5\xa1 is significant in this connection\xc3\x91persons of normal mental condition must obey '
the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of \nVedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.

TRANSLATION
Even food of which all partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. Listen, and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these.
PURPORTIn terms of different situations and the modes of material nature, there are differences in the manner of eating, performing sacrifices, austerities and charities. They are not all conducted on the same level. Those who can '
understand analytically what kind of performances are in what modes of material nature are actually wise; those who consider all kinds of sacrifice or foods or charity to be the same cannot discriminate, and they are foolish. There are missionary workers who advocate that one can do whatever he likes and attain perfection. But these foolish guides are not acting according to the direction of the scripture. They are manufacturing ways and misleading the people in general.

TRANSLATION
Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one\xc3\x95s existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such nourishing '
foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is \nfood liked by people in the mode of ignorance.
PURPORTThc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength. This is its only purpose. In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life\xc3\x95s duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn \nand molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out \nany need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease. Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially \nthose that are not fresh. Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except pras\xe2\x88\x92dam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness. Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially \nthe spiritual master. Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease. Such foodstuffs, '
although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness. The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion. Patra\xe2\x80\xb9 pu\xc5\x92pa\xe2\x80\xb9 phala\xe2\x80\xb9 toyam. Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts. But it is also mentioned that the pras\xe2\x88\x92dam should be prepared in a particular way. Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental. Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

TRANSLATION
Of sacrifices, that sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural rules, and with no expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness.
PURPORTThe general tendency is to offer sacrifice with some purpose in mind, but here it is stated that sacrifice should be performed without any such desire. It '
should be done as a matter of duty. Take, for example, the performance of rituals in temples or in churches. Generally they are performed with the purpose of material benefit, but that is not in the mode of goodness. One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables. Everyone thinks that there is no use in going to the temple just to worship God. But worship for economic benefit is not recommended in the scriptural injunction. One should go simply to offer respect to the Deity. That will place one in the \nmode of goodness. It is the duty of every civilized man to obey the injunctions of the scriptures and offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORTThe Supreme Godhead here explains the different kinds of austerity and penance. First He explains the austerities and penances practiced by the body. One should offer, or learn to offer, respect to God or to the demigods, the perfect, qualified br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas and the spiritual master and superiors like father, mother or any person who is conversant with Vedic knowledge. These should \nbe given proper respect. One should practice cleansing oneself externally and internally, and he should learn to become simple in behavior. He should not do anything which is not sanctioned by the scriptural injunction. He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise. This is called celibacy. These are penances and austerities as far as the body is concerned.

Austerity of speech consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly.
PURPORTOne should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others. Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds. This is penance as far as talking is concerned. Besides that, one should not talk nonsense. When speaking in spiritual circles, one\xc3\x95s statements must be upheld by the scriptures. One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying. At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear. By such discussions, \none may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society. There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this. This is called penance of speech.

TRANSLATION
And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind.
PURPORTTo make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate from K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one\xc3\x95s nature is to become K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa conscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we \nthink of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind\xc3\x95s becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Pur\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x80\x9aas and the Mah\xe2\x88\x92bh\xe2\x88\x92rata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means \nthat one is always thinking of self-realization. The person in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.'

PURPORTIn the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended. There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately. Spiritual perfection is always a consideration. Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified br\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aa or a Vai\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aava (devotee) or in temples. Such charities should be given without any consideration of return. Charity to the poor is sometimes given out of '
compassion, but if a poor man is not worth giving charity to, then there is no spiritual advancement. In other words, indiscriminate charity is not recommended in the Vedic literature.

TRANSLATION
From the beginning of creation, the three syllables\xc3\x91om tat sat\xc3\x91have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They were uttered by \nbr\xe2\x88\x92hma\xe2\x80\x9aas while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme.
PURPORTIt has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature. When they are aimed at the Supreme\xc3\x91om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal\xc3\x91they become means for spiritual elevation. In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated. These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.\nOne who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth. He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life. The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness. Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality. The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad vi\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9ao\xc5\xa1. Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name \nof the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added. This is the indication of Vedic literature. These three words are taken from Vedic hymns. Om ity etad brahma\xe2\x80\x9ao nedi\xc5\x92\xc4\xb1a\xe2\x80\xb9 n\xe2\x88\x92ma indicates the first goal. Then tattvamasi indicates the \nsecond goal. And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal. Combined they become om tat sat. Formerly when Brahm\xe2\x88\x92, the first created living entity, '
performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same principle holds by disciplic succession. So this hymn has great significance. Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Kr\xc5\x92na consciousness. K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead. There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.

TRANSLATION
The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat. These works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to the \nabsolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92.
PURPORTThe words pra\xe2\x80\x9caste karma\xe2\x80\x9ai, or prescribed duties, indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes beginning from parental care up to the end of one\xc3\x95s life. Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity. In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat. The words sad-bh\xe2\x88\x92ve and s\xe2\x88\x92dhu-bh\xe2\x88\x92ve indicate the transcendental \nsituation. One who is acting in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious of activities in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is called In the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bh\xe2\x88\x92gavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter \nbecomes clear in the association of the devotees. Without good association, '
one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge. When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat. Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked. These words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities. This supreme om tat sat makes everything complete.

TRANSLATION
But sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme are nonpermanent, O son of P\xe2\x80\x9eth\xe2\x88\x92, regardless of whatever rites are performed. They are called asat and are useless both in this life and the next.
PURPORTAnything done without the transcendental objective\xc3\x91whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance-is useless. Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that such activities are abominable. Everything should be done for the Supreme in K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness. Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit. In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised. In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is \nthe understanding of K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa. No one can obtain success without following this principle. Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in '
K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master. That is the way to make everything successful.In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yak\xc5\x92as like Kuvera. The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature. Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to K\xe2\x80\x9e\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness, that is the best way. And that is recommended \nin this chapter. To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction. Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme. When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God. This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities. One should, therefore, take to Kr\xc5\x92\xe2\x80\x9aa consciousness directly. That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.Thus end the Bhaktivedanta Purports to the Seventeenth Chapter of the \xe2\x80\xa1r\xe2\x80\x9dmad-Bhagavad-g\xe2\x80\x9dt\xe2\x88\x92 in the matter of the Divisions of Faith.'
